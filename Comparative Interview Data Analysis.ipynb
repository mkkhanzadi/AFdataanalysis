      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tIt was 24, August 2009. And I came up with study permit. My whole point was just to come here and get my education rather than settling here or having an immigration experience. So, I just wanted to focus on the education part.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay, and what sort of program did you study?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tI took the post-secondary International Business program. So, it was a college program. And at the same time, it was a full-time study. So, during this program, I didn't have a chance to work, even though I had the chance to get the on campus work permit, but because of the timeframe, it was a really intense program. I didn't have a chance to work with doing this one year period.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay, so and what were the motivations behind your move? Like what what did you consider in making the decision to move to Canada?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tSo that's a good question actually. Not specifically Canada because I would like to start, I would like to back forward with a bit… a bit regarding the Austria experience because I always wanted to have an experience for the different cultures different kind of atmosphere that I could, I would have access to in this case, to gain more, not just the knowledge, not just the experience but to be part of an interaction, human interaction, because and then I decided to go to Austria which was part of the exchange program that I was in. I was doing my undergrad and political science. So, after that exchange program I felt totally different. My old stereotypes were demolished on my mind, which was amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd this was ? Where did you go? Sorry?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tAustria. So it was the year was 2008. So, the year after, I definitely wanted to have a chance to experience different cultures. So, I knew that European culture was pretty much the same, especially in the Western Europe. So especially on also the education system was the same. And I wanted to try either Australia, as I mentioned to you before or Canada. So, the main motivation was, of course, as I said, to broaden my horizons, for not just the educational aspect, but just to learn different cultures to engage with different kind of atmosphere. And I think education was good tool to get myself into that door. So, but making the decision specifically Canada, that was one of my father's friend that he's Turkish, but he got married with a Canadian. So yes, so he was highly recommending about going to Canada but he was mostly endorsing about immigration processes more easier in Canada, but I was insisting on the fact that my intention is not the immigration at first place compared to other like the majority of people. So, but he was still insisting on Australia is tough on immigration. So, you better just go to Canada. And, but the motivation was for me to go to Australia. I mean, for me to want to go to Australia was climate. Of course, it was nice climate, the landscape. The culture itself, have it looked from Turkey from my perspective, of course, I never been in Australia before. Yeah, so I made a decision of course with some of the endorsements from my friend. And also, the second part was there was an educational consultancy firm that they came to my campus when I was doing my undergrad in Turkey. And they did a seminar regarding the education institutions in Canada. So, that was also a bit tempting for me how to education system is good in Canada, I mean, compared to Turkey specifically, and it was also different… not entirely different, but there was certain differences compared to Europe. So, in this case, I would like to I just want to decide to move forward with Canada so that was the main reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay, great. Okay. And so this is I'm after your undergrad in Turkey and your ethnic background is Turkish?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tI am Turkish I was born in Turkey and raised in Turkey till 21-year-old. And after 21, I went to Austria, the one without the kangaroos. Yeah, that's the joke actually. So, yes, and 2008 was the year. But also, I have, over there because the international student community was so active, I didn't have a chance to engage with the Austrian culture itself. It was mostly field trips, backpacking and similar things. But other than that, I was mostly melted in the same pot with other international students. So, I think I would say it was a better experience for me because it was an amazing experience in terms of having some friendships from South Korea, from Australia to from US from parts of Europe, from Africa, so it was it was good. I mean, I had some roommates from Ireland and Spain. So, I never had this experience before. And it was teaching me so many things, how to share the common space, how to share different cultures and respect each other in certain terms, even though I wasn't accepting certain things at first place, but it's helped me to absorb and respect them. And then the next stage was to gain some cultural share. So, which was important for me, and then I enjoyed it. I enjoyed that time being and then yes, I decided to take the next step. And that was Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo why not Austria itself? Like why didn't you think of Austria as the did you think of it? Maybe?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tI never thought of it. I taught mostly in Europe, somewhere in Europe. I personally, I like Mediterranean countries because of the climate as well as the culture itself is more welcoming in general, again, it depends on person to person but and also, I knew from my knowledge and as well as some of the Turkish diaspora in Austria and Germany, and I was mostly talking with them day to day basis. So their Austrian experience wasn't that satisfactory in terms of racist behaviour in terms of, in terms of the how the integration process was missing and was not welcoming especially the first generation, the law and second generation and third generation they were partially pushing themselves where I wouldn't want to use ‘pushing’ but they would like to they wanted to try to be part of it. But again, the integration whole in Europe is all different country by country. People were thinking that just because of the common language Germany and Austria have the same kind of integration policy, but I think it's different. I found Germany is more welcoming, especially even though the integration fail. It was accepted by the chancellor. I think it was 2006 that he admitted publicly that integration process failed. But even though the integration process failed, I found during my trips in Germany, and also my classmates that who were from Germany, they were more welcoming, they were more friendly, and they didn't make me feel that I was stranger. But I had, I had two Austrian roommates that we were sharing the same building, but they were not that welcoming. And they were not that friendly. But maybe it's just we can limit for that two people. But in general, even when I was going to the supermarket or when I was going to a bar. It was different. I mean, you could sense that. It was a small town which is called, which is named Kufstein, but it's really closer to the one of the biggest cities in the western side of Austria. It's called Innsbrooke. So it's a 15 minutes difference, as you can imagine the differences in Europe is as I mean distances in Europe is not that huge. And there's a connectivity in terms of the location and the train system. The transportation system is well organized. So yeah, I mean, it was closer also to Munich as well, one of the biggest cities in Germany. So, it was 45 minutes remaining 15 minutes to Innsbrook. So, it was really good in terms of the location… to the Italy border, the Italian border was one and a half hour so it was in the central hub of Europe pretty much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tyes, my at my schoo…l I mean my time being in Austria was finished in May 2008. That was for one year. So, May 2008 I packed my luggage and I had to come back to Turkey. I had a Diploma ceremony for my undergrad so that was… I was busy with all summer regarding this and then also I planned ahead that I needed I needed to apply for certain programs in Canada and Australia as well. So, I decided mostly the Canada as I explained to you earlier and then application process started. And then, sorry, my application process started in my second term when I was in Austria. And then, I applied for. For the program, I got a approval from the program from graduate college International Business diploma program. So, then that was three, four months period that I applied for visa for Canada. I prepared my documentation. And as you can imagine all that preparation to go to a new country like your health insurance or travel insurance and all that. So, then it was 24th August in 2009, and I travelled to Canada, Dallas for educational purposes. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay, so let's know let's talk about your professional background. What's your\n",
      "\n",
      "professional background? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tMy professional background, I studied international relations. So, some people think that it's a profession, but an academic field shouldn't be a profession. It's a, it's a different aspect. But in Turkey, the understanding of academics is totally different. They treat the academic programs as a college program, but that's why that's one of the missing parts, my personal opinion that in Turkey, there are some college programs existing but it's not that sufficient or it's not utilize it utilizing it in a good way. That's different topic but to answer your question, yes, I graduated from international relations program, which was in back home in Turkey. But during this summer times, I actually worked in, I wouldn't say work but internships mostly in some firms that was one of them was Hamza bus manufacturing company. I was in their Import Export department because the International Relations graduates in Turkey, they are mostly people, the understanding of this program, when you're working in the field, the field should be in the big companies for corporate environment in their Import/Export department. First of all, they are expecting the fact that your language level I mean, the foreign language, or let's say English, German or Italian, Spanish, whatever that the language that you have. So, they're assuming that you can manoeuvre that process more smoother compared to other administrators. So, we're basically administrator but more and more in a structured format because you have to know the export policy, import policy, and all that. So that was a dimension, but I just wanted to double it also the mandatory on the school that you needed to have that internship during that time frame. So other than that, I didn't have any work experience. So, when I came to Canada, that was my first work experience and that was abroad. So that was the interesting part.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOh, and what was the first work experience? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tFirst work experience I, I mentioned to you earlier that I didn't have a chance to work that much at the regular college, during my studies. So that was a point that because of the financial difficulties, I had to find a job and I was working at the Indian restaurant. Yes, it was mostly serving position. And my school was typically ending at 4pm - Everyday Monday to Friday.. it's full time college program. So, as you can imagine, it's not like undergrad or something. So, 4-6, I had two hours difference and I was evaluating this time mostly either feeding myself or reading some materials and then going to the restaurant my shift was starting 6. It was ending at 2am. So that was four hours. But not every day though. I would say the hours were between 20 to 25 hours. And sometimes this restaurant was catering to the to the weddings. So, first time, I had a chance to see some Indian weddings, some Pakistani weddings, so that was fun. That was my first, but it wasn't full time. It was part time. And as you can imagine, as a student, the best way to find employment is hospitality - food and beverage. So, then the first full time experience was again hospitality. That was a Tim Hortons. But again, part of that was, so after my graduation, the process is in Canada, you have to apply for postgraduate work permit. I'm not sure they change that or not, I didn't have a chance to analyse the policy how it looks like but so I applied for this postgraduate work permit, but at that time, the ideal way of getting the Canadian permanent residency. So that was the provincial nomination program (PNP). Okay, so here's the thin line. So I wanted to get the Canadian work experience, but I heard from so many people that if you have just solo work permit, to find a job is really hard, or you can find some certain jobs, but that's not going to be as satisfactory because employers - their perspective is typically you have a work permit, there's a validity for it. So, how can we rely on your work for immigration and afterwards but if Canadian government or Immigration Canada wouldn't like you to continue with you in terms of the immigration process, so this kind of jeopardize situation for employers and also jeopardizing the employees as well. So that's why I was in between to apply the PR or not. So then I decided to move forward to be part of this PR  program, because I wanted to get the work experience here and my program itself after I joined the program, I realized that it's, there's a core program that I also joined core program, I forgot to mention, that was not paid. That was an internship as well. So, my goal again, I was still sticking with the same goal or You got your education in a different country, and you got the North American aspect. And then you can add an additional work experience to real life work experience, and then you can go back home. But again, during this time, it was so tough to find a job that compliments my, my fields like international business and international relations as well. Part of it is education. Credentials back home is not recognized by the employers. It's recognized if it's in English in Canada, that's why they accept you for the next step to be as an international student, as obvious. But - employers they typically rely on your Canadian experience either or the Canadian educational experience. So, and also consider the fact that we look at comparing two cities like Toronto or Vancouver, the job opportunities are really rare. Maybe if I would be in in Toronto or Vancouver, maybe chances would be better. But, again, I was in a position that maybe if I could get my permanent residency, then I will get the real Canadian work experience. So I was in Winnipeg. So that makes it more interesting. So during this time period, either like, okay, so you get your PR, and then you can get the ‘real’ job, but you get the PR, the PNP program. It's a bit complicated. I'm not sure if it makes sense yet. Yeah. So the permission moment of programming still continues right now, but I'm not sure how efficient it is. So, it requires that first of all, you get a job letter from a certain employer. That's not necessarily relevant. Doesn't have to be relevant to your background. But any kind of institution any kind of Corporation, Tim Hortons or Starbucks, or a catering company, any kind of field sector …needs to be full-time. So this job letter and and some other documents that you provide to provincial government and the provincial government may or may not they give you a certain credential that okay you're approved for the nominate program and the next step is to apply for the federal program which is the permanent residency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tNot Express entry, it’s the PNP. I'm not sure that it was existing at that moment. I don't want to mislead your research, but it's definitely it's definitely worth to take a look at it because we are talking about here 2011 that I applied. Sorry, that's correct. So 2011, it's worth to take a look, if there's express entry in Canada.. So during this time, I was working at Tim Hortons, but also, I was an entry level. So if I was a storefront, they name it. But also it was the suggestion of the employer that you were suggesting me if we will put you on a spot to be in the management. So, your approval from the federal would be more easier. Because you'll look like you're more skilled and it could correlate, or it could it would complement your international business diploma because you're somewhat doing the business management. Yes. So that made sense for me. And it put me in the management program, and I've worked there for entirely three years. And because the process takes took three years, and unfortunately, during this process, you're not, you don't have a chance to change your job. So that was the, that was the process. And even I got some job offers during this time, but, but I couldn't I couldn't change it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tUm, in terms of moving to Canada, I know that you discussed it, but like, how long did you prepare for it? Like, how did you plan? How long did you plan and think about it? How much time like did you spend doing? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tSo I think it was… it also overlaps the idea of ‘going abroad’ and moving to Canada. So specifically, just to answer your question about Canada, I would say six to eight months, but going and living abroad. I wasn't sure I will live entirely all my life. But just to have the taste of that. I think that was always on my mind. Since the elementary, because I always thought that the territories are something that we didn't create. So, I wouldn't I didn't want to limit myself in a certain boundary. I knew that there was always more to explore. Yeah, so that was just my way of understanding, as a word citizen or you can name it in a different way. But Yeah, that was this idea was always there but specifically for Canada I would say six to eight months, but it was mostly the mental preparation for - I mean just googling, doing some research about the climate first thing, and some other things the job opportunities, the culture itself, the education system and so on. Whatever you can imagine, I tried to do the research as much as possible and also the fact that I am as I mentioned to you earlier, the educational consultancy firm, there are also somewhat helpful in terms of mapping it out what would be the ideal Canadian experience - that they were not sufficient in sufficient in terms of how to you know how to prepare fully, because they were get imagination was or the their way of endorsing this imagination was mostly a ‘Canadian dream’. Even though that the process of getting your work permit process of getting a PR from the residency that was totally different than whatever they told me and whatever I experienced here because they were generalizing and putting in a different format for every single person, but they didn't mention about the difficulties or they didn't mention about the cons. So they were, they were mostly focusing on just the business part rather than this person is changing his entire life. They're not talking about the career, we're not talking about life here. So unfortunately, I would say a mental preparation was four to six months and between, I would say the next 2, 3 months it was mostly the documents and preparation, documents preparation, some bureaucratic preparation, but the mental preparation was, I would say four to six months, but the entire preparation process was six to eight months. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo move to Toronto?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tNo, that's another part that it's a complicated part. So, I decided to work in the marketing sector. So, I was really interested in the marketing inside the business spectrum, Business School spectrum. So, I decided to look for certain jobs but then I found a media integrated specialist position, which  was focusing on advertisement and marketing. It was an entry level position. And then I gave my previous knowledge to Tim Hortons. I was assistant manager at that time by the way. And they offered me being a store manager, but I certainly didn't want to move forward with hospitality because it was enough in terms of the difficulties and plus, I wanted to try more. I wanted to get a different insight, a different part of the business. And then I got this job at a different company - this is still in Winnipeg. I dis this job almost six months and then I was doing good in the company. But what happened was, there was a family emergency my mom had a stroke and she had the open-heart surgery. So, then I had to move back. And I had to give my notice of emergency. And they kept my job for a while. But after a certain period of time, of course, I totally understand the fact that they couldn't keep my position. And so that was a time that year.. 2015, February, I decided to move back to Turkey, not permanently, not definitely, maybe indefinitely. So, it was a big question mark. It was just an emergency purpose. And I didn't know, I didn't plan the rest. So that was the heartbreaking point in terms of not having the full taste of Canadian experience at that time. I didn't even know what was gonna be my future. Yeah, at that time. So then we've been 2015 February till 2016 October, I had my Turkish experience, I worked in two different jobs. One was the logistics coordinator in an international firm and the other one was, I was the procurement specialist. So I was mostly working in the agricultural company that they were important to exporting and they were actively participating in the tenders of United Nations and I was also working in the tender department as well. So, it was a well-paid job considering the fact that the standard of living in Turkey and some other factors, but after my mom's health was getting better, I offered my family to move entirely to Canada. I didn't want to limit their time being here because I offered them even six months in and out Not because of the policies or procedures, because I knew that, because of their age because of their cultural background, maybe they wouldn't be a good fit. Or maybe they wouldn't have a taste of Canada. Maybe they wouldn't like to be here. So that's why I suggested be with me six months or four months, whatever. And then you can go back to Turkey, we can maybe get a mortgage here or I can settle here because I definitely, I mean, doing this one and a half year in Turkey, I decided to move to Canada entirely, and I want to settle here. That was that, that tangible and concrete way of thinking that I would settle here. So that was a time, because of the economy, part of it, it's the polarized society. I didn’t want to live in a polarized society. I didn't want to live in a society that that people are judgmental about certain things, and I'm still not sure if running away or leaving the country is a good choice? As an individual, maybe it's a good choice. But if you're thinking more of a, because I love my country, I think that individuals can create certain environment that it would definitely impact your campaigns. But sticking with the subject, yes, that was a time that I decided to move back to Canada and because of the job opportunities, potential job opportunities, I wanted to come to Toronto so year 2016 October, I came to Toronto from Turkey this time \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So first I wanted to continue as a procurement executive because I wanted to see that there's any way of working in that field and plus my, even though I was working in a domestic company in Turkey, but our operational spectrum was International. So, I was hoping the fact that maybe I would get somehow, I would get some opportunity in my field as a procurement executive. But unfortunately, my application process was really heavy. Even when I was applying to certain job boards, like indeed… they were reviewing my resume, but they weren't responding. Because I know the fact that whoever I went to and ask, even the professional HR specialists, they were saying that yes, you have a rich background, we can definitely take advantage of it. But at the same time, you don't have a specific procurement executive experience in Canada. So that's the roadblock. And then I decided to change my way because I needed the financial funds. I started to work, which is entirely different field, as a construction worker. I worked in construction for six months. I needed just cash to get to the next level. And I was offered by my employer that would you like to be an installer and the money is really is really good. It's a lucrative business. You need to work with your hands but at the same time with pays off. I said, my goal driven, I'm a goal driven person, but not the money driven person. Money is a tool should stay as a tool. But there should be more than that so I said no. And meanwhile, I was looking for some job opportunities. And I took an opportunity of being an account executive in a software as a service SaaS company. So, we were building platforms like coding platforms, yeah, JavaScript and then some other programming languages that we were using. So, it was fun because I was dealing with the schools directly. I was managing the account and as well as I had the program coordinator that she was helping me out, how to coordinate after the sales process. And I learned a lot I learned the structure of not the post secondary or for the university level institutions, but high schools, primary schools and JK to 12. I had a chance to having an experience of the structure is, so it was it was eye-opening. And then I decided to work for, because I needed the money because my initial goal together to get my master's degree in something that, what I am pursuing right now, immigration, settlement, similar approaches, which would be ideally multidisciplinary. And in this case, I can take my international relations, political science background and I would enrich it with the different aspects such as sociology or anthropology, which as you know, it's not enriched in international relations program. There are some courses but the courses are mostly just intro to Sociology and intro to anthropology or so on. So that's why I needed some funds and I got a good offer from a financial institution that as a credit counsellor. So it was also helpful for you to understand what the society's is going through right now in terms of debt. Debt is one of the biggest thing and in Canada, I think the overall lean on the word worldwide, right? So I worked there for for two years, and I saved my money for my tuition and luckily, I got the scholarship as well and I put this money on the side. So, in this case that I don't I didn't need to hustle that much and work doing my studies. So right now, I'm not working. But if you're asking me in general what I graduated from, did it entirely compliment my experiences? I don't think so. Because of the circumstances because of the the job availability itself, and because of also the other the reason I think personally about I experienced is the need to make money, we need to survive. So that pushes you in certain fields that maybe you're not going to be engaging. Maybe you'll know that first place when you read the job description, but at the end of the day, you have to bring the food on the table. So that that was the main reason that why I kind of switched from one sector to another sector, but it was all complimenting the business, which I took my business management, administrative skills to jobs, and sales. I think sales is a different ballgame. It's you can either learn, and it's not something that you can entirely learn. You should have some sort of sales skills in you, but at the same time, you can enrich it. So, it was helpful, but at the same time, I've mostly enjoyed my role when I was not selling the educational coding platform, but I was actually giving some presenting my consultation, like counselling sessions to the people that who are in that. So, to see that how people are desperate, lack of educational background for lack of skills that there is a lack of financial literacy too, which is not getting taught in the primary school or high school. So, it was an eye opener. It was a it is a life experience rather than that work experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tYeah. So I mean, I think you've answered a lot of this question already. Okay, about about your skills or how do your skills fit in the skilled migration program.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tSure, that's a good question. I think I have Okay, this is a I want to start from this story… When I was seven, eight years old. I saw footage on the TV. That that was. That was a topic that some anchor-man they were discussing about what's happening in Bosnia war. So, I was seeing a truck that it was saying UN - the United Nations. I didn't know what it stands for. So, I was asking my parents, they didn't speak English, of course, they didn't know. And they figured out that they probably bring some food. And that says Un in Turkish Un, it's a flower. Yeah. So they kind of correlated to that. I said Wow, that's nice. What are they doing? They said ‘Oh, they're helping people that were actually suffering from war. So then I started with dig deep about UNICEF. What they are doing, I didn't have any knowledge now reach like 10-11 years old. I told my parents that I want to work for UNICEF. I want to help children, I want to, I want to be part of the community that whoever is suffering from war from certain difficulties. I want to be helpful because if I'm not going to be helpful, what is the purpose of my entity in this world, my existence in this world, that's a different way. We can discuss later What is the purpose of being present in this world. That's a different topic, but I wanted this and funny enough, I chose international relations and then I was more involved in certain cases, theories, how it was helpful, or it wasn't helpful to interpret certain situations. And then I found myself in this job, In business kind of field, which I don't like because there's no human touch, in my opinion, I think. You can, you can actually covered it, or spice it up with a more humane touch. It is totally up to you. We don't need to, I don't need to put it as an excuse. But I think how I can bring my economic experience and my undergrad experience with the business. First of all, I have a, I have a theory I have the idea of major research paper. So, which I'm thinking about how the business class immigrants, they switch from business class to different streams. Either being an entrepreneur in the entrepreneurship program in Canada, or they go different streamlines because they don't have the channel that they can actually continue in that channel. And actually apply their, their experiences, right? So, I'm thinking about doing a research about their experiences, their difficulties, specific before that was, and also what are the challenges and how to overcome it. That was my idea. But once I'm getting into more and the program, I'm seeing and getting influenced by different kinds of ideas, ideas that are right now, so I might not stick with that idea in terms of my major research paper, but just to answer your question more clear. I think with my, with my business skills, I will I wouldn't just name it just administrative and also some marketing skills, but you can just put a bit from here and there and kind of make it a big, big impact on your future skills. But again, it's so limitable. It's not that why I mostly feeding myself from my international relations background and my interest in that field, even in the in the class discussions, I'm seeing myself more confident, not because of my business background, but because of my international relations background. So what I want to do with this field, unfortunately, I can put my business skills, mostly maybe into the presentations because I learned a lot in the program, or my, my dialogue skills or maybe administrative format, when I'm preparing or writing a paper because in the undergrad level, you have some short term limits that you can go beyond, but International Business program it gave me an understanding….I was involved in so many different marketing research projects. So that gave me an understanding of how to do research. How you can excel to a point that you can be successful in your future endeavours. So I think that could be helpful in that sense. But compared to my undergrad and business, post-secondary degree, the book will be helpful but in different ways, it's hard to tell how it's going to help me. It is more hybrid. That's, that's good way of explaining that. So, but in future, I would like to work in an NGO, or I would like to stay in academics, if that will be able to position, if there will be any sort of day. I know, it's really challenging, and it demands so much from an individual. I would love to do that either stay in academics or working for an NGO. In this case. I don't want to actually be in specifically Canadian settlements, sector. I don't want to just file the papers and just check the policies. I think that I, I can do more. The more is? It's a good question. It is it is really. I mean, I think certain things, for example, helping someone's paperwork in the settlement sector, or trying to figure out what's the what's missing policy in here, or what kind of policies we can implement in this case? That's totally valuable. I understand. But yeah, I'm not trying to degrade the value of it. I totally respect that. But at the same time, if I can stay in academics, I can try to see what are the missing parts in the policies\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo do you see any missing parts in policy now?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tNow … temporary foreign workers. Yeah, it's a big time. I mean, I was reading an article referring. She She has a Filipino background. And she was focusing on the temporary foreign worker program and how Filipino migrants actually suffered from it. She had a focus group and everything. So, first of all, it's good to start this four years in, and four years out policy. It was it was totally endorsing the fact that there's a Canadian dream, come here, work for four years, but at the same time, that the officials they were doing numerous trips, from Alberta, Saskatchewan from different provinces, Manitoba as well, that they didn't actually fully explain in the thesis. That's what it says. They didn't fully explain what the pros and cons are, they were mostly talking about pros like a salesperson. I mean, we need to explain that first. So four years in four years out policy is once you are accepted as temporary foreign worker. So, the policy was, I'm not sure if it still continues the same way. I think government, Immigration Canada was trying to do some adjustments or they were discussing about that, I'm not sure if it's an act right now or if it's a policy change on the table. But once you're in the four years, you allowed to work 4 years and after your for your duration is expire, then you have to leave the country. That's what the program says, but what actually this program led these workers because they created an environment here they created a belonging here. So they want to find a way to apply for for permanent residency. So, at that time PNP program was a good way of finding that channel. Mostly It started with the seasonal workers. So speaking of skilled classification, yeah. That definitely is related with this temporary foreign workers. So, they are typically mostly the temporary foreign workers, they were low skilled. And most of them, they wanted to stay in Canada. So, they either went for PNP, or they were looking for a sponsorship. But the sponsorship as you can imagine, directly from an employer, it was so rare. But mostly it was the PNP programs that they were finding a way to get their permanent residency.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo, sort of a Alright, so let's also talk about your family. So you losing your family and what was their role in your migration?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tSure. So my parents are still alive and Scott, and I have an older sister. So she is 16 years older than me. So I'm 33 years old now. So she's almost 50 I guess, 48. She had no influence or no endorsement in my immigration, migration process. But mostly, my father was a pro. My mom was against.. She was looking at the things more in a sentimental way. And I totally feel for her. And it is a tough decision to leave the country, to leave your family. But my father, he was looking at things more pragmatic way, because he saw that in me that this is what I wanted to be and I would be unhappy to live in the country, live in Turkey. Because of so many reasons, as I explained to you the polarized way of society and the economic situation, yes, I would probably. I'm just imagining myself what would happen if I wouldnt come to Canada Do you think that would be a good way of explaining? I will probably get married in my early 20s. And I would have children right now because of the societal pressure, time pressure, family pressure? It is still there. When we are skyping, they still endorsing the idea of like, when are you getting a married? When are we going to have the children on our hands?, and I'm just saying that I have goals once I finish these goals, and then when they accomplished then my first of all, is not going to just get married -  to find the right person. Marriage is just a paper. The system certificate, interestingly a certificate so accomplishing something of some sort. They do they certify you. So I just don't understand this notion. I never understood. So they are more conservative in terms of the traditional way of living, or being an individual. But I'm not entirely thinking the opposite, though. But most of the things that we don't agree, but I think, in family if you find the right way of putting the dialogue, I think they're going to understand you don't need to fight they don't need to. You need to just empathise yourself. Empathy is the key. So then that works. They don't understand me sometimes. I didn't understand them, but I'm trying and then they started to try my position. So, once I'm explaining what I'm going through and what I went through as I explained everything all the immigration process. Now they value it, and they justify it, my situation that why I'm not rushing, or quitting a job. Yeah. But yes, mostly father was abroad during this immigration process. Mom was against and and the sister was neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAlright, so we can now I think move to the mapping. So, in your case, I think I want to I want to know about all of the visas that you went on in your study abroad, work abroad. experiences. So mostly, that would be for Austria and Canada. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tCan I map it out in terms of the emotions as well?  Can I draw two tables which was Austria and Canada? Okay, let's put this…So the first one I'm putting as figure one, which is going to be the Austria visa process because there was only one visa, so there's no need to explain other which is simple. Figure two is going to be a little bit complicated. I would like to start with Austrian one because the experience was. So, I think in every single, I mean mostly the westernized countries, their requirements are so detailed. So, I would say this is I would say, stress level. The most two things that I would name is during these visa processes, one is the stress level in terms of emotion. And one is that the work that you put, so I would say the efforts/time. It's gonna go the same way I guess okay so the stress level was not too much because it was educational purpose. I knew that it was going to end really, really soon but the effort and time, European Schengen visa is really demanding, but the stress level Let's just say one to 10 – I would put 4. Stress 4, effort 9. So again 1-10. I would just kinda put here in detail - Study permit. Okay in this case let's put it this way. So Schengen visa process, let's say study permit. So study permit was again one to 10 I would say, because, okay, this is kind of different. The stress level was a little bit less again. I would put 2. OK, because, so the paperwork process for Austria was handled by myself, but the paperwork process in Canada, was handled by that consultancy agency. So, and they're actually they helped me out a lot with that, of course I paid to him. So that's why I knew that they guaranteed the approval is going to be there, you're I mean, you're eligible for so many things, so everything will be fine. So that's why the stress level was not that much, and effort was not that much. So, I would put 4 and 2. Just gathering the documents was a bit tough. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But the PR and immigration is different. So I'm going to draw two figures. One is gonna be the provincial Nominee Program. The other one will be PR process and the last one will be the citizenship application so there will be three graphs. sorry I just couldn't organize on my mind. So this figure, figure 2a, figure 2b, and figure 2c. I mean, it might not be the right category, but I'm just trying to kind of sub categorize. Okay, so let's start with the figure a. which will be the regular work permit/pep. So, again, one to 10 scale. This was stressful. This was this was I would say 8 because the program wasn't explained enough. Even though there were some provincial, like Manitoba start up. Yeah. I'm not sure if you heard of them. They're actually a non-profit organization funded by government. They're explaining. They're providing some sort of consultancy to the people that who are going through this process. So the people over there, the agents over there, they were so helpful. It was good. I mean, I have to justify this of course… but but in general still there were so many unknowns. So, I would say the stress level for the PNP program because it's just the first step, but you don't know what's going to happen afterwards. And the effort and time, I think this will kind of never change because effort and time exceptt this part. This part I'm gonna explain to you the citizenship part, it will always be the same. I would say let's say 9. So this was because there was more document requirements and job another, job offer letter from the employer and explaining this process to the employer. They were even though they were familiar, they were a bit hesitant about certain things, and you had to be nice with them. So other part is you need some documents from Turkey, the official documents and you cannot be scanned. So, you need origin documents. And plus, you need to provide certain documents in different categories. So that was a bunch of different combinations. So, effort and time, and yeah, it was 9. So, the second one, I mean, as a lot of subcategories. I can talk about the PR, which is not the main goal, but the main goal is this, but this is the segue as you know. So we're going to use a different color. So, one to 10 scale again. Yeah, stress level we categorize we don't change the category. I had some some documents already get prepped before, you you would use some documents that are already in the database in this process. You don't need to get everything from scratch but at the same time, the form itself, the application form itself is so detailed compared to the PNP program, or the work permit. So I would say, effort and time goes hand in hand. But in terms of not to gather the documents that much, but to be more cautious about how to fill out the form. Again, I needed some sort of support and I got that support from Manitoba start-up program. Okay. That was helpful in terms of their guidance. They didn't feel the forum behalf of me, but they gave me certain guidance. So I would say interesting way, maybe seven, for for the effort of time, but the stress level was, was more I would say… I don't want to say 10 because it's not a life and death situation. I always knew that I had another option. Worst case scenario, I would go back home. I would find different ways. Different ways mean… just want to open that. People think about different ways as shortcut fails, like getting married with someone or different kinds of opportunities. But I had that opportunity in my previous relationship that she offered me straight – you dont need to go through this process. I refuse. I refuse it because I don't want to rely on someone's bill to you know, I don't want to jeopardize the situation. What if you wouldn't get along at certain periods?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "M:\tHow long will you meet with this person?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tShe offered like I was overall three and a half years, almost four years. But she offered me in the middle of this time frame. I mean, two years. When we were two years together, she offered me she said, You don't need to go through this process. You can just handle everything more smoothly. But I refuse. I refuse that. Again, this is this is really complicated because if you really don't feel that this is the right thing, because some people, they just rely on this, and I didn't want to do that. It wasn't voluntarily some people just, you know, offer some sort of money or internal arrangement. They call it fake marriage, but it wasn't fake. It was real that at the end proves that we are not together anymore. So, I was right. I was right. Okay, so seven, stress level was nine. And the last one will be the citizenship. Yes, I already applied for my citizenship. I pass the knowledge test, I'm just expecting the oath, the ceremony. So, the time that I pass the knowledge test, it was 29 April this year. So, they literally talked to me about the timeframe between six to six months, six months to One year. So, we will see how that goes. It's already five months past, I have no rush. I think the stress level is really low because after this process, it lowers. Its smooth. So, I would say to and the effort again, I got, I was busy at that time, and I got some help from an immigration agency that they prepare those documents. So, I would say after that time, maybe 4, so two and four.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess I already passed the certain stages. And according to my immigration consultant, she said that if you pass the knowledge test, and if you provided certain documents and all about, it's all about just waiting for them to call you for the oath, and the ceremony, and then you will be officially getting the certificate of citizenship, so it's not 100% because it's not official, but it's on the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I lived in Turkey for one and a half years, the certain requirement is, as you might know, after you get your PR For the next five years, you have to be present in the country for at least three years. So, I had to fulfil my gap for the application process to be eligible for citizenship application. So that's the gap. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAll right. Now we're gonna move on to the next question. So commercial services. So in all of these processes, what are the commercial services that you used? You know, things that you paid for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tSo commercial services - so only two of them so the one for Austrian visa - I paid for it, the Schengen visa/ study permit - that all is the same. I paid yeah the agent. Yeah, yeah. So that was paid to a consultancy agent - that they had the firm. The second one was I mostly use it, as shared with you, that was the not for profit, it was funded by government. So I never got into any IELTS or TOEFL process because first of all my back home with the education was 70% English so let's put it this way - so during my application to the college they recognize that I don't need to provide any IELTS in Canada. So I never got any IELTS or any TOEFL. I found the way. So other than that when it came to applying for citizenship they they were asking basically the requirement is but also what complimented my post secondary, that the regular college, because if you have the post-secondary diploma It shows the certain benchmark, and you're not going to get the test English test required.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So visa fees, I paid it by myself for the Canadian citizenship one. But for the Austrian one, it was help from the parents. So yes, it was paid by the people that I have the relationship with. All the fees of course and I paid for it. So the Austrian one was paid for by my family. It was supported by my family but the rest it was paid by my own financial funds. I covered everything. So yes, I’m going to include that one too. The insurance for sure. So, other than that, as you mentioned the translation services - that was a big thing that I paid for. So, I pretty much paid except the citizenship one, I pretty much paid for all those documents the entire process each time. Okay, let's let's be clear. I'm just trying to refresh my memory so not each time. So, only one time for the for the translation services because I had already got documents that I translated. and not for the police clearance because you need to always renew it has to be updated version as you might know. But the rest like let's say, the translation of diploma or certain things. I had it only once and I kept the record of it as a scan version because I knew that the application process was going to be held online. So that's why it was easier. I didn't have to pay each time. But it is kind of complicated because I set the police clearance and the police clearance from Turkey. You don't pay for it. It's a free service. Like everybody has a right to get that documents without any problem. But just because it needs to be updated. So, you have to literally translate it and get that done all the time. So that's why it was the most challenging part. It was all in Turkey. Diploma, criminal record check, what else? - birth certificate, and of course ID, and pretty much it. So for Austria I would say all. For, Canadian citizenship, just because I had already diploma, translation as well as birth certificate and Id, already so I only needed the police certificate. So for the first work permit – it was pretty much everything. By the way, if it might be more that I'm gonna go home and just check it out. I can add more. PR process – so I think, of course CR (criminal record), I already had preparation for from my previous work premise application so that complemented most of it. So, the health insurance for Canadian citizenship, there's no health insurance needed. Work permit – its hard to think. We forgot the study permit – of course this was a consultancy as well, which is the most important. So study permit. I think I have the tendency to forget that maybe that time. Let's put a note here that I said this one okay, let's put it this way all of the translation services were provided by Turkish origin services or companies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Insurance was a Canadian company called CR something. Document translation was provided by Turkish councillor. Why don't the reason that why I need the Turkish origin any documents from originally from Turkey, that translation Part too because since I was living in Winnipeg, they don’t have a consulate there. The consulate is in Toronto so I took advantage of that in my citizenship application. \n",

      "Mi:\tHeavily heavily… and I know mom praise Steve Jobs,Bill Gates a lot… because the communication tools are there. But apart from that I actually use technology for my research or to seek certain things even in the city - what kind of gigs what kind of events, even during my time being in Canada too so yes. So maybe you can categorize it and…Connection is one thing. You use technology, mostly, heavily right? So, communication. So, this graph is going to be the first one and use of technology category. So, the first one we will do is the communication. So in communication is I would say mostly I was communicating with, of course, friends and family. So I don't have that much connectivity with their relatives so I would just use categorize them. So, one to 10 scale - So mostly friends were four or five. Lets say four. And family was nine.\n",

      "Mi:\tIt was mostly at that time Skype. Skype is the tool. Yeah, we're not talking about right now we're talking about the most used one is Skype, okay? Because there was no tools whatsapp, viber, no smartphones. Smartphones were there, but this is the beginning, he parents were not able to utilize. This we will call research again specifically for gigs, some events, conferences, which is rare and but it happens if it interests me and then… so research. So, I would say let's categorize this on to So, okay. One is as the Google using as a tool and one is the email endorsement. So it's about, let's say platforms. So, which means sometimes there were some common platforms that people were sharing ideas, gigs and all that. And you already subscribed into it, and then you automatically get email subscriptions, and some weekly newsletters. And one is like, just randomly searching. what's what's going on in the city. So, I would say equal measures. I would say 6 and 6. And the reason that I'm saying Six not because of it doesn't represent the interest level of using the technology but also represents that this may be the rest of 4 that we didn't include, it was endorsed by friends or word of mouth. So, I didn't need to use technology haven't had that much because Winnipeg is a small town. I started to use technology more when I was in Toronto. So word of mouth, it really works in terms of like, how you accommodate yourself in the Winnipeg lifestyle. Because mostly the school platform, I don’t remember the name exactly, but it was school graduates or alumni. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think we should include that one as well, to migration purpose. It was mostly the government website. Again, this is the one that you can rely on. Yeah. And also just because I was using the PNP program, they had their own website and plus Manitoba start-up. They’re helping after you know during your time being there like in terms of resume building, job seeking. Typically they tried to help you out of the jobs of how you can integrate after your residency and after your integration process. Settlement support. So they had their own website, they were also sharing some events in terms of job seeking, or there's a job fair that you guys should come over and for. There's a conference, information session about some policy changes. I was happy with their service. I saw definitely a compliment.\n",

Okay, so let's put it this way then. So 2016-present - it was the citizenship process so I already had PR. So let's say PR attained in 2013. So, and then two years, I held a PR in Winnipeg. And then in the present, Toronto. 2015 Apr-2016 Oct I was in Turkey. I can just name it as the transition period from Winnipeg – Turkey – Toronto. \n",

      "Mi:\tI can recall that so you read my mind. So, my my ex partner, she was really helpful mentally. And she was born and raised in Canada, but she put so much effort in to understand what I'm going through. She was always there when I had those stressful times. She was trying to give me that comfort zone by activities, by trying to help me to engage with the environment because I guess this emotional connectivity she wanted me to stay there. So, she didn't want me to leave. That's why I've actually made community like, she didn't want me to leave. And also that's why she wanted me to. She offered that getting Let's get married. And let's go through the citizenship process more, more smooth. But because I had the the military service obligation at that time, back in Turkey - I didn't obey that, by the way. So, we didn't need to, we don't need to add it into the map. So I paid 6000 American dollar at that time, and just to waive it. So, in this case, I would be exempt from military service. So that was one question on my mind and plus Winnipeg itself. If I would like to have a Canadian experience, I didn't want to settle in Winnipeg specifically for my entire life. But at that time, she was showing the signals that…the family was there part of her family. And have she had a secure job. And she wanted to. She wanted me to stay. And she was thinking that Winnipeg would be the place to settle. But I wasn't agreeing on that term. And but regardless, she was really helpful I could her. I would name my father that - he was so supportive. And also, I would mean a close friend that became to Canada together. He was… just because he was in the process. He was so helpful, when the times that I was hesitant about if I would actually put my energy to stay in this country, or I would maybe go back. So, he was kinda lifting me up. So that was so helpful. So would name three people and I guess you're asking it to map it out there. Let's use a different model. I would but with all due respect to my father, he was not there with me physically. So physical connectivity is important, I would put first. I can name her. Well there you go. Ex-partner. The second person would be my father even though he was not there physically but mentally he was day to day, sending messages asking me how am I doing it?, if I need something. So he was there. He was there. And, I can name it as best friend. He moved to Saskatchewan. He's actually he wants to bring his, his brother for his master's. So I think I can name some people in terms of personalities, but also Manitoba start-up. There were two agents there. They were so helpful. They were so caring. They were easily empathising with your situation. And I think their psychology background is so strong that personally I'm not sure. That's what my observation is because they will easily empathise, they weren't looking at you as a case or as a client or just a, just a person. They really can do that. You are a person that trying to find a way to robust your situation here without suffering. So, they were definitely helpful. Yeah, they were so explanatory in terms of the process in terms of even the single boxes in the form that… what to write, what not to write, the due dates, they were so cautious before. So hopefully they are in a good position or not even maybe in the same organization. So 2 agents, I would say.\n",

      "Mi:\tSo, of course the work permit and PNP part. This is the first one.  I'm mixing the colors because just to be just a little more visible. This is the second. This is third. This is 4th. This is for because that's the last stage. I had not much doubt about certain things and I wouldn't want to include Austria because that was a different kind of category. So, for this one [work permit] the most challenging one was uncertainty, the Psychological part, whether you will get it or not. So heres the same [PR], I would say, the psychological factor whether you'll be able to obtain this is the PR or your status or not. So, the PNP and as well as the PR process, it is so connected, interconnected. So, it is hard to, to differentiate from one to each other in terms of psychological. You still feel the stress level. Here just basically you’re in a situation that is your fingers are crossed and you’re just waiting. Can I just make a correction? T his is 2011.  So, the process was, I mean, the PR process was not that long, because each province has different responses. If you're in Ontario, at that time, the process took longer. But in promises like my intro by Saskatchewan, I think the number of applicants, one of the main reasons, is more low compared to the Ontario or bigger provinces as BC. But I think it took two years, two and a half years after I applied for PR. I was on work permit and I had to work in the same employer, even though I got some opportunity to explain that to you. So that was the painful part. In daily basis, let's say you have the moments that you really don't think that this job is not a good fit for you and you have an alternative, but you cant evaluate that alternative because of your complicated situation, status situation. So that was really difficult. And this one was just that just the duration because I think lately what I heard the processing times are getting longer and longer. Yeah, even the Canadian citizenship. So I would just say I think that the duration of the process. This one is more more psychological rather than psychological. It's more….it is kind of psychological but it is more of a, because the cultural fit is gonna to be there or not?. So I would say unknown or uncertainty. Sure, cultural connectivity? I don't know if I just put it in the right way, but yes, there's the uncertainty of cultural connectivity. So, Which means will you have a culture shock? Or Is it the right decision? What is expected of me? What kind of difficulties I will face? It is kind of routing to cultural connectivity still. Let's say it my first year in Canada. So that's going to give you an idea. Yeah. So, I'm gonna put it in the behind, okay. First one year. So, again, we're going to rely on our fancy graphs. This is let's say, time. For the sake of me just try to figure it out because I need time and satisfaction? slash engagement. So, of course the first six months, there's a rapid increase because everything is new, you wanna explore everything. You're not getting homesick. From zero all the way up. Even though I was new, the climate was challenging, but everything was new and I'm a person - If I fail or if I just don't let certain things. I'm not a person that I used to blame myself about my choices, but I don't do that anymore. Because you never know without trying. But after six months there’s a dip. You start to feel homesick, criticism on certain things which is comparing traditions. I put criticism here because it might be sometimes rough, especially in my age at that time, It was hard for me - rather than accepting I was criticizing, And it turned to a comparison. Like why! I was criticizing mostly the lifestyle because in Turkey our lifestyle is more laid back. Not into this is a modern capitalist way of melting our lives in. For example, first time in my life I saw a drive through. I had never seen a drive through. Just sit down - you enjoy your meal you have a nice conversation you take you take your time and you actually give the value to the food. Again this is just the the comparison, the personal comparison for the food – the food itself, and the food culture and how do you value the food. And the advantage part of Toronto, which I didn't have the advantage that much in Winnipeg, like, there are tons of different restaurants that represents different cultures, different cuisines. And then questioning, pros and cons of staying. And then it stopped. The reason that it stopped and it's a more stable line, because first of all, you're making a decision. This time, and also it doesn't the decision that you make it is not helping you to increase the satisfaction level but at the same time you're accepting the situation. It's more like an acceptance rather than making plans. So the program itself that the PNP or other programs, it's not a satisfactory and you know the pros and cons pretty much by reading it, by hearing from other people's experiences, how it takes such a long time to invitation and all that. But by accepting the fact that if you really want to stay, and this is the route, take it or leave it. So that's why you somewhat, your plans are becoming more concrete but at the same time, it is helping you to go up or down, it is more like stable. So I think the first year is really important. That's why I just wanted to evaluate this year. And plus, it's easy to remember. That's why I don't want to go further about  second, third etc.. But I think this will be helpful to understand my first year experience.\n",

      "M:\tI suppose the final set of things that I want to ask you about generally broadly and maybe part of your mouth This is just questions. Have you provided migration advice to anybody? migration? What advice do you provide migration advice to people if they ask you? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tI do. I do. I had, especially after 2015 coup attempts in Turkey. Turkey is highly polarized. And the young professionals I mean, young professional friends, that which they have skills. I wouldn't want to name it low skilled\\high skilled school because that's the comparison what Canada does but I would say skilled. I value all the workers in a different sense. As you can imagine, that's I just done different kinds of jobs within sectors. There's no low skills or high skills. They are just skills. You just have the skills and you can reflect it to certain things. So, my friends were asking about what are the pros and cons of the immigration to Canada? So, my answer was, I kind of wanted to get away from giving a solid answer. I don't want to mislead people. But one thing that I was just sure making them understand the situation and then the process. I said the first thing, it's not easy. It will never be easy in the in the short run, and hopefully things will change in the long run, but and I said, Okay, depending on their age, I was asking them you need to sacrifice certain things and these things are family, these things are the job that you might not integrate your skills very well. And you have to maybe work, you might have to work in different kind of sector, different kind of jobs. And you might have to get used to a different culture, the food itself, not just the food, even the communication level of people. And something that you get used to that back home that maybe it's intimate, maybe that will be offensive to different business. So, you might have to get yourself into certain situations that, it's a huge sacrifice. And you only live once. If you're looking from this perspective, is that worth it? I mean, you have to just ask yourself this question, instead of asking me that, is that worth it? So these are the things these are the tools that I'm giving it to you. If you're asking details, I can provide you the details and I can give you the certain links that you can use search for your research. But yeah, I rather just reflect the question back. These are the things that you should expect if you come here, give or take. So, are you ready? Are you ready to sacrifice?. And then their enthusiasm level is going down and they're like, okay, I better maybe dig deep and take a look at it. And I'll get back to you if I need some sort of advice from you. And they typically don't get back to me. I'm not sure if I do the right thing or wrong thing, but I just want people to understand that this is not something like you’re ready for a backpacking trip. And you should understand that once they come here, they come here with certain burdens, financial burden on their shoulder, maybe they sell their car, their house, it's a big change. So, who am I to actually tell people that, yeah, you should come to Canada, you're going to be wealthy or rich, Canada is waiting for you. No, they need to be aware. So that's why I'm being so cautious when I'm giving them direction. I wouldn't call it giving them direction, I would call them just putting everything on one basket and making sure that the knowledge basket is full and they're picking the one that they need. So, I don't want to give the wrong direction. Because there's no wrong or right direction. It's everybody's own direction. So that's why I'm being really careful. But answering your question. Yes, time to time and they're asking me those questions. For education, it's a different aspect. I definitely endorse the education. I'm just telling them, look either for or learning a new language or if you want to get the post-secondary. If you want to get the post graduate experience, it's worth it. It's worth it. Because of these these reasons, yeah. But if you're just purely about to come to Canada, just for immigrating or settling, it's not easy. It's a long process. So, take the baby steps and think about it. \n",

      "Mi:\tOne thing that I really like to do is when you are so connected with the work environment in Canada and you just have some other priorities to settle and earn, you let go of certain things like traveling, or participating in certain things because it all comes with the certain financial requirements, right?. So, first of all I want to value give the value to it. I want to enjoy what's actually in Canada. That's one part and… but before that I want to finish my, my school. I want to get my degree and I would like to concentrate on how I can fit myself into either academic environment. Or, as I told you working in a meaningful NGO that I can actually put my skills, learn more, gain more, give more. So that's my goal. Specifically, for Canada. Yes, I would like to live in this country. This country is great. I mean, but the experiences are great because we cannot blame either people or culture or physical things. The system has so many missing points. We all agree with it and officials agree with it especially after post 911 they increase securitization and migration regimes, border regimes and everything. It got to a point that stereotyping is so easy, visualization so easy. Unfortunately, as we talked before, taking part in, in in certain environments is not that easy, because there are certain barriers, especially workplaces diversity wise. Yes, yet, compared to other countries Canada is well diverse, but we have to actually fulfil this diversity as we talked before, so that's why I just really want to want to be …want to access certain things that I can fulfil my desires. At the same time I would like to have a good network in here that, which I've already started and I'm building that out which is good to take it to the next level but I cant just commit myself either living in Canada entire my life for going back to Turkey. I cant commit to this because you never know. You never know but I certainly think that there are so many opportunities here that I can take. And in the short run, and between the short and long run, I will definitely see myself I see myself to leave here and take advantage of everything but this is life as as my time being the gap between 2015 and 16. Sometimes things happen and life taught me that. Even though your desire is to be here, sometimes the circumstances put you in that spot. But in normal circumstances, yes, this country can give so much and I can also give so much that this country has got. \n",

      "M:\tBut what about life goals as well? Like do you want to get married or buy a house?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tI think buying a house doesn't make sense, especially this in this. Yes, in this market prices. It doesn't make sense but of course in the future. But again, to to give to sacrifice so much from your life, to make a property meaningful, I think it doesn't make sense to me. I mean, the condition that the mortgage is important. I see some people that they are working for the mortgage for their entire life, but you only be once. How does that make sense? Instead maybe depending on the circumstances maybe buying your land and building my own house that's more meaningful. But again, it depends. So, of course, I would like to get married, again that the marriage meeting that doesn't mean a certificate. Just to get connected with someone forever, because I know some people that they are actually married in paper, but they're not connected. So, living separate lives. I don't want that type of relationship. So, it shouldn't be based on satisfying sexual needs. It should be based on connectivity, chemistry, and you should have your own space at the same time, which means we need to respect each other's space and also share and build something together.\n",

      "Toronto is not a good place for romance. We can meet so many new people, so many girls. But I think the connectivity is missing? Everybody's excuses is I'm busy. That's one thing. But other than that, I think this is a place that people living life most likely casually. I mean, casual relationships. That's what I mean. So that's why it's easy to meet new people, but it's not easy to provide the sustainability.\n",

You know, you're asking for a date or something. But yeah, definitely, just uh, I don't think that the using the online tool Is this helpful. I tried five years ago, but it wasn't working, the online dating. It's so shallow and because you already… I'm not sure how to… I'm sure there's a sociological pathway behind it. But first of all, you're judging them by physical attributes. That's how you say yes. I think so not so many people reading the profile descriptions of that specific person. And when you meet there's a certain shy border and there's no uniqueness. Because everything is all structured. I think there was a documentary in Netflix about this, this topic. It was actually I'm just trying to remember the name of it. Black Mirror. There was an episode that. So that's a good one. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mi:\tThe first feeling? It was it was tiring [laughs]. It was tiring, but I'm proud of myself In that sense that, Okay, I'm not, I'm proud of myself not to accomplish a citizenship process. I’m proud of myself that I gave myself a timeline to reach my goal. My initial goal was to get my Masters in the first place before I came here, because a lot I would make it may be shorter, but maybe it was meant to be this way. I believe in certain holistic things. And so I'm proud of myself that I thought about failing, I mean, if I was failing or not, or I thought about if I should change my path or anything, but I'm happy where I am right now. That's why I'm proud of myself. That maybe I had to go through all this. It made me stronger. Was that worth it? I think it's worth it in a sense that I am able to open the door to reach my ultimate goal regarding my educational view, right. But at the same time, it has taken certain things from me. The couple things that I want to mention, first thing that the family connection as much as I'm connected with, with my family using the communication tools, the technology and all that. But still, I didn't have a chance to witness, they're getting older, that process. I wanted to be with them. But at the same time some part says that this is life and we need to find your own path. Other thing is what I noticed, I think it's by this age and also what you read through to me, I was giving more meaning to the friendships to relationships, but it got diminished. I think during this process, I also seen some personal disappointments too when I was relying on certain people and certain friendships and relationships. That and then that's why also I just certainly focused on education. And to proceed in that field. So yeah, I think some part is missing, definitely I'm not the same person in the first time, when I first moved to Austria. Of course, age plays a role and the enthusiasm in certain things is different. I put more logic into things rather than intuition. It kind of makes me happy because the failure stage is not there. I know that how not to fail certain things which is which kind of makes me kind of happy. But at the same time, what makes us human also… that intuition that's, that's humane touch. But in Toronto, referring to your previous question about dating, or meeting new people. It's meeting people is not a problem, but having that meaningful conversation, It's a problem. I'm not trying to put myself in superior situation or degrade them or finding that put a scale or something. No. But maybe they are in the same situation maybe my, my way of talking to them, my interest levels are not appealing to them, its compatibility. Do you believe that putting up excuses, or is it just an excuse for people to have priorities? If you're really stressed with work, and if you're going to meet people right after your stressful shift, that's not going to be a worthwhile time.M:\tIt is recording. Let's get started. So when did you first migrate to Canada? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tIn 2018 February. And this is a permanent residency visa. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tWhat were the motivations behind your migration here? Like what were the main factors you considered in making this decision? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tI think the main attraction was that they were giving a permanent residency like I was a US on work visa. To get a green in US for Indian National…according to some timelines, it's gonna take like 150 years. Yeah. So I can explain you why is that but that was the main reason. I would have never got a green card in US. So Canada was giving permanent residency easily so that’s the reason I moved here. So they have a country wide quota. They give green card from a pool of 7% of  the population from a particular country. So because India has a huge population, their dates are like...So, they are still giving green cards to people who applied in 2008-2009 from India, but for other countries like Pakistan, Nepal ,and Sri Lanka, they get it in one to two years. So that’s the flawed system that they have, especially Indian, Chinese and Filipinos are the most affected because of the number of people applying. So they have a cap of 7%.. So 7% of the green cards – they will give to a particular country. So that’s where the challenge is. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tSo there is a difference. In the US, the salaries are much higher, much higher than Canada. It's like less expensive there because of the city that we were living in but generally the taxes are less. So I would say the health care expensive there. But otherwise everything is cheaper compared to Canada. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tSo I went there in 2013. So from 2013 – 2018 I lived there. \n",

      "Sh:\tYes\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd how long I mean did you plan on consider your migration prior to move to Canada?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tSo I would say, like, six months. That’s what it took me for moving to Canada, like I had to do the IELTS exam, then create my express entry profile and submit all the documents. Once I had my profile, it took me 2 and a half months for the final approval. And then I got my PR cards. Then I moved here in Feb 2018 so for the initial six months I was still going to the US for work, like I’d go on Monday and come back on Thursday. Yeah so I was still doing that for like six months but from October last year, I got a full time job in Toronto so im based here. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tRight. And like couldn't I mean, was there other pathways for you apart from getting the green card? I mean, like, could you just continue working?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tYeah, I could have continued working there on work visa but there are a lot of restrictions on the work visa. Like, when you're switching from one company to another company, you need to redo the process again. They are increasing their timelines for giving you approval for your work visa. And then like, if your visa is expired, your driving license expires as well so there are a lot of implications that comes when your expires. And then my wife, she did Masters in US as well. Unfortunately her visa was not fit for H1B so she had to quit her job. So she was on a student visa and she was working on her student visa. But she was not from stem background. So she gets only like one attempt at H1B and her visa was not in the lottery. So they have like, I think they allocate 5000 visas, and they’re like 250k people that apply for them, Right? So like one out of to get like 40% john 30% chance that will be picked in the lottery. So it's not skill based. It's actually lottery based. Yeah its luck based. So she did her Masters. But she couldn’t get a work visa. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tBut she could still be on your visa, though. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tYeah like she could still be in the US but she could not work. And so that was the main driving factor because I had work visa till like 2022, so I could have stayed and kept living. I had a good job, reasonable, well paying job but then we decided to move to Canada just to feel more stable and secure in our head…And of course, my wife… and she landed a job as a we got here as well. She’s an architect. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd in terms of your family's is just you and your wife and your, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tSo we just had a kid. So yeah my Mom  cameand then my brother, he lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. He did the same thing. He did his masters and now he started working there and I have a younger sister as well. She lives in Delhi. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo what was the sort of family's broader role in your migration like even getting out of India for the first time for example, like were they very supportive of it what it was? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tYeah. They were supportive. So I went out from India for work. So ofcourse, they were not paying anything and I was getting paid to move.  But then when I had to move to US, I had to take student loan.  But because I had worked in Singapore for some time, I had saved up some money for my education.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tNo that was not the plan. I was planning to work in India and then study in India and do my MBA in India. But then I got an opportunity to work in Singapore. So I moved there and after moving there, I realized I cannot stay here for long. Like it’s a place where you can stay for one or two years not longer than that. It’s a very small country. There are very limited job opportunities there. Salary wise, It's like, not too much and the work culture as well, Its like, I felt I cannot stay there for long...like I don’t have a long term instinct for staying here.. So what next, so that’s where the US came in. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tSo I have mu childhood friends who moved from India to Canada. So I have few of those and then I have some distant family, and my wife has her friend circle. So, they helped us in settling here but for decision making not…It's because I mean, we, we did our own research... we didn’t talk to them much. But once we were here, they helped us out. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd how long did the initial like this visa process take?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tFive - Six months. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd finally, in terms of destinations, I suppose that you wouldn't considering Canada, could you go elsewhere?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tCanada was our top priority and that’s because it is closer to the US. So, I had that in mind like if anything didn’t work out in Canada, I could always go to the US since I had my contacts and all. Also when you become a Canadian citizen, you can work in the US on a different kind of visa. So that’s an added point as well. So yes, Canada was on the top for us. I can say it was the only priority. If not Canada, then we would go back to India. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo as a Canadian citizen, you can pretty much go and work there indefinitely, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tYeah. So you get something called CN work visa and you get it at the border. So you don't need to worry about the lottery and…So you can get the visa and keep on renewing it. So, it's better compared to the work visa. You’ll never get a green card on that visa but you can stay there and work there indefinitely. And its still a skills-based visa. So you need to have a certain degree and you need to work in a certain profession. Then only, they will give you that visa.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo tell me about your skills now I mean like what what is what is the skills that you applied with? How do you consider yourself a skilled migrant? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tSo I mainly work in IT consulting. I have like around 10 years of experience. I did my Masters.. that’s management information systems from Buffalo. State University of New York at Buffalo. So I have a Business technical consultant background. So I work both on the business side and on the technical side. So right now im working for a banking client here. So that’s where, I have my skills. \n",

      "M:\tSo I suppose my question so I'll ask you the question and then based on the question you can map it out, right? So tell me about all the visa categories that you went through from the point of your initial departure from India to current status. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tSo this is Singapore one. And then you also have from here.. the US. So that was from Singapore.. that’s the student visa. And then US work visa. So student visa for like 2 years and then you get the student related work visa which is the H1B. And then you get H1B which is 3 years and then you get a H1B extension that’s again for two years. So you get for six years but if your company files a green card for you and if you are at a certain stage for your green card, you can get it extended for n number of years. So I was in the process. I was in the middle of that process of filing my green card. So, I could have extended it for n number of years. So I would say within Green Card process. So you don't actually get the green card, but because you have crossed a certain stage in your green card process, you can extend your work visa indefinitely. So maybe just say extending it indefinitely. Then I took the permanent residency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo commercial services that you used in your migration journey from initial stages to even your current status. So I want you to think about between this part so this was work related so work did everything for you. So pretty much all of the processes throughout this process where you spend money?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tSo Singapore I didn't have to spend anything. My company did my work visa. They did my flight tickets and everything as well, initial accommodation as well. So nothing here. So US student visa, I actually hired a consultant to help me out with selecting the universities, doing like a lot of paperwork for different universities. So, I had I hired a consultant. The consultant was based in India, Delhi. They took inputs from me, of course, and then they like based on my GRE score and my TOEFL scores, they advised which universities would be like ambitious for me, which will be like, suitable for my score, which will be like, like, easier to get into. So they divided the list of universities in three categories. And then I like, I applied to a few in the ambitious category, few where I would get in easily and few where theres a 50:50. And I got in between, So GRE is generally like it's maths and English. And TOEFL is just English. Yeah. So GRE is what gets you admission in like science courses and then TOEFL is the one for English. I mean, these are different tests. So I got a decent score in the first attempt in GRE. So I didn't have to take it multiple times. But yes, you can take it multiple times and apply with different schools. And you get your health insurance from the university as well. Yeah. So you need to pay like a little amount and that was discovered by the university. But yeah, like flight tickets from Singapore to US.. I did them and then universities have their application fees as well. I would have applied for like five universities and then I got an admit from like 3 universities and then I had to choose like, one of those 3 universities. A lot of thought went into it, like one thing was return of investment, like how much I how much my tuition fees would be, and what I'm expecting, like, a package once I graduate from there, how easy to get a job. So that was one of the criterias. Like, there was a university, which was really good, but the fees was too high for me. So I didn't accept that invite. So that was like some of the considerations. So tuition fees. I use, like Facebook groups. University had a Facebook group. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd in terms of now, Canadian, PR what was some of the commercial services that\n",
      "\n",
      "you have an agent for this one?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tNo, I didn't have an agent. I so this was something called Canada visa forums. So I used those forums to get all my knowledge and information. They were they helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't need an agent for Canada. So they have a whole process. So first I need to give the IELTS exam and then I had to get my degrees verified from WES – both for me and my wife. So that was the pre, the process before I applied. Once I got selected in the express entry... So, you get a particular NOC code so you apply in a particular code. So probably that's where my skill came into picture. I was able to apply in I think software consulting code or something like that and I also got nomination from Ontario. But I didn't have to use it because I already had submission points. But that's again based on the NOC code that I had applied into. I had like 478 points. So I didn't have to use but Ontario wanted to give space based on your NOC code, so they did give it to me. but that's a longer process. And I had enough points without PNP. So, there was more that I had to spend here. We had to show money, we had to do medicals, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd this point [US work visa] was your wife with you as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tNo - she was in India. It was a typical arranged marriage. But she took the student visa. So she studied in the US as well and I invested in her study, so that's a whole different process. She came as my dependent. Then she switched to student visa. And then she was applying to apply for US work visa. So I was on h1 and so she came on H4 dependent visa. And then switched to F1 student visa. So F1 and then she again, switched to my H4 because she didn't get the h1B. So after H1, theres something called the OPT visa. So you can work for… so that's like a student work visa. OPT. So if you are from a technology background, you get it for three years. But if you are like an MBA or architect in her case, you get it for one year. So if your course is not part of STEM courses, you get it for one year. Otherwise you get it for three years. So, she got it for one year. That's why she was able to work with us for a year after graduating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd what does this h4 dependent process have? Like you must show some paperwork there too, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tYeah but that was handled by company. Typically, h1 visa is handled by your company they do all the paperwork. I mean, they of course ask you documents, but then they have their own attorneys and lawyers who take care of submitting and everything. Student visa is you but work visa, your company does everything. They need to file on your behalf. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tI mean, the initial student visa would have been the main process for your wife\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tSo we did the same thing like hired a consultant back in India again, again, and she was in India when we were doing this process. So you give your GRE, you give your TOEFL. So she had to go through thw whole thing and again applying in multiple universities and then you get an admit. Like I've lived in so many cities, Toronto is where I can say okay, this is such a good diverse city. I really like it actually. It's very, very nice. Like, we were married for like four years in US. But we had a baby only when he moved to Toronto just in last one years because we feel like this is a place where we can settle down. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tReally? Wow, that's interesting. So, what is it about this place that makes you feel that way?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tIts so open. Like I’m a Muslim. I was fasting I went to my office. The white guy in my office… I told him I am fasting… the white guy in my office. He kept his chips bag in his bag. So that was like new to me. Like in US no one knew about it. What is it about…what I'm doing? But here I could be myself and still I would be accepted. I think the diversity aspect. People know here. They have grown up with with diverse people. So, they are open to that. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo we will move on, sorry, to the questions of this forums. And I want to know ask you about generally about technology. So tell me about the role of technology apart from your technology degree…from the initial sort of research stages to current migration status, conducting online research, resources that you used, or what sort of forums that you used social media that you used for any sort of general broad uses of technology as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tOkay, so yeah, I mean, again, for doing research about the US universities, I did a lot of online research. I joined some Facebook groups. So those groups were, like specific to those University. So they were so it was mainly for Indian students. So Indian student organizations would be there in each university. They would interact with the aspiring candidates and help them in making a decision as well. So Indian Student Associations at universities. So they helped in settling as well. Like when you arrive at the airport, someone will come to pick you up and they will help you get a room as well. So I mean you need to pay for it but at least someone is showing up at the airport in a new city, new country at odd hours during the night, and then they give you like initial accommodation for a week. So they will arrange accommodation with another student who would keep you in your in their house for the week until you find your own accommodation. And take you around Walmart and all, help to buy stuff and help get a phone connection, everything so they actually help you during the first week. The expectation is that once you become a senior you will help other students too. So Canada visa forums is where I got most of the information from starting from how to take the IELTS exam, how to do WES degree verification. Luckily like because I did my masters in us I didn't have to get my Indian degree verified otherwise in getting my Indian degree verified would have been a big hassle…sending my documents from India to US. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tWhat about like a regulatory stuff like police checks and stuff? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tOh, yeah. So that was part of post ITA… like when we did our medical. We had to get police check done from India, Singapore and US. So, for my wife India and US. For me, India, Singapore and US. That process was fine for India like we had to write to Chicago to the Indian embassy and we got it in a day.  For Singapore I had to send my fingerprints to Singapore for verification. For US it was a lengthy process... not a lengthy process but it was time consuming …took me three months to get my FBI check from US. So, from Singapore and India, it was quicker but from US it took a lot of time because that's how their process is. So they take you fingerprints and then they give a report saying all clear or something. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo actually, I think I'll try back a little bit. Why not? Why did you have to go and study in the US? Like, why didn't you want to do your masters in India? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tSo the thing was, you know, to get in a good MBA college, for example, in India, there's so much competition there. It's difficult to get it. So, getting a university admit for US was much easier than getting a university admit in India, because there's so much competition. They have something called quota system, so that pulls you down as well. If you are not in quota, then you have like limited number of seats that you can applying to in general category, you have like 30-40% of seats that you can apply for and the quota is restricted for minority caste. Its not based on your religion, its based on your caste. So if you belong to a certain caste, like schedule caste, then you get into it and that pulls you down as well because most of the seats in government colleges are reserved, and even jobs and jobs as well for government offices you have that reservation. So, so for general category, you have a limited number of seats, and so much competition like everyone is doing Engineering or something like that, and then everyone wants an MBA. So IIMs are for MBA and IITs are for IT. So to get an admit in the top 30 Universities in India, it's like very difficult and the other thing is the return of investment. Like you spend like a lot of money in India. So those colleges are expensive. They are cheaper compared to US, but they're still like, half the fees as you pay to the US. So you pay that much amount and after that if you get a job, which is a high paying job in India, but still, it's going to take 10 years to pay that load. So you don't want to be stuck in that. In the US, okay, the fees is high but the salary is very good. So you can like pay your student loans, pretty quickly. So like, I paid my student loan in one year. So I got it the student loan from India. Yeah. So there was like 11%, 10% interest. Same for my wife as well. My wife was, it took like two years [to pay off] because hers was like a huge amount. Mine was not that high. Like for my student loan, I just put some money in a fixed deposit. But for my wife because it was like a huge amount, so we did have to like mortgage my house back in India. So, you give you a house papers to the bank. They keep it and then you need to keep paying and once you're done they will give it back. So this was my dad’s property. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo the role of family that you want to maybe put on your map?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tFor for the US as well, you need to show the money. So, yes my dad helped out with that. So you need to show a bank statement that you have tuition amount for one year for the first year. So bank statement and loan amount like loan statement that you will be getting a loan. That’s what becomes your….His bank statement and loan - they are the I'd like to two separate things. So you need to show cash as well. So we had to show a letter saying that he's he would be like, financing my studies. And then he showed his bank statement as well his salary slips as well – everything. Marriage is important…So much in migration, like they were supportive. But like, when I even came to US, I told my dad I'm going to US and quitting my job in Singapore was like, What is what are you gonna do there? I was like, study there. I told him that I got an admit for these universities and he was like okay how much?.. and I said..this much I can afford, and this much, you’ll have to help me out. So for making that decision, it was my decision, but they were supportive of it. Then tell me okay no you cant go or anything like that. Marriage did play a role. Like staying in the US, I was on work visa. My wife was in a different city. I was in a different city. She was studying in a different city which was like, six hours drive. And then she was working in a different city as well and that was a 4 our drive. So I would go on Friday and come back on Monday. So, it did, it became a task. Now were both in Toronto…we both live in the same city, we both work here. It was because of jobs and stuff. Like the city where I was, she wanted to study architecture. There was not many good universities around that area. So, we had to find her a university that was slightly far. And then for work as well. You need to work in an architecture firm which would sponsor your work visa. So they will not many forms in my city who are willing to sponsor the visa. So whatever job she got in a different city, she had to take it because they would have sponsored her work visa. I was working in Indiana. She studied in Kansas and she was working in Missouri. But they are like adjoining states but still different states. And my parents were supportive of that, her parents were supportive of that so that’s where the family came in. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tYes, for example like for this Canada thing, I told Canada visa forums, but then I had few colleagues in my company who are helping me out as well. And then when I told my employer that I got a Canada PR, so they, they were supportive. They like they made me travel from Toronto to Indiana. They paid for the flight, they paid for the accommodation, they paid like $60 for food as well per day. Just so that I can stay in Toronto, and my wife can. So my employer was supportive as well. So it was Deloitte Consulting. But the salaries are not as high as US. So the salary they were offering me here in Toronto was… so it was same as in US numbers. But again, you have that Canada to US conversion, right. So I wasn't very keen about it, so I moved, I joined another company called Accenture consulting. And my company partner who I was working for. He was like you can like travel from Toronto indefinitely. You can keep on working in US and keep on staying in US till whenever you want. But I was like, No, I need to find our local job coz it’s a commute right? Like Monday I need to go to Pearson airport, and then do my immigration because I have a work with US. So every I have an immigration and every Thursday I have an immigration to come back. So like at the airport, I need to get my passport stamped every week. That’s a lot of stamps. And US they ask “Why do you want to go” and all but because they have all your trips recorded. So after a while they are fine. Like they don't ask you anything… they know. I mean, I would know the visa officer as well. They would just stamp it but then still a hassle to go, need to stand in a line to get your passport stamped and everything. \n",

      "\n",
      "Sh:\tThey're happy actually. So my parents came to US once. They came to Canada just now like few months back. They were helping us out with the kid and all, and they really liked it. They like it in Canada just because of the community. So I currently live in Milton. That's like, yeah, it's like too far from here. But initially when I came here for one year, I was living at Humboldt Park. So that's like very close to downtown. So that's when me and my wife are working here and now she's on mat leave. We needed to buy a house. Toronto is too expensive. So we need to move into the suburbs. The baby is 3 months old. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tI'm going to talk just about broad stuff. aside, so current immigration policies like do you do you keep on top of immigration policies? Are you interested in them?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tYes, I am very on top of immigration policies basically with what's happening in the US. I have a lot of friends there who seek my advice on there will be if they want to move to Canada, they seek my advice. And I'm also helping my sister for getting her PR in Canada and my brother as well who is on US work visa. So I'm like, on top of things what's happening in US and Canada. I think the US is biased. So there's a bill that is in senate right now, which is gonna remove the country wide quota for the green cards. If that happens, then an Indian person would get the green card in the same time as someone from any other nationality. But then the catch there is like people from suppose Pakistan – right now, they get green card in 2 years, but after that, if that bill is passed, they will get it in seven years or eight years. It standardizes time so it's bad for them but good for Indian, Chinese and Filipinos. Again, like in US the visa is based on lottery. It should be based on your profile. Like in Canada, they give points to your profile based on your work experience, your education, your age, and all that but in US it is still lottery. I think they were saying that theyre gonna make the green card based on your skills and your profile. But no, right now it is not. It's more of family based. So, if you have your brother is there, you can sponsor your dad for green card. Not like in Canada… like Canada you have like a proper express entry and a proper points-based system. Im in favor of the point the system because it gives an equal opportunity to everyone. Not just because you have your relatives here, you're getting a residency. Someone like me, who didn't have anyone here but still I got it so easily. It was because of this express entry point system. No [other countries considered].. It's just because I was aware of the American lifestyle, North American lifestyle. If I had to go in Australia, I had to start it from zero again, understand how jobs, things work, everything I have to start from scratch. But for moving to Canada it was just like putting my stuff in my car and then crossing the border. I drove. So it was like pretty easy compared to if I had to move to Europe or... Like I have my cousins who studied in France and are living in different cities in Europe. I think life in Canada is easier than what we are facing there because it's English here…language thing… like France and all you need to learn French and then it's difficult to learn at this age. With Canada also, I didn’t consider any other city because this is where you have most jobs. So right now, Im working with financial clients and a lot of times they have their offices in Toronto. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd I suppose now we can go in terms of your migration advice that you're giving your family and friends or do you actually actively helping them with the process? Are you involved in broader sort of forums kind of stuff as well? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tNot in forums. But I like, theres a lot of colleagues back in the US who Im helping with their PR stuff. I have friends in India who I'm helping, but not on forums, its like a lot of personal advice rather than giving consultancy. I mean, they already made the call that they want to come to Canada and just helping them out in the process and all and then telling them the pros and cons of coming here because there are a lot of cons as well. Like if you don't get a job, then it's a really expensive to stay. Youll be out of your money like pretty soon. So the job thing is amazing, I mean, once you get a decent paying job, its great. I mean, it took me like two weeks because I had a North American degree and its IT consulting right? For my wife as well actually. She gave an interview when we moved to Toronto and then she got her job. Just if she would have been coming from India, like my sister will be coming from India, it will be a lot tougher. Because you're already in North America. I think that helps. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tI think starting with Singapore, I was out from India for the first time but it's a totally different culture in Singapore. So, getting used to that culture was a culture shock. Like there is a big Indian community there and Singapore is also very nice, very safe and all. There’s like 3 national languages Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. But then, I can say Tamil people are the most racist… racist people I have come across. Like there are a lot of, like, Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils - even my colleagues there who were from there, they would be like, “why are you here”? So that was like issue. South India and North India – theyre like different. Like our common language is English. So that's the thing so that was one thing that I found in Singapore that was bit of a culture shock, or culture gap. Although everything was English so that was helpful but yeah first time out from my country away from my family. It took me some while to settle. I had to ask, like, two people in the train that… will you want to take an apartment with me because it was so expensive that I cannot take an apartment myself. Yeah, so that was for Singapore. Food - getting used to the food there. Now they have a lot of different kind of food but back then….this was in 2010-2012 (2012-2018 was US)… I think the visa issues in US, like I wanted to change my company but I was sticking with them because I didn’t want to get my H1B visa cancelled. It’s a hassle right because it takes four months, five months. Even if the other company takes us till they need to wait five months, and then they will never know whether your visa will be… your transfer will be approved or not. I wanted to move out of Deloitte, but I had to stick with them. Because I was scared of doing the visa process, just a process. It's like so cumbersome.\n",

He lived in a town in India. And then for his work he moved to Delhi. That's like a bigger city. I grew up in Delhi, but then I moved abroad. So that's like a progress for us.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sh:\tNo I think im done. So, my wife wants to move back to US at some point of time. Just because like you're getting better paying job opportunities there. Like, I might as well because like right now I have a… I have a like, loan on my house for like 20 years. I don't want to wait for 20 years to pay my loan. So, maybe just go to US, work 3-4years, get money and then pay off my house. I mean, salary wise as well and then in your day to day expenditures as well. I mean here the taxes are high, and stuff is cheap there compared to Canada. We have some tax there but like if you buy some items is 7% tax there. In Canada is 13% tax. And then house cost - the city I was living in US, the same house, it would have been one third of the cost that I paid here. That’s the difference. Salaries are high and housing, everything is cheap. So Canada is a place where you want to live a comfortable life, but you won't be saving much. And you want to save, like Salary as well…in US. Like, if you do an MBA from a top 10 University, and suppose Deloitte hires you, the amount of money they've give in US, for the same profile in Canada might be like half of that. If you move to a good city like Chicago, New York City, its good. Chicago has a lot more diversity, NYC has a lot more diversity. Just that in US, it's not very safe and the political environment there is again, I mean as a minority, you will feel certain things. Not so in Canada. At least they won't say it on your face. In US they can say it on your face. Like if you go to a Walmart in the US, and if my wife is in her ethnic wear, she will be little uncomfortable, like a suit.. but here nobody cares. Especially if you are in the smaller cities in the US, they're like, you really feel it.M:\tSo when did you first move to Canada?\n",

      "M:\tOh, sorry, I should actually say this first is going to be a bunch of basic questions. And then I'll go into the mapping. And I'll tell you when I'm on the right. Perfect. So what were the motivations behind your move?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tIt was basically just for something different. And I'd been living in all the main cities in Ireland for a few years. A lot of my other friends had migrated, you know, and just kind of felt like everyone was getting on to do something new and different. And I kind of felt like it was my turn. So yeah.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tYeah, well, I actually was just looking up, I was just googling places to live, you know. That's basically you know, and I hoped that I was going to move to Europe because you know I'm moving on my own so I was like oh, it'd be easier to travel back home and my sister lives in Berlin so she was there in case im tired of being alone. So I looked up places in France mainly and like other places but just nothing kind of really stuck out and then I know it's something that like in the week that I was deciding – I think about three things happened and Montreal came into my head…I think airlink had a direct flight which they promoted online and then, like things just kept popping up it like… it was the only place was kind of like calling me so I was like, its a bit further away and its a bit more expensive to be set but it just kind of was the only one calling out and that’s why I chose it. And like as well because I knew when people have gone Canada before and like although you have to go through the visa process. I mean, once you're there it kind of seems straightforward enough, whereas I know that France is known for its bureaucracy, and like filling out forms and making shit hard for you. So I was kind of like know that kind of put me off as well as a few friends that that had been there on Erasmus, and they were like, I don't know. So yeah, and cheap rent. That was a big thing coming from Dublin because I got so annoyed overpaying for stuff that wasn't good. And now I pay less. I paid for 700 euro for room in Dublin and now I pay less for an entire apartment to myself with bills included so it's Yeah, it's a lot better here…you get a lot more for your money here.\n",

And because I've been there for I mean, I thought it was gorgeous like, I mean, I like I like if somebody told me to move there, like I would agree, its happening. So because I when I went to visit my friends over there, I was like, this is gorgeous. I can see why people wanna live here, its lovely. But it kind of was also felt like that was their thing they did it so I kind of wanted my own thing and then it was kind of between Montreal and Toronto. But like I said. Toronto seemed nice but it just… it just seemed like a kind of random city to me…there was nothing really pulling me towards it whereas Montreal, the culture of it just it seems I really wanted to try it and I always was like, Look, If I get tired, if it gets too hard with the French in Montreal, I can always move to Toronto. It's not that far like, I flew in from Toronto and I've been connected on flights from there anyway. So yeah, it's the same distance. So I mean, I still have it at the back of my head, I could always go but I don't know. I think I really like it here so. \n",

Yeah, it's culty thing. It’s like a big in Dublin for like different Kipper. Like they have like, you know, proper divides with salt and vinegar and stuff whereas supermarkets sell it but they don’t have that kind of stuff…I think they there was some talk of it and bringing one to Australia a few years ago because of so many Irish living in Australia. But I think that fell through but there are actually I actually don't know if there are if it's gone international. But here's so many in Ireland. There's four in our town. Yeah it’s a big thing.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tYes. So when I left college, I had absolutely zero idea what to do. So I was working in a cafe I think, just before I finished my degree, so I stayed there for another six months, I think and then I moved to cork and my goal was to get work with like newspapers get some sort of a journalism writing job. So when I moved there Initially, I just wanted to get any sort of job and right away. So I worked in a cafe for a while and I was like, okay, it's fine. I'll do this for a few months and then I'll get my proper job. And then I ended up loving working there. And people there were so nice, it was like a little family so and after a few months of working there, I was made assistant manager. And then I was like, Oh my god, I actually really like this. Maybe I'll open a cafe myself, you know what I mean? I was kind of toying with that idea. And I stayed there for two and a half years, I think. And at the time, I had gotten a freelance job with The Echo paper in Cork. So I was like, writing the odd article for them. And then I also got a recurring job with Roscommon paper closer to back home. And when I got a weekly article, go with him, so I kind of was doing that on the side. So I kind of felt like I was nurturing and whatever writing I wanted to get done. And then towards the end of it, I was moving out of Cork and I was like, Look, I want to get My big girl job now [laughs], so am I said I flew home for a while to try and figure it out. So year. Summer of 2016. Yeah, I moved home for the summer while I was looking for jobs. And then yeah, I got this one in Dublin so it was a sort of editor job for Sci-fi website. So it wasn't so much writing. It was like, just when I read the job spec, I was like, Oh, I can do this. It was literally just like, obviously, correcting grammar and doing mistakes. And I was like, Yeah, no, I'm perfect for this. I literally used to correct everyone's essay in college and like I used to do that for my brother and sister and like, I'm, you know, like, people who are like… known. Like, you got this wrong and like, You spelled this wrong, you know, so people are like, yeah, that's my job. So I did that for three years. And I loved it. It was so good. And I learned loads because I had not actually got any clue on this sci tech stuff. So I kind of thought it'd be a struggle. But then if I could look it up, like the lingo and whatever… And it was good because it was the kind of website that was trying to be accessible to the everyday person. So, it wasn't wired. It wasn't like reading each audience was kind of like, you know, so it was kind of actually good to have me there. Because, you know, they might say something and I'm like, Well, I don't really know what that is. So if I don't know what it is somebody else wont. So yeah, I was kind of trying to make the language more accessible. So that was kind of so you know, and then I didn't know I was between leaving that job and finding something else in Dublin, you know, something along the similar thing. But then I just, I felt like I needed something a bit, a bit more. So, I said, I'd moved here and the aim was to kind of stay in the same field, but I was kind of like, I don't care. So I kind of saw it as a career break. And I'm not here to, you know, it's kind of here for the experience rather than, you know, so I knew as well I'd be narrowing down my options. I don't speak French. So, I was kind of like, nope, I'll go and I figure it out. If its a job in my industry, Great. I just was kind of like Ill do whatever there's to gain experience…but luckily I got something similar now I guess write a bit more so it's been more I guess… so its copywriting so to describe toys for kids, and so like there’s a bit of editing and like doing newsletters and stuff like that. So yeah, it's I think it's perfect because it's similar enough to you know, that kind of an industry but also a bit more… like describing toys for kids..more accurately for the parents because theyre the ones who are going to be buying and but we're launching an app now for kids to play with so like even think of all the everything that goes on behind the scenes, like you know, you need to write the Appstore descriptions, you need to write game instructions, all this kind of stuff that needs to… it is for like three year olds, but also it's kind of like trying to align the language. So I mean, you want to make it fun and accessible, but then again you're not advertising to kids, you’re advertising to their parents. So, it’s kind of trying to pick the right language.\n",

      "Sa:\tNo, it was Art. So it was it was it was weird course. It was an Arts course with a specialism in human rights. So that was what I was very interested in the start. And the first year you do four subjects, I'm in the second year you drop to three and all the time your specialism is it's meant to be the four and they encourage you to do a placement. And so, I went to London for three months. And then I went to Geneva three months. And the goal was to find some, like I was working in NGOs and just being an intern and yeah, trying to work in like kind of fields you might be interested in. And then I went for one in Geneva because they needed a French speaker and you had to keep up with your French because that was my other subject… and then my final two, they we're in English and French and with the specialism of human rights, but you don't get final grade with your specialisms and so it's a bit weird that it's on the degree title and then you don't really, its not like you're qualified for anything. So and the thing that I love the most in the course was English and I knew when I finished then I was like I probably should’ve taken a year out after my exams and I probably should have done a straight Journalism course…probably would have liked it more, but you don't know that when you’re 18 or whatever. Yeah, so after that, English was my, what I was best at so yeah.. I wanted to then pursue a journalism career…\n",

I mean maybe of course Never Say Never, if I find something that I really wanted to do and I do, then kind of.. like also have a pin in that like if I want to find some difference. I just didn't know myself I just wanna get some experience rather than get a degree. I mean, I know people that have worked at night like whatever they've done like a degree. But like people still watch five years work experience. Yeah so Not right now. I cant see myself ever going back now. Yeah, maybe when I'm like 50, and I wanna try something random. \n",

And so I kind of decided at Christmas and then from January then I kind of started the whole visa process? So it took about January to April, I think just getting all the documents sorted, waiting, like it takes a few weeks each time and all that stuff. And then I got it in April. Yes. And then from April to August was just, like quit my old job and kind of plan the move, looking at flights, looking at jobs You know do everything I could do about it. Yeah. That was basically it. So this is pretty much about a year, like less than a year maybe. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tNot really, I think I was leaning towards this one, because I knew people who…don't know it's slightly different process to when they did.. but I knew most people had done this for Montreal. They all were like, it's grand. Its easy, like you apply, theres obviously like, you can get refused but I didn’t see any reason as to why that might be. I thought it was going to be straightforward enough. So no, I think there's only one that I was considering because I wanted to be open as well. It's an open work permit that I have. So I didn't want to like I didn't know if I could get directly like I mean, say like say the company I was working for in Dublin was international if I knew they had and office Montreal, it was perfect. That was great. I would have been wanting to sponsor me or whatever. But because I wanted it to be open I was like, that was it seemed like the best option. And I didn't. To be honest, I didn't look into too many other options for Europe. I think maybe because, I don't know, I think the Canadian website is done pretty well, like its pretty straight forward, I couldn't think straight forward because it's literally like, here's you, here's what you need, here's all your steps. Whereas I think with other places, it's kind of it's not like easily laid out for you. It's kind of like you need to go and find the information yourself. So I didn't really delve too much into it. This was the only one that I found pretty much everything on easily. And yeah it's interesting to me. My brothers in Australia too and he got into trouble because he wanted to apply for permanent residency at some point and then it just seemed pretty like convoluted and like… Whereas this… I mean, a friend of mine was applying as well at the same time, I don’t think theyre going to come in now but I think they just wanted to look at the option and they're like, Oh, can you understand this website. It is so confusing. I was like, literally, it’s the easiest one, not being like whatever, but I think it was like so well laid out, they kind of make it clear, and the time you need all these documents and you need all this. So it's kind of like..\n",

      "\n",
      "Sa:\tI hate them that’s why I left [laughs] No and so no, I'm really close to my family. That was actually a big point, I was like, aah this is going to be tough. The fact that I suppose my brother and sister living abroad – like it wasn't the biggest deal so I was like, oh, like my parents are used to it. I mean, I kind of felt bad leaving initially coz its like Im the kid that’s going now but my brother had just moved from Australia and now ..it was kind of weird timing because the day my flight left was the day he moved into Dublin so I was a bit disappointed with that because I was like, I would have liked to have been in Dublin for a while when you were there. But I kind of was also felt like a cross over, I was like right you can look after the parents now. I think it would have felt bad leaving if all 3 of their kids were not home. But hes home now. Hes living in Dublin. So, and then my sister Yeah, she comes home often. She lives in Berlin and its not that far. And I think she's planning on staying up there another few years. So so it's kind of like, Oh, yeah, like, I could do this. Now they had obviously gone over with boyfriends or girlfriends, so and I hadn't. But I was like, Look, I mean, I think I want to do something for myself, and I want to do whatever. So. I don't know. Like, I mean, it was. I don't know. Yeah. Well, my parents, I think, like, Yeah, like that’s tough coz I used to go home like every two years or so. So yeah, if anything, they were a possible deterrent to me leaving. But. It's fine, to be honest. And that was a big thing in terms of choosing Montreal. So I was like that, you know, when when people are like, oh, we're immigrating. We're going to Canada or Australia. So theyre like, they have their big Irish group and everything there and then you don't see them for years, and it's a big thing. And I was like, Look, I don't want that. I want to go somewhere that's not that far of a flight, that I am gonna come home often and I do want people to visit me often. So I don't want to do this big “Oh my God I’m never gonna see you again”. I wanna come home for Christmas and have to come home in March again coz a friend of mines getting married. I want them to come out this summer. So it's kind of like I never want it to more than like two or three months without seeing someone. So yeah, that's probably there's probably a big factor in where I chose. Yeah, yeah, they would have stopped me from going like to like super remote, something like Australia. And then just as well, so my brother has been there and when he came home I hadn't seen him for like, 2 years. And I was like, this is very long, like, you know, and because it was so far away, so expensive to go, it really was a deterrent. like, you'd be talking at least two grands for fights. And then like, with here, it depends on when you go… I think my Christmas flight home is going to be expensive but well in general its like $500 return. So I mean, which is quite good. I mean, obviously, you still cant go over board, because it's still an expensive life. But I mean, if you can get there to get directly in like six and a half hours or something, its not that bad. I mean there are places in Europe which are like the same. So its kind of like, so yeah, they’re are a big factor in what way right. And they probably the reason why I probably would have wanted to go to Europe, you know, It would have been easy to come home, but this worked out.. \n",

      "Sa:\tWell, professionally, it's definitely just anything to do with the writing sphere. Like, I definitely got good experience in my old job. So I think that becomes really like future jobs, like editing like any article. I even was kind of thinking like, maybe I'll get into the book publishing or something along the lines. Yeah, I'm good at basically taking a big pile of crap and trying to turn it into something concise and readable, and it's making it clear. So I think I'm good at that. And then writing. I done know, I started off again now and I mean, when I did articles and stuff before, they were all really like opinion pieces that like my own mind, whatever I thought, and I think now that I'm writing, although its fun, I don't think its like my strongest skill I think. Im good at it but it definitely can be better. I don't think I'm as good at imagination. I think I'm good at writing down what I know, and what I believe. And, and you know, there's that little push. I don't know if I'm definitely the person that will be writing books and all that kind of Yeah. But yeah, they’re my main like, jobs. I don't know what I have in life skills. I think I'm quite independent. Yeah, I mean, obviously, I'm here on my own. So, I'm kind of quite optimistic. I think so kind of, like, if I kind of was like, I knew what might hard to be on my own. And I was, like, comforting to know that it will be that like, the worst that will happen is that I can always go back home. I know, it's gonna it's fine. Like to me, I'm, like, you know, ive been on my own in the past as well. So I think this is a personality thing. So yeah. Yeah, I think, I think probably, it's not like, like if I wasn’t enjoying it, I think I'd be very proactive and Be like okay, well Oh my god, this is awful. I'm just gonna go home, you know what I mean? So like initially coming year, had a bit of, like I was worried about like health things and getting set up with health insurance and stuff like that so I didn't have a scare and I'm kind of like, Oh no, maybe I should just go home, but I'm like no things will get good, its fine. last week got a mouse in my apartment I was like, Well, I'm gonna leave the apartment, Im just gonna go rather than trying to deal with that thing. Yeah, so luckily my landlord is very good at he came around to me tand he sorted it out for me. But I think like I went to go stay in a hotel and I was like, literally like, I cant. I had a bad week last week. I think I was just like, because it was the first time I actually felt truly alone here. I was like okay, there's my stairs.. where I'm going to go when I was like There's no one like I can see…I don't know anyone I can stay with or anything. You know, so when I left the apartment, I need to go to the hotel so it's kind of lonely and a bit like oh now and then I'm kind of thinking of like ‘Oh What am I doing here?’ Maybe I shouldnt be here, you know, the spiral. So, you know, you have that then I was kind of like, No, no, we'll be fine in a few days, we'll get rid of it. You know, trying to, I think go to trying to be like, fine, you feel shit for a while and then get up and move on with it. So, I mean enough to say that if I hate… if I continue to, like, have bad swings here that I’ll leave, like, I'm not gonna worry about like, what people think you know, whatever. But for now I think yeah, this is what I want. I think Yeah, as well as that I think because it was in my house and then it was like, you know, when you come over on your own like, literally have like one base where you call home then you don't you don't have friends ,you don't have your family or whatever. So that's the one place where I could go and then I was like theres a mouse here. I was like, I can't stay here and I’m not comfortable here and then it was like if I’m not comfortable here then I'm not comfortable anywhere in this country so then it was kind of like probably a bit of an overreaction. It was just a mouse. It was fine. But you know it's little things like that they've kind of made me feel.. I hope that it was just one like when my landlord came out and checked, he checked everything like holes and like droppings anywhere. There was nothing. So he's like, I'm fairly sure it's just one mouse and it got caught in the trap and it was the worst night of my life because I had to hear it dying. But it's gone now and I think I haven't noticed that the last few nights. So fingers crossed. Fingers crossed. \n",

      "Sa:\tSo, I'm just gonna say roughly, and I'm going to maybe do a timeline. Yeah. So December is when I started looking at so… like, the first thing I have is just the websites, yes, just going on to like, government, Canada website. So okay, research on that. And then there was a list of documents you needed. So that involves checks say when you go to a doctor, and that was like going to the guards [police] to get approval of stuff. And that's stuff, like CVs, references. Like just basic info look I don't think it was something that nothing was like I'm… probably getting the Garda cert was the hardest because when they send it and they were like two weeks to get this back to us and whatever so that was pretty… of fingerprints as well. Biometrics yeah and then that was everything that I kind of give to them and then just go with it. There was no other real intermediary or like I didn't have to do with any lawyers or any other people. I was basically just doing my own thing, just going through the website. That’s everything they needed before I came. I'm going to say August then. When I came I had to go through customs and then copies of it all the documents that I needed initially of  money in my account, all right, okay and bank details and money so basically they either needed to have certification that you’re going to leave the country like a flight booked back home or your money to prove this you could stay there. They needed, I think it was 1500 dollars for this 1500 – 2000 Canadian dollars. Just make sure that you could pay for somewhere to stay for a while. And then for your flight back home so okay and they needed like full copies of all my IDs like everything like my passport and like all this I am who I am. I think that was everything then then they checked it over and then they gave me a SIN number. I thought that I had to go to like a place for it, like a separate office but they have a place right beside customs that if you want to pay something extra, like they'll process there. That’s what youre going to need to get your work permit. So they gave me the sin number and they gave me the work permit all there. And yes then when I was leaving the airport, I had everything ready that I needed to set up like for a job and the health cards is a big different, in that, you can only get it if you have an established employer, there was some other things in that I didn't have either. So I wasnt eligible for it. But I am eligible for health insurance at work after three months, so I have to sort that in January. I think that’s it. So the health insurance I have is a basic package it's like done, they do it for your visa. Its like a package for travel for like advice and stuff and then for basically health emergency so like if I die or if I have an accident. It doesn't cover like general medical and all that. You have to have a Canadian healthcare or you can pay private for it. So when I came here, I did have to go to a private health clinic. So I had to pay all those fees because I didn't have a health card and because I didn't have health insurance yet at work. So you have to pay all those fees yourself. It was my own like check-up. It was something that I want to get done even before I came over and I didn't have time. So, like doing over here it cost me more money. Yeah, you do have to go to a private clinic. Like that took a while actually trying to figure that. I tried like three numbers being like look Im not from here, like, where do I go? And then I was being directed to somewhere else. But the bottom line is it has to be private, you have to pay up. I think you can try and get like advisor has insurance, but like I think as long as I did, but it's not urgent. It's kind of like that's on you. That's the main thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd in terms of like spending money on all of these processes, do you have like a sort of a rough estimate in your mind of how much you spent on?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tOh Money! okay. So initially you have to pay I think its like $200 or 100 and 150 I think to actually apply to get a visa. And the visa itself and then you have to pay an extra I think it's 100 or something like that for biometrics and that's a new thing. I don't think my friends had to do it when they moved over. Yeah, it's definitely the last two years that they made it mandatory.  For all the documents and stuff I don't I think had to pay anything. Oh I had to pay for a new passport. So basically, I wouldn't need it. Basically my passport went up to until April 2021 but as my visa was going to be up till August 2021, even though I'm probably not gonna stay here longer than a year, I had to prove to them that I wasn't going to let my passport run out before my visa. So I had to pay for that. So that was like 80. that was everything for the prep then after that was like Yeah, so the flight out was like 550.. that was a one way so it wasn't hugely cheap for a one way. Airbnb for two weeks while they, you know, like, new clothes, preparing for the winter. Like I packed lightly because I wanted to buy all of my clothes here. And then I came.. initially, like setting up and everything so I don’t think it cost anything to set up, but cost to set up a new phone, internet, and gym just like as an option. Yeah, and then like your rent, because I think you can't take your deposit as rent, they're not supposed to. Some landlords try and get to pay the last months rent… like in Ireland you would always be asked to pay 1 months rent as deposit plus the rent and advance whereas I don't want to do that here. I don’t think its illegal but basically you don't have to pay it but like a lot of landlords will want you to just as a security thing. So because my landlord, I got pretty good vibes from him and like I knew that it was a good person he’s like, Look like, its just to cover ourselves. So I did pay it. I had set it aside to do that because I just assumed I would have to. Like I had done the research, but I kind of knew as well and there was a possibility that I needed to pay a bit extra. So yeah, that was an extra cost. \n",

      "\n",
      "Sa:\tWell, No. Basically I did searches on Kijiji and Craigslist.And then, what else, nothing more than the usual expenses of getting set up somewhere new like getting your travel bags as well. and then yeah. all the new life stuff because the houses aren’t furnished here. So I need to get a bed, and a couch. It was grand because the guy that living here was moving to Alberta. So, he didn't want to bring any of his stuff with him. So, I got a lot of stuff from him and he gave it to me for cheap. So he gave me like his bed, his couch and stuff like that – it was $200 it was great and it was obviously in the apartment, otherwise I would have had to like go out and sort it all myself and that would have been a pain because I'm gonna have to buy like everything. Here I had to buy like cups and saucers and knives and cutlery, like everything so yeah..I mean it was a grand because I mean I think some of them don't even have fridges or they don't have an oven or a microwave or anything like that but they're extra expenses for coming here though.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tUm, yeah, like that was the aim. I knew was going to be my so there was like no other opportunity for me to live on my own. Because I couldnt afford to do that in Ireland and we don't even have studios either. Like you might find them if you did a search, like one or two vacant ones. But its not really there…everyone just shares big houses whereas here it was, it was almost the norm to find one bedroom apartments. So I was like and it was a lot cheaper. So even though it's dear by Montreal standards, for me like it's quite cheap so I think it was the only opportunity that I was going to have so I was like I gotta try it. So that's why I did it. I mean, I could have gotten a room for like $200 anywhere and save some money but I kind of wanted my space, and figure out everything so yeah, it could be a lot cheaper to share. \n",

      "\n",
      "Sa:\tIts slightly less here I think and so what I'm earning now is the same as what I earned in my old job, I thought was gonna be slightly more because they tax more here. So it's not a huge amount. It's about roughly the same. But I'm definitely on a higher wage here than is average. Do you know what I mean. For the job that it is…So I think the wages are known to be slightly less…Yeah, it's cheaper… the cost of living here as well. So while you might get paid more in Dublin, you're gonna pay more for living, So I think it kind of balances out. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tSo it was all to do with technology, and then moving here, it was finding the apartments online. And yeah, like “moving to Canada” Im just gonna write that website. Yeah, because that was such a great website it gave me all the resources. It was set up by an Irish man and he…. it's just so comprehensive it gives you everything like up when I signed up, they messaged me every two months. They were like, you said, you're moving on the 19th. By this stage you should have this sorted and you know. On the day that I moved, they’re like, congratulations you're on the move. And then they're like, here's a video of seven things you need to do when you get to Canada. So its like first do this and second do this. It was so great. So it's like such a good resource. So like, technology just like trying for like, coming here. And then when I came here and we should be right Montreal blog because it's like a, loads of Instagram accounts that follow it and just to like for tourism, see what was good here and. Oh Facebook groups. Like, you know yourself. And then, what else, searching for the job. Oh, LinkedIn. I got my job through LinkedIn. I've been searching on like Craigslist.. like in Ireland it’s a bit dodgy but here everyone posts jobs on Craigslist and there was like, like babysitting jobs, It was a secret shopper jobs, It was like, massage therapist, but like, yeah, you know, so it was a bit dodgy so I didn't find it that great so I went on linked in. So I got like, three or four calls from places after that. So I would recommend for job search. Like, I mean, I used Linkedin quite a bit in my last job and I was like Why don’t I use Linkedin more. Cant tell, it was like, Facebook in the way that Facebook used to be big and now Linkedin is for work, do you know what I mean? I mean I know it's all about the jobs and like whatever that's what it advertises, but it does actually work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo these were actually job adverts on LinkedIn or you reached out to employers?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tno no no I was applying. There was a couple people I did reach out to but I didn't hear from them and I kind of know that like cold emailing and calling doesn't always work unless they're actively looking for someone like you. No, I applied to all the jobs and like a lot of them are easy applies as well, you can just click and apply to a lot of them. It's better than sending in a cover letter. Yeah, LinkedIn is great for that. And then at the job I'm in now and all of the toys and stuff are sold and targeted towards Amazon. So a lot of the works involves SEO keyword research. So that's a huge part of technology that I use every day. Oh yeah, Whasapp is key. I don’t use skype because we just use whatsapp now. So that's how I message everyone every day called everyone all the time. That's the my main source of communication for and then, like other social media say like for like us the likes of Instagram and yeah, you know, you know, so I'm gonna be the main source of communication issues. I mean, obviously, I’ve got inyternet set up at the house and everyone needs internet anymore. I got a good data plan joints with the phone. So that was good, because when I did have an internet issue, like I didn’t have internet for 2 weeks in the house. I was using up all the data on the phone and obviously going out and around, so its very important for like Google maps and all.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tLike three weeks so very lucky. Yeah. So basically, because I got the apartment so so… basically I came over on the 19th and I had the Airbnb for two weeks. So it's like I give myself the whole two weeks to just find the apartments. Obviously it might take longer or I'm not going to think about jobs, because my parents were like, “you don’t have a job yet, you sure you want to go over” and I was like no Im going to find the apartment first, that's key, and then look for a job. So because I found it so early, like I got here on the Monday and found the apartment by the Wednesday, like I got to spend all the rest of the time looking for the job. So cant remember the day and I actually got it but, I was assured that I had it so then I started on the 24th of September. It was an open work permit. So basically, I can work like the HR guys were like, okay, because you're from Ireland, I need to see your visa, I need to see your SIN number I need to see proof of my bank details but I think that was just to pay me. I don't think they need it. So once you get the permit and once its open, I mean, some of them. Obviously, if you came over with another company, and they were like it was a specified or if you're coming over to study, I don't think you can work anywhere. Like you don't mean you have to be a whole separate thing but because mine is very open, I can work for the whole 2 years. So I don't think I can stay here any longer than that. I mean, I think there is the possibility to apply for more time, but I think they brought in something new recently, that you might be able to extend your visa maybe in a year or two but in general unless you find like a specified job and they weren't willing to vouch for you and want you to stay longer..I was just two years ago I think it's fairly recent two years to do whatever you want and then after that leave..Yes, yes, it is. It was a pool. So like when you when you join first they were like applied to join some pool and then they're like welcome, youre in the pool. Now you have to apply to actually do something that's and then you do it and then they’re like, congratulations you did this. Now gives us this document… so was kind of like a little process like that, but it didn't really feel like full steps because I think the way they used to do it before, it was like a lottery and it took a lot of time and I remember my friend doing this, they were so stressed that … it would be like it could be sometime in March or April that we're just going to send you a message and then you can get on the internet and Its first come first serve. And it was like, I remember they were so stressed about it and then they got their thing whereas now I don't know whether the pools wider or its that they don’t have many? I don't think it's as likel at the time…so they're like between now and now… they'll let you know when the pools are open but I don't think it's like ….I think they gather all the first and then they select you from it. So it's not like the first person that gets in will get it. It's kinda like they do choose your from a list but I've never really felt that I was narrowed down or whatever. I think the likelihood of not getting chosen for it would you have to have something that would deter them like say like if your passport was invalid or if like updating the criminal records you cant come gere or like maybe if you've been here before and you're trying to apply again. So it didn’t really feel like it was…no maybe it was… maybe they chose me from list of people but like it didn't really feel like it was hugely selected because it was done so quickly. So It was like, within a day or two it was like here you’re approved for this, not move on to the next stage.. it was like this. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tYeah, no, that was the only thing that I had sorted  because everything else, like I cant find a job unless I would go in an interview, I can't find an apartment without going and seeing it, I cant set up a bank account until I go into the bank so Airbnb wass the only thing I can do from abroad where I like filter that down through super hosts and…I want to make sure that you know, the people Im staying with are good like that. So it's about like okay, maybe don't stay like, alone with a man, in a weird part of town you know, you know. So that was the only thing I had coming over. But it was really good to have someone coming over knowing that I had somewhere to be. At least it was like I'm going somewhere these people are expecting me to come here so it was kind of helpful.\n",

      "M:\tAnd organizing like your kind of move, like your travel from the airport to home did\n",
      "\n",
      "you do Uber or like things like that? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tSo I knew the directions from the metro. I knew that the place of staying was near a Metro. I was like that’s hand. But I did factor in the fact that I had a massive bag and two other bags with me, and I was just a tourist hanging. And so I had a few homeless people, like, like a few rough looking people come up and kind of chat with me, so then I was like, I'm just gonna take an uber for the rest of the trip. So I would recommend that, like you get to the airport and its straight into town, but I was like, yeah, ubers are much cheaper here so you just get an uber where you're going. Yeah they were great [uber and Airbnb] because it was so much cheaper like 250, for two weeks, two weeks, which is very good. I mean, like, I stayed at a really bad hotel that night when I saw the mouse. And that was like $60 $70 and if you do pay for two weeks of that, that's a lot more expensive but also it was horrible. So I'm like, it was like a one star hotel where it's like, at least at Airbnb, you have insider knowledge, people tell you stuff. Like they told me like, they set up my internet for me, they were really helpful. definitely would recommend that. Can I write this down like a travel section? And so I'm just going to come in here and then it was so Airbnb first. I Had a girl that lived here before. So she was… she went to college with me. She did same courses with me and then then moved here for two years. I remember seeing her pictures in Montreal so she sent me a document of that she sent to the guy who was taking over her job, but it was all like, what you need to know about living in Montreal. So she told me to look at the plateau which was great because I actually messaged her when I came here the first week. I only had 2 house viewings and I didn’t go to the first one because she told me not to because she was like, look, like you can go see it. She was like look its not the best street. Even the place that you live in is nice, your walk home isn’t going to be great. She was like a if youre living on your own, I just wouldnt recommend it. So I ended up just cancelling that and then I was like look I found somewhere else. So, I didn't go to that one. And then I got the viewing for the place that Im living now. And she was like, that is an amazing spot if you can get that in any way, take it. So, it was a huge help having her to be honest, to be honest. I mean, I could have ended up in first place and it could have been fine. But like, having someone who knows is so great. Like I'm from Ireland. I've been to Dublin. Like I know. I know things about living in Ireland. If you don't live in the city itself, if you don't know this exact area, if you don't do this street. I mean, you could take this is a great area, but this particular street isnt nice, you know, it's it's beneficial. Yeah. So having her like her insider knowledge was very valuable. I mean you could maybe find it online but then you would find like posts that were made in 2008. You know like, I don’t know if I could trust this stranger. But I knew this girl. I was like I knew, like, you know, to make sure we have similar ideas and stuff. So I was like, if she was advising it, you know, I, gonna trust her like, so it's Yeah, it was very helpful. I mean, like, you could, I suppose you need to know the area and its hard to like “ask where is good to live” coz everyone has their own opinion. So yeah, that was good. And what else? \n",

      "Sa:\tSo okay, I'm gonna put her down. Yeah. So she was probably the first that I had any kind of, in Montreal. initially I think I messaged her like a year ago I was like thinking move here I'm thinking of moving said lot of places. Would you recommend anything? And she was like yeah move here. So Im gonna say friend from college and then I don't knowlike, now that Ive come here, I mean haven't had a huge… yeah like it was mainly just I talked to like other people that have lived in Canada so like other people… so yeah friend of mine from work she lived in Vancouver so and they were like this little group you have like this like people living outside of Ireland. So yeah,  And I can write the Facebook group here and then that website as well. The move to Canada one, they have forums and stuff if you wanna post any questions or whatever. And here I’ll write down bumble and meetups but haven't fully used them yet but I'm just gonna write in the future because when it starts to snow, and I get more alone… yeah\n",

      "Sa:\tI haven’t done that yet because I think when even like the odd questions you pop up in the likes of forum thing I'm like, I haven't done that yet. So, I can't advice but I probabl;y should. I mean, I did a Google review the other day and I never use google reviews and I remember talking to my brother about it and he's big for TripAdvisor. He uses it for everything like here. He came see me in Dublin for like a lunch. And he was like, Oh, I think this place is number one on TripAdvisor. I was like, all right. Like I live here, I know theres a few places that are good. But he was like, but this is on Tripadvisor so hes very like, he's very trusting of it. And then was like, all right, well do you post on it and he was like no and then I was like you should. And then I realized that I should because I use a lot of like I would use the internet live like best place to go for this.. like best bagels in Montreal. I use it a lot. So I probably should. I put like one google review the other day for a restaurants because I went with my friends and it was so cheap, and so nice. And staff are amazing. Like, you know, like I'd be really compelled to do it if I had a really good experience. if I had a bad one.I know I probably should left a bad one for that hotel that night. I was just worried that like the guys would know that it was me. Coz Id just left that day but it was aweful. But then I went on to booking.com and like all the reviews were pretty bad anyway, so so I was like I didn't stay here because it was it was good reviews. I stayed here because it was the cheapest and closest space in my house. Okay. But anyway, um, No, I haven't given any advice, but I If I saw someone like obviously asking questions or like if they were like, Oh, I don't know about this. I mean, somebody told me theyre coming to montreal from Ireland, I would definitely sit down with them for three hours. And I think I'm still learning. Its all new for me. And I'm kind of like, I don't know, like why you asking me it's like, when people come up from the street? And they're like, asking for directions are and so I'm like, I'm trying to even come up with the words to respond to them in French, let alone tell you. Where I don't know where I am. I don't know why people approach me because I clearly look lost. I'm looking at Google Maps and someone's like, do you know where this is? \n",

      "\n",
      "Sa:\tIt has made like, I kind of like it, that I kind of like that theres a different language, and I don't know why. I find it I like the challenge if I like, I don't know, like when I came here first it was a bit of a shock that it was so widespread. And that's funny because Montreal people will tell you yet that the plateau and all these others  places there's so much English speaking there is so much English like 70% English and 30% French. I don't think that I think everyone speaks French so I think it's a bit of a shock when I get here first that, every when you hear in the background is speaking French and there was something nice about it though because it sounds like I'm here somewhere different, different culture, theres something new because like like I mean I can look at a sign and figure it out and like if you gave me a menu I can figure out most of things on it. It's like, it's nice to kind of feel like your brain has been trained to get into like work through stuff. Now I find it really hard to hold a conversation because even if I figure out exactly my word for oatmilk, I remember to request it, and then they ask me something in response and Im like… I don’t know. It is difficult, but when you learn a few words, and then you kind of make some effort to communicate someone it actually makes really good. So yeah, I actually like having it. And I would recommend those people like that they'd have had it in school. Say my friend that came she was at school with me. So she remembered few words and she was able to, like, do a few bits herself. I mean, if it was in German or in some other language like, I don't know if, like I was in China, I’d be fucked. I mean, it does help that I have some familiarity, but it's definitely a shock. Initially, when you realize oh, no, everyone does not speak in English. Just to hear it in the background, its even wierd, like speaking English. Even when I started my job was like, Oh, I can speak English. Okay, you know what I mean? And speaking with the flow as opposed to ummm.. could I … like trying to figure out stuff. \n",

      "Sa:\tNo. Okay news anything like that? No The only like, humanitarian like NGO like I mean I tried to like set up a volunteering when I came here first but that was for myself to volunteer. I tried to then they were like we will get back to you and yeah, and then because it was before I got the job, so I was kind of like, how can I lose time but then I was like, I don't know if you can Yeah, so I don't know, maybe in time ago nice now that I'm so good and no, I didn't I didn't use it. \n",

      "Sa:\tAnd so, the main thing I'll say is that I think we're beyond lucky in Ireland because our passports like qualifies us to go so many places and it's I think we don't realize how easy we have it. Like even someone who went to Canada and we'll talk about at work work, like they qualify to come to Canada but it would like so much harder for them to try and work abroad and like we really move so freely across Europe and like, like, everyone I know. It's like the worsening now I know with Brexit and how that's all changed. But like people in Ireland are always like Im moving to Australia or im mving to Berline, always moving somewhere and you're going to work and apply and you just have to set up your papers, whatever. Even to move to Canada bit extra to do but still fairly straightforward. So a girl from India who I worked with in Dublin. She had such a nightmare. She had to apply for a new visa every year. There was a rule where she… she left Ireland for like 1 day or 2 days in something in this calendar year and if she didn’t, theyd take away her visa. It was just awful. So I was kinda like, Yeah, I don't know they do realise that you work here. So I think it's made me more interested. So it's made me really I know, it's hard because generally, people get into  policy or policies that affect them. So basically, you know, you'll always see people like fighting for cancer research because they're mum died of cance and they are angry and rightfully so and they want something. So it's different when…. I think it’s a big privilege when you got everything handed to you that you're kind of like, this doesn't affect me or is like, I don't know, it's hard because I'm kind of like I said it was the same it feels wrong for it to be easier for one person and harder for another. It feels wrong that people get put in cages in America and deported because they just want to live there. I mean, that's, I mean, that's like a whole other issue, that’s like, asylum and that's like people that actually need to live there. Not just someone like me who’s like “I would like to go to Canada”. I mean, it's so, the privilege we have is completely ridiculous. But yeah, it has made me more, if not involved in it, definitely more like aware of how, like when you hear about people like struggling with little kids, you're like, oh, like I can't believe that you have to worry about that when I don't you know, and it really makes you realize that privilege. \n",

      "M:\tI think we're kind of almost towards the end of it. I suppose I just want to ask you about the biggest challenges or obstacles that came your way in moving. Is there is there anything that you want to say on that?\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tThe mouse. Yeah I can draw a little mouse. I’ll put the mouse because the mouse really affected me, and the health thing and the whole thing I mean, not being able to… like which hospital am I able to go to, what does my insurance cover? Whereas in Ireland it was just like, Ill just go to the nearest clinic. Its an added anxiety maybe. And the it's mainly the social aspect of it, it's not so much that I miss, like, and I miss not having my friends as well. Or that I really miss people that I love all my god, I miss them so much. I really want to see them, I don't have that so much. But it's little things, like habits that you have, and maybe it's an Irish thing of like the drinking culture that we have – its true [laughs] But like even like going for drinks after work on a Friday, like something like that, that I really miss that like it's mainly the weekends when you're…even last weekend and I'm like, I don't have this and it's like, whatever, everyone was like going home and like, have friends coming in. And Im like, I'm just gonna like, chill in my apartment. Do you know what I mean? Bit’s like that makes me feel a bit disconnected. Well, I mean, my friends have literally messaged and talked to me non-stop every day is almost like another job to try and keep up with all the correspondence like trying to get back to everyone. But it's Yeah, they've been very supportive. Yeah, that's the main challenges I mean, being on your own like yeah, I think it's just a big thing as well in that even if you enjoy it any kind of whatever it's different when it's so like say when you’re off over a weekend, there's always something to do when you're home, you have to go home, or meet someone for a coffee, like you to do all your social to do’s. And then when you the morning free to yourself for half a day and youre like yeah I need to go do something for myself myself. That's really nice when it's a choice, but when it's we don't have choice in it, It's doesn't it takes away some of the good from it. So like I'm like, yeah, it's very much enjoying going somewhere on my own. I very much enjoy spending the day by myself, but when you know, I mean, it's nice to still have the option that I might meet up with a person later. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tI think it really depends. I think it's really the place where we are so I'm literally in a warehouse in the middle of an industrial park. There's no… I think the closest hotel is like a 20 minute walk and there's no cafes nearby there's no shops nearby there. If you forget your lunch there is this like truck that goes by and I think that like, that’s your only option unless you have a car and you can drive to wherever. There's nowhere nearby. And like even when I was coming into the interview, I decided that I was gonna hate this place because I hate the look of industrial parks. You know like, when youre near and airport, you know what that looks like, its like urghh. So I think that's the main issue. We had like a team lunch the first week, you know, because I'm not the only new person who have which makes it a lot easier. And then they were kind of talking about doing like an Oktoberfest thing, and then maybe a drinking thing. And then before the Christmas party, so it feels like they will do social things. But I think it's more difficult to where we are. And they were kind of like, what we're going to go, you know, and then people were like, well, maybe we should just stay here in the office or drink here, because, you know, everyone is pulling from different areas. And they’re like its little warehouse, and if we drink here, you know, someone is going to get injured. And so it's kind of like, where do we go then? Because we need to get a Metro and a bus. It's mainly the location, I think. I mean, everyone there has been really nice, but I suppose it's the same as anywhere when you start somewhere new you're kind of like, I'm gonna be really nice and polite, but I don't know what your personality is. Yeah, I don't know if it's okay to do this, and alcohol just helps with that [laughs]. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tNo, because a lot of jobs that I applied for, I didn't hear back from. And there was one that was like, super stressy. And they were like, can you do like 50 things to get up to the next stage. Before you will even be interviewed before you even have a chance to meet anyone. So, like I didn't want a high stress job. And this job is not stressful, I don't even think people are checking on me. It's like, amazing, like they're so positive and no one's kind of looking over their shoulder making sure you're doing the work. So I don't want a job that I'm going to be obsessed with or stay late at or, you know what I mean? So I think and because like, find a job and setting up and then get holidays or something like that because I need to take Christmas holidays, I need to take holidays in March, and then that would be six months. And then I'm like, well, what's the point of finding a new job I’m here for a year. I think I'm fairly sure I want to go and stay for the year, if that, if don't like it, I might go home sooner. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tI think so. Okay, you know, you never know what might happen. But yeah, like I could end up staying and making more friends find someone here, you never know. But fow now. No, I think I've always seen it as like a short term thing. I'm just here for I just want to be here for a while… I want to challenge myself to live on my own. I want to challenge myself to go somewhere completely new and completely different. Find a job like all these things, Like Im done with some of the hardest parts now. And now its just like adjusting. Like I don't know if this part is going to be the hardest because it's always different when your mind’s occupied it has so much to worry about. Like, oh I need to find my apartment, now I need to find a job, and my friends visiting but once they go and you know it starts to snow it's going to be a bit more like, okay, now you have to like, not only be okay living here, but try and enjoy it as well. I think quite keep it short term, like a year or maybe even less than a year, then I'll probably make the best out of this place. I think it's if I keep the short term, I'm really trying to value it and I'm like no, enjoy yourself. I mean, you're not going to have this next year you're going to be home and Dublin or go away and you want to be like I wish I was on my own again. So I'm kind of like trying to be you know, trying to enjoy it as much as I can.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa:\tSo before I moved to here, so I was in a long term relationship for about six years, and that ended badly. So that was I think summer 2018. I think initially, your initial thing is like, I gotta move out, I gotta do something. I gotta cut my hair. I gotta go.. And then I was like, No actually gonna keep going and like, cuz I wanted to eave my job in summer 2018. And I was going to move to go away with him. And that was the whole plan. So then I was like, Okay, this big thing just happened. I don't want to change something else big in my life. You know, you've got your base, who youre with and your job. So I was like I'm going to say my job for maybe another year, and then I'll do and then I'll figure out something else. So I think that was partly why you wanted to Do something different, but I will say, That's why I came here because I don't like because many people have asked me like, did you move because of the’bad breakup? And Im like Well, no, I didn't mean to get away from anyone.. I didn't move to, like escape or whatever, because it was like, I always want to travel. I knew when I started, that he didn't. And I knew that would be kind of part of my life that I wouldn’t ger to do enough. I was kind of content. I don't think I felt that I was missing out on anything at the time for, I think it was all like, I mean, he knew that too, like many people do, My parents used to say it. They were like, oh, D, S are abroad. But you know, we always thought to be Sarah, you know, everything. And I was like, Yeah, okay, whatever. So it was always something that I knew that I wanted, and then eventually when the opportunity presented itself was like, so yeah, so I think that's why I gave myself a bit of extra time to kind of, coz obviously a breakup is hard, it's almost like I don't want to do this as kind of a reactionary thing. And then by Christmas and I was like all right yeah, I'm feeling good, Still though, I’d like to be single for a little while. Obviously when I have the long term or the short term idea in my head like that I'm not going to be living here for years and years. I mean it may be if I was in Ireland it might be different for I mean, I'm not definitely not actively seeking a relationship nor would I I mean, again never say never. I mean my parents were like you could me meeting someone in Montreal and stay there for 10 years. But I'm not really romantic like that. I still think I need a lot more time. I had a great year but being in a bad thing like that is hard. When you kind of get out, initially you’re upset but now I'm like, I'm actually really enjoying everyon,  I really like, you know, I like the fact that I'm here. I've never been here. I've never gotten this opportunity. So, it's kind of like it's all for the greater good. Yes, it has made me be a bit more like no to that. So yeah, maybe in a year.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sa:\tI think that's fairly comprehensive. And I'm really glad I came here. I think I made the right decision but then again, I think I'm that kind of person any way that I'm like, always be like, like, I never think that was the wrong decision. I'm not huge, like, everything will look like everything is predestined. And it's meant to be and I don't believe that, but I'm still kind of like it was the right decision at the time and if I choose to leave, that would be the right decision. And if I choose to stay for two years and then apply for another visa, that would be the right decision. So im kinda like, I'm really happy I came here, and Montreal particularly It's just like I love it here. Yeah, like I think yeah, it makes you realize what things are really valuable like, like missing friends and family is hard, but also it's kind of like oh, it's really nice to look forward seeing them and to really like value it like means I'm, I can't wait to go home for Christmas but I'm also not we counting my time here. It will be really nice to see them. But it'll be nice to be here too. So, yeah, I think it's good. I'm really glad I did it. I think if I had this I would have heard this. I think it makes you realise so much about yourself and other people when youre on your own. Like, it is harder but it is also such a great learning experience and you learn so much about yourself.M:\tSo we'll just start with When did you first arrive to Canada? \n",

      "Si:\tI have a work experience of 10 years into data handling so Im abusiness intelligence consultant and worked on this domain for eight to nine years, right. I worked as a trainer as well as consultant. So from last two, three to four there is a lot of hype regarding huge data is getting accumulated. And there should be ways in which how you're going to handle the data. When I talk about business intelligence, it is all about whatever data which you have, and the previous data, how the previous data can be used. So, this particular business intelligence model, it only helps us to predict how to work with previous data. But what about the data currently, which we have and how we will predict the future of the data? So that is what is your data science and big data technology. So I was keen into learning the next level as a having them of experience. So I want to evolve from one profile to another. So I'm over here to learn Big Data.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Si:\tWhen I think about countries outside like when I think about other countries than India, I'm into this technology space so I know what are the roles available in India for this particular technology. We are we don't have that much projects. Even if I join any any organization and work on onto this technology, I will be considered as a beginner beginner in the sense like I won't be getting profiles or I won't be I won't be getting directly to work on data. I'll be doing some documentation parts so I won't have an appropriate to work like as per my knowledge or As for my the technology, which is which is there in the industry right now. So countries like US, Canada and North America and US and all all these countries, they have advanced technologies, and they are already working in this space. So even though I'm learning big data so Canada, must be the technology space or the education space in Canada must have been ahead. It is talking about artificial intelligence and it's talking about emotional intelligence as of now. After big data there is artificial intelligence than there is now people are talking about emotional intelligence whereas in my country there is nothing no concept called as emotional intelligence. Till now, so, emotional intelligence is spoken by only a psychologist and people are related to medicine field, but not not this medicine plus technology is not it is not at all like, integrated as of now. So, I wanted to study abroad and I selected Canada\n",

      "\n",
      "Si:\tI found the process visa process for Canada easy. And, I selected Montreal as my friends have already done the course from this college so I had… I knew the feedback of this college I knew the feedback about the feedback in the sense…the living… and living conditions in Montreal. So it is always better if you have some people around in that same city and they're telling the guide you that these are the things you need to do in six months, one year, two years. So if I have a Guided approach. I was considering Toronto but there it was 2 years, 3 years of study and I’ve already done engineering. I've already done like 10 years of work experience into education industry only. So I have like lot ot… my profile also study and teach, study and work. And also I wanted to study much. So I just wanted one year of a specialization and then get into my space, like the technology space, how it works out and all that. I’ve seen Toronto but there was no 1 year course and as for my expense and budget, it was not that suitable for me. So, I selected Montreal. I gave a thought about studying in the same thing in 2019 Jan and I was about. So I just thought my friend friend told me that there is there are the admissions happening for June 2019 intake. So I just applied, I gave my prerequisites all the prerequisites… I gave my English test. So by March, March, and my academics, everything was done. I send the application and I got a letter of application by April end so I was supposed to come in June, but since I have been I was working and I do wind up that process. So I couldn't join in June. So I had to come here in the October intake. Like what Im thinking…. what is my mindset now… I've got an opportunity to learn and advance specialization. So I will be more keen into this technology related to data gathering and data handling. So, I'm going to just see what are the options that are available after studies after one year so at that time I will consider as well as per the requirement and all that what all countries I can travel to and work in from working based. So when I was doing your research about Montreal, and also there are many universities offering this. So, I might go into the Masters in the same space. \n",

The factor is, though, the course which I will be joining, I will pretty much knew that I wanted to do, whatever work experience I have, I want to go to the next level. So, for the next level, I need to be skilled. So if Montreal did not have the college or this course, I would have opted for another, like another city, also Toronto. So I would have taken a two year or three year course. But luckily I got the same course for one year over here. \n",

      "Si:\tFinances…umm… so since I am a working professional, whatever student finances are required, like paying the fees, and then does it go to deposit which is required for student to that was handled. And my fees is being handled by my family. So half of the fees will be sponsored by them, and half of the fees, I have paid it. So sponsoring is… is like a backup. So in case if I'm not able to get a part time job and all and I'm not able to manage my expenses then my family will come into play. I'm looking for part time work over here. Into the same skillset… like I have training experience so there are a lot of colleges over here, lots of universities over here, and if they'll allow part time work, I can work as an instructor. If it is something related to technology courses, I can work in a lab assistant. So depends what type of requirements they have in case if they have it and if the allow part time. \n",

      "Si:\tThey wanted me to move. My my mother, she's a retired professional professional in the sense, she was a principal in one of the school. My father… My father was a working In the government, he’s a government servant. My parents both were working.. Now they're retired. I have two younger brothers who both are into IT and the other one is into CA. So, like my family is a working family and, like, educated family. So, even though I'm I'm 33 right now and single, they allowed me to take my own decision and they said and it is your choice - you decide. If you want to be independent, go and live your life, do whatever you want. There was no pressure at all to get married and all. There was no pressure at all since, since if I talk about my mom… after getting married. At that time, she had just completed her graduation. After she got married, and after five days, she went for higher studies. My father and my father family allowed her to go do her higher studies. So two years she was away from her family. [Laughs] And she is the first person at my in my native to be a teacher. Like 30- 35 years back. So, we belong to a Maharashtrian community. I come from Mumbai so Mumbai is a part of Maharashtra and I come from a Maharashtrian community where we have mainly farming and so even in my native place, there are very few people who are educated and from my native theyve come to Mumbai. So, My father has come to like 35 or 40 years back. So, there were like 10 to 12 people... mainly guys only who moved from that city and they came to Mumbai, and then they started working and. The native city is Sangli. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Si:\tI have like, two of my best friends, school friends. They moved to Toronto, two years back. So but they didn't have any idea related to educational institute and how… what is the process and all but my friends, friend … a colleague, since she is working in Toronto, so she had, she had this particular friend. He studied in the same college, he completed his course and now he has moved to Toronto for work. So she told him that my friend is looking for some study opportunities in Canada so can you help her out? She's into the technical field and all and he said that why don't you consider this particular college since you don't…if  you don't want a long term studies. You want a one year course only. So this college offers one year course. So ask her to go to through the website and check it out. So she told me.. On 5th of Jan she told me about this. I checked the website and all.  She spoke to me in the morning around 10 to 11 o'clock. I just surf the website I spoke with my parents and they were like go ahead. So, in one and a half hour I decided which course I want to get into. I spoke with the college, like I wrote a mail to the college stating this all I'm interested into. Is there any  seat available. So the college sent me a list like you have to go through this particular process, then only you will get an offer letter and so by March end and I completed the requirement like giving the English test and gathering my documents and paying the registration fees and all. So the moment I got my IELTS result.. I got it in first week of March. Though I decided in one and a half hour about the college, but I took time to first understand the city, what are the different options regarding the same course, what other colleges are there. So I didn't find those that are… like there are colleges like McGill university, it is very much famous in history. But again, it didn't offer one year course. So it was offering a master course, two years, of course, and one year of work. So I spoke with my parents said, you already have a engineering degree. And you already have 10 years of work. And it depends upon you if you're selecting a 2 year course. And then again, one year of work experience, so my mom compared it with her experiences. After marriage, she did 2 years of studies and then she worked. So she told me what are the problems she faced, when you were studying and you are already married? And in my case, I was not married, I'm not married. So she said what are the problems, What are the things you will face so you decide whether you want to take a one year of studies, like a gap, one year full of concentration on studies. And then you decide to take your life ahead - marriage, ofr work which city, what you want to do and all instead of spending three years on education and then deciding. So, by the time you will be 38-39. So, what will be the life ahead? One year is fair enough for me to explore the city to understand myself and see how I take my life ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tYeah. So, when you were making this decision, was there an inclination of Yes, I would like to move here maybe settle here like, because you know this, you can migrate to Canada as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Si:\tSo, what this course offers is one year of studies and one year like the post-graduation work permit.  So, after the studies, very obvious, I will be applying for the post-graduation work permit. I will get the one year work permit. As the rule says one year, one year of permit, two years, two years of permit… I will have to see based on the type of profiles I get. I would be interested in, migrating to this country and settle over here. But it all depends upon after my studies, the work permit I get and depending upon the work opportunities I get. As of now for one year my whole and sole concentration will be on the studies.\n",

      "\n",
      "Si:\tIt is not a master course. It is what you can call it as a diploma course or a certificate course because the same college it has two years if master’s course also available. But since the college is offering this kind of course to working professionals who already have some working experience. So, instead of spending two years on the same course, they are like you take the certificate program and it has some 10 months of learning and then two months of internship…a project to do it and you are industry ready to switch from one role to another role.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Si:\tSo, as of now Im only into it for two three days. So, what I have observed is in trains and all the instructions are also in French. Even the bill which we get the grocery bill, those are also in French. So, the technology is so, what do you say, it is helpful you just download google translate into you know, French dictionary and you come to know what it is exactly. But what I feel is if you are migrating from one place to another place, you should be adaptable to that particular place. So, I should have done a French course earlier… I should have done it, at least the basic so that by communicating... I would be able to communicate with people or when I when my roommates and they're applying for a job. So, they are also like technical people. So, when they are going for some job opportunities, they go they do the interviews also and then in the end they come to know that they need bilingual people. Which is also pretty much perfect. Why? Because if they are working for a, working as a customer sales representative and if the client is speaking in French, and if they're not able to handle their query, so then what is the point? So they need to be equipped with the language also. So that is a problem which they are also facing so that the government is providing French education. So for students, for immigrants, free education is given. So we can take help from that. We are into this country, the country is also giving us so much facilities so it should not be a problem. \n",

      "Si:\tYes, I'm going to apply it depends upon the availability in the sense that the batches are limited. So I don't know when I will be getting the batch. But if I want to stay into this country and work over here, I need to be equipped with whatever is their prerequisite. So I will be doing the classes. \n",

      "M:\tAnd in terms of visa applications, like were you looking at different types of visas that were available to you or student visa was in your mind. I mean, could you have come directly on PR?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Si:\tYes, I thought about PR. But I just I did a research on it. I'm single. I'm 30 above. So, my CRS, my score, which is required, it is not. It is not matching with whatever the current score is. So, I knew after doing a one or two day research, I knew that I won't be getting a PR because my match my score won't be that high. So I'll be doing if I'm considering for PR, I need Canadian work experience and Canadian study experience. So, to bring the score up. Yeah. So if I'm, since I’m on study visa, I'm getting a one year of study experience. I'm getting one year of work experience. So the PR process will be easier after two years or three years. I can consider like I can consider for PR. \n",

      "Si:\tA lot of opportunities are available for skilled migrants. Im skilled – you go into any part of the world, you are into technology space, the world works around in different domains. So whether you are coming from an Asian country or European country, if you are, you have a background of a technology, the technology is going to be same everywhere. It might happen that that country might have an advanced technology. But there might be some places where the basic is required. So according to that, I do consider myself that I am skilled. In my country, I might be at the higher post, but over here, that particular profile, I won't be getting into this country, the profiles. The technology which is being used, it might have might have gone to the next level. So I can join from the starting level. I think even if I'm switching from one role to another role I need to start from scratch only. I can't say that I was Highly skilled at this role. So when I'm switching to the next role role, give me give me the position at that place, like at par. It can't happen. It never happens.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Si:\tIn my case, what I did after working in the industry for 10 years, I wanted a freedom kind of thing, I didn’t want to do nine to five jobs. So luckily what I did I worked for an NGO. So I worked for NGO for one and a half year. And so, over over there I understood what is the exact need of like, imparting technologies like what will be the use of technology. When you're working into the industry, you're working for another client, those are also technology driven. But the NGOs, they are not that much as par with the technology. So, they are into like basic, below basic level you can say. So, these are the people these are these are the sectors which needs to be, what you say, brought up. So, luckily I worked for 2 NGOs. Then this particular opportunity came up. So then I said that you have given enough time for the NGOs. And now let's consider, let's go to the next level, move from one place to another place, then let's, let's explore life. So, 10 years of, you can say, machine life, then one and a half year of new new life in the sense …into an environment which is not technology driven, social life, social life. So, over there also I faced problems in the sense that there were people who were not that much technology driven so they need to be explained and then then they were supposed to understand each and everything. So again, it was it was difficult. It was stressful because for them to know, the scrums and all, that is all new but for us we are used to it. When you're working we are used to it and then we get irritated, like “why I have to explain you each and everything again and again”. But for them it is new. So, I found those kind of problems over here, but then I learned patience. Actually, I have learned patience. Like how to understand how to explain a layman. What all things you're doing day in and out. So, I thought the same thing I tried with my family. I thought first I started explaining things to my dad. This is how my life has been for whatever new thing I have to get into, my family was like lets first explore, first understand it so that when you when you step out in the world you know that you will know what are the things, what are the problems that you will have so let's discuss in the family. Yeah so luckily I have that kind of family. My parents are they know what are the future things like what are the future problems my child will face so they used to prepare us in that way so from school colleges and all. In school also like while going to the college This is how the world is already in the most to travel, these are all the things you need to do on your own. So they started preparing us two years prior only and then they told us now go and step into the world. So they're [parents] calling every 15 minutes. So for them, they also sleep as per Canada time. Theyre worried. But now that they're like… before coming here I spoke to them and they were like “very good, go out and speak and meet people and understand them”. And let's see. For the, it is always like they should be, they should be aware of what she is doing and whatnot. And for me, it is like, for the first time was like an independent life. Though there were no restrictions. But always I knew that if I'm stuck, I have my brother. I have my mom and dad to help me. But now since you said that you share the Google Map and I will not know how to understand it and all. And so then I thought of connecting with my brother because what is that you did? But I landed over here. Like in Mumbai, we are used to Uber. So I was just looking at the options but then I realized that I don't have the data pack. I don't have the internet and so I just did my roaming. On roaming, so he just called me and he said what? I don't know. I will just wait and I will let me understand it. Then he texted me that these are all the steps are supposed to do and this is how I landed to this place.  So at times also when when I'm in the room, there it India also it would pretty much be the 5 of them so mostly speaking to them only. I have less friends. So you're also sometimes like sometimes like ….most of the time I feel lonely, like no one to talk to. But then through whatsapp and facebook, theyre connected to me. So ideally what they will do they will record a message…they will record a video and they will send me, like “what you're doing and all so that I don't feel lonely that I would feel that yes Okay. So in a night It's morning over there over there so I'll keep on doing those videos so that I don't feel homesick. So it is like when you have a conversation, a telephonic conversation so that during that part when you have those people contact. But they decided this idea of having a video recording, the video every now and then. So even after the conversation is done like after one hour or two hours you feel lonely again, just go and see the video. So, you feel that he is he is there in front you.\n",

      "M:\tso first, tell me about the visa categories that you were considering at the time of your move. Now, in your case, it was very straightforward, right? So basically, what you want to put there now is your visa status, including how long it took to wait for the visa. Visa processing time so so for example, you may start from January where you started planning it and how long did it take to get the visa..\n",

      "Si:\tSo Jan 2019 I came to know about the option, the study option. So that same time I thought of considering the work option, like work visa, if I could get a work visa since I have the relevant experience and about PR, PR option as well. So work option, not possible from the home country. I didn't apply. I have friends working over here and they said that you need a Canadian experience and then only you can get an opportunity over here. And so I didn't give a thought about it. So not possible from home country without local work experience. And PR – current score – so mainly age factor – then I had the marital status. So when youre married you get your partner's points, like primary applicant and secondary applicant and the scores can be added up. So because of these two factors, otherwise the rest of the factors were good. But these 2 factors affected my score. Then I considered studies. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd tell me I mean, I think this goes into the next question pretty much. So what did you do for your study? So I know that you said that you didn't hire any agents or consultants, but anything that you paid for. So think about document translation, IELTS, medical, any process that you have to do that you have to pay for commercial.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Si:\tNothing. I didn’t pay for anything. The website is very much clear. They mentioned what all you have to do. So, I didn’t pay for anything. Neither for my visa process also. I just applied for the IELTS, there are a lot of materials available on internet, A lot of forums which you can print out. Okay for the exam I had done the payment, but not for the training. People are paying for the training. The visa fees I paid, the medical test fees I had paid. So for the study option I need to get my transcript. I got the transcript in 2 weeks so in Jan itself I got my transcript. Then I did my IELTS registration so the fees I paid. This happened in Feb 2019. I got my result in... I cleared my IELTS exam. This happened in March 2019.  Then I submitted all the documents…submitted relevant documents I will write…to the college April 2019. And I got my letter of acceptance…acceptance I got in April itself. So after I got my letter of acceptance, then the college had mentioned those steps that I need to follow after getting acceptances I need to take permission from Quebec so there is one documentation, CAQ certificate you need to get. Quebec province says that if you want to come to our province, then you need to have a permission. So, you need to have the certificate. So I applied for the certificate and in total four weeks to be processed and then I got the acceptance. This was like $5000 or $6000 rupees. So it’s the ministry of Quebec. We need to write that we are intending to come to the province for studies since this is a French speaking province in the country so – rest all the provinces, they are majorly English speaking. This is the only province which has the French as the major language. So they need from like, they asked people the permission. So then they gave me the permission saying that yes, you are allowed for studies. So I had to do the CAQ… applied in April in 2019. I got a reply that was positive. I got it in May 2019. After that I was asked to pay fees and then the security funds. GIC loan. Paid half or 6 months tuition fees. That I did in May itself, May 2019. Paid my GIC amount. This is an investment certificate which we need to as a student you're supposed to do. Well you're saying that this is the fund which I have. So in case, its kind of security fund which you are putting in, so that in case is in the future if you don’t have any funding, you don't rely on government for funding because government provides facilities to PR to their citizens also. But we are coming from outside countries as students so they cannot accommodate us to have any support. So this is $10000. It is self funded. So there are Scotiabank and there are some other banks also. One other bank has started it otherwise before it was Scotiabank only. So $10,000 which we are paying, every month the government gives us back. So, this is divided into 12 months. So government gives you back so that you can bear your expenses and everything. It's not like you’re relying on the government. Like youre not homeless, you don’t have anything to do and all. The government has decided that youre coming to the country, you’re coming for your studies, you pay the security funds and then utilise that when you’re staying here. So it took one month to get my certificate and all. So after May, one month I took a break because I had everything, I just had to apply for my visa. For my visa I had all the documents and all, so I took a break, I went to see all Maharashtra. So I explored the different cities in Maharashtra. It was awesome. I never knew in my life that there was all these cities. I went to Aurangabad, and Sherdi religious place and I explored Pune with my family. It was a family holiday. Then my native place also, Sangli. Then met all my relatives at all before moving out of the country. So I met everyone. Then I applied for the visa in July… and receive visa in July itself. I applied on the 3rd of July. I got it in three weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo we'll move on from those questions. Now. We'll ask you. I want to know I mean, it's somewhere here. You would have done a medical test as though right?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Si:\tYeah. medical test. I did it. Umm so last week of May I did my medical test. Like two or three days prior to my appointment was on third of July. So it takes only one day for the medical. That's a half day. So I did it on 27th or 28th of May.  So here also theres something called the biometrics which we have to do. That was done on the same day, when we apply for the visa through VFS. So I applied it offline. So I had an offline process. So then I came under this non-SDS category. This is for working professionals. It's like there are two things SDS and non SDS. There are students who complete their higher studies – like 12th standard or graduation. Those who don't have gap any gap between their studies, they they come under SDS and those people who have a gap after studies they have one year of experience two years of experience, they will come under non SDS. So, this is suitable for people like working professionals. This is the student direct stream. So you have a certain level of education and then afterwards you're coming for a masters or a PhD. So you have done your masters in your country and then the next one, you are coming over here so you don’t have any work experience. So non SDS is for working professionals or those who have a gap. Since I did offline, so I had to do my biometrics. Same Day and submit my files. This I did from from VFS global. it is easier for the for the visa team to process. So when you say non SDS, they will ask for work experience documents. So, it is like the the form… the form which is created. Here you need to show gap letter. If you have a gap after your studies, so the gap can be working or else relevant clarification. So those who are working, they will show their work experience like joining letter, leaving letter and all. I showed my work experience because I was working till June. \n",

      "M:\tSo let's just work on these maps. Now you pretty much will be basically keep adding information in the same map, because now the questions are about these processes in a little bit more detail. So in terms of let's talk about technology. So how has technology supported your migration from the initial stage till now? Technology meaning, conduct online research, what resources or websites used, social media that you used, and current social media that you use in your journey now as well even to maybe stay connected with your family, for example, or maps or things like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Si:\tSo basically I used Google website, college website, CIC website. So source is nothing but Google. So basically CIC website is good enough. What I found if you go into the forums there are multiple people who will put their questions. So you will find lot of discrepancy because their experiences and your experiences, there is a lot of difference. So instead of getting confused, you go to the CIC website and then and you have they have a questionnaire and answers provided. So you can do that. CIC website. For transcript, I connected with my college, my college website to understand how I will get the transcript and all. This I got from British Council. I gave an offline exam so it took 14 days for my result to come.  So I submitted my documents. My college had sent me the link.. so here they have a Google form. They have that drive Google Drive on that you are supposed to submit the documents. CAQ also I was supposed to create an account on the website…on the government website. Plus, they mail you the letter. Post the letter.  So you have a physical copy. So what happens when they send you an electronic copy it can be editable. Here it is a certificate. So the certificate can be mishandled it can be edited and all. So they send a physical copy. So this copy is required at the airport, it is required at the immigration and all. When I landed, I have to show it at the airport then I was directed to the immigration section, because this is the permission. I used Facebook for understanding the city – city knowledge. Lot of information I got from Facebook for instance it is a historical place, regarding the weather, what are the different places in Montreal, how is the weather, how to cope up with the weather. They have videos which have been posted. There are hashtags. I use Facebook, Instagram, I follow the mtl blog. Im following the account of my college so I was pretty much updated about things happening other activities are happening in my college. I came here on 9th of  October so 1st of October they had a visit the college whichever student they had for June intake and all.. They took those students for a city tour so I got to learn about all this activities, extracurricular activities, colleges networking activities, that I came to know from their Instagram handle. So college and MTL blog – these are the 2 things that I am following. Plus I'm very much into yoga. So the people who are in this city who does Yoga and all, Im following their accounts and then this one thing I follow – Sri Ravi Shakankar – Art of living. This is one Instagram handle. So what they do they conduct a meditation and yoga session. twice in a week, like bi-weekly. This coming Sunday they have a session. So FB and Instagram is more than enough. WhatsApp – video and voice call. So instead of using Skype and all Whatsapp is really good because for Skype the other person needs to have it and all. With Whatsapp your phone is registered and off you go. You have Google Maps very much essential when you are traveling to other country and the city, the country from where you come, you have good transportation facility like train, you have cab you have rickshaws available. But it is not necessarily these facilities will be available in the other country. \n",

      "\n",
      "Si:\tSo this is self-funding then sponsored by dad. That’s it. Since he’s retired, he has his retirement fund so that is being utilised. Yeah lot of, umm, when I thought of studies like when I confirm with studies, I wanted to know the culture… like how is the technological culture in the city. So I enrolled to meetup. Yeah, went to this app …meetup app. On that I connected with Montreal Analytics team. Then I connected with women in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This is one community which is doing good work. We're working on this. So, these are the apps that keep on posting the meetups that they conduct. So these are the 2 groups. This is an NGO. So, when I'm when I'm in the city, and I don't have things to do on weekends, or whatever, I need to meet with people, I need to understand the culture I need to understand the technology space. So I'll be going to these meetups and I will be interacting with the people. Oh, that's this is that because Did you go to any meetups yet? Not as of now. I have like I said yoga. Yeah, art of living. So that is happening on Sunday 20th 20th of October. So I'll be going over there. But it also helped me to find out the relevant accommodations and all. Ill be meeting people who are already in Montreal. Students who are already in Montreal. They might help me out. For accommodation, what I have observed over here…whichever buildings are there, so they have already posted if there are vacant flats that are available in that building. So the posters are already available, you just scan the code and physical posters are there, you just scan the code and it redirects you to that website and you come to know if there are rooms available in this. You just connect with them or fill the form and then accordingly, they will reply. So maybe QR code will come somewhere and at the end here, looking for accommodation. So this is all before arrival. Now I can create a map after arrival. So for arrival I will start with airport. So at airport what was required is a token needed to be created that is a profile is created yeah profile of passengers are created. Then the next your CAQ is checked. Your visa is checked. You are redirected to Immigration Department. And then you get your visa permit, here you get your visa – after the immigration. You don't get a visa until you actually arrive. The work permit is after studies. The college mentions that since you are studying over here you can work part time so that is implicit. 20 hours a week. VFS just provided with the visa…visa number. See that is just a number. So, when you come to their country and whatever number you have, based on that number the immigration team understands that these are students, these for study, these are for work, these are for PR. Then they give you the documents. So I got a stamp saying student. So I got my study permit and I was out… out of the airport [laughs]. So very much clear process and staff is very cordial. You need to create your own profile. So there are 15 to 20 computers available. You can do it in five to seven minutes your token is created you after that you have two people who will be checking your certificate, the check it, they tell you to go to the immigration and immigration section there are seven to eight people desks, so even if there are 20 people, each persons check is done in 5 minutes. This is very good over here. They do ask… the immigration people do ask what is your accommodation? Where are you going to stay? Where are you going to go from here? So that is being checked – accommodation and address is checked. We call it as reference. So yeah this would go before. Submitted my file. Visa was approved in July. It takes 2 days to come from Delhi to Mumbai. So, after that I connected with my friends for temporary accommodation. So, I had two months – August, September. So it happened that earlier I was supposed to go to another place and there, there was no vacancy. And in September's first week, it was already occupied. So, then I had to search for another place. So eventually this is the 3rd friends room where I have a like, they accommodated me. 2 months it took me, like I was I was in a dicey position, like where I will stay, where I will stay.. Firstly I was searching for accommodation on Facebook, Kijiji app, Airbnb and all. But eventually I got it through a friend. Accommodation and then I got a cab, Because the address was already given to me. And from airport, this location, it takes 20 minutes. And then they came to receive me near the entrance of the building. Everything is on your mobile phone. Just imagine if you don’t have an internet connection, you are gone. I did my international roaming but I didn’t use the data services. So I did that now, like I got my college registration done, my bank accounts, Then I've got my phone, took another SIM card here and I hot my social insurance number also. I went first I went to the College. So, what I did, in one day itself I did everything - services. So, I had my college registration, in that same building, so college registration is on the first floor, Scotiabank at ground floor. Then there is mall over here. Eaton Mall.. there I took my SIM card, so which is like five minutes away – Sim card - and then I went to Service Canada for my sin number. So this all happened in a span of three hours. So that is the beauty of government working over your. Actually, this is on do in your country. In 2-3 hours, you cant do it. You need three days and all these places are very much nearby. Otherwise in my in my country or my city I need to travel from one place to another place. So, traveling is like 30 minutes, one hour, two hours. \n",

My Canadian work experience might add some points my Canadian studies will add some points. And if I get a score, and that score is as par with the CRS score, So I can get PR.

      "M:\tWould you have to marry an Indian person only doesn't matter where you?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Si:\tIt doesn’t matter and it didn't matter when I was in my country also. In fact it would be very good if I didn’t marry an Indian person [laughs]. Because when you are thinking of settling,  you have already taken a decision of moving from one country to another country. So your mindset is about exploring the places, so why not exploring relationships and why not exploring this aspect of your personal life also? Like, in my case, 33 half of my life I've spent in one country and didn’t do this… I was in a relationship and things couldn’t work out. So I couldn't take our decision to get married. So now, now, my mindset is here I have like, I don't have a burden of working. It is pretty much clear that I'm studying I have, so I will be having some time on the weekends. So it all depends upon my study schedule and how it is, I need to have, like, I have to say, in my bucket list, I have made sure that I'm going to go out and meet people, which I have not done in my work life, like for 10 years, or employed so that I have to do it over here, because what I feel is this is the one year which I've got. I've got it from my family as well as the opportunity I've got to understand myself and take a step on it. Tinder I have used in my country. It is of no use and the app has a very negative response and all. I don't know about other apps. On Facebook, you guys come to mobile lot of apps and all like, okay, okay. Okay. See the love that you have. But I don't want to rely on those apps. What I feel is if you start socializing, you start meeting new people like I have an opportunity to. I can meet someone in my college also. And I'm like, I'm a big fan of Shahrukh Khan. So I will tell you one experience Yeah. So like from I'm a die hard fan Shahrukh Khan. So before coming on the last day for my friend's birthday, they prepared one slam book. So the last page was Shahrukhs pic and my pic. So they had written a message that hope hopefully you will, you will meet him some day. So what happened when I went when I went to my college for registration, my college is at the first floor. So there was one guy. I just entered the lift so there was myself and two guys who live. So one of the guy he spoke to another guy, he said… he was greeting him hello. So the other guy told him Do you know me? He said yes, we met at Apple. So then he introduced himself, “I'm Shahrukh” [laughs]. So when he introduced himself he said “Im Shahrukh and Im from Pakistan”. And Im like Shahrukh!!! [Laughs]. After 10 minutes I just messaged my friend I said that you wrote in the slam book that I will meet Shahrukh and I met Shahrukh in my college. So you know Bollywood movies? So Shahrukh’s last movie was jab Harry Met Sejal. So in that, the tagline and what you seek is seeking you. [laughs] So, my friends, everyday they message me and say – did you meet Shahrukh? I am like, no I haven’t gone to the college again but I'm very much eager. So what happened after the lift… I went to my college and did all the process. Then I have one of my student is working over here. So he told me that why don’t you come to McDonalds? So, I went to McDonalds and Shahrukh had come to McDonalds as well. So I was telling my friends that you’ve written in my slam book and I have met Shahrukh. It is not Shahrukh Khan but it is Shahrukh. I am following him… not following him, like seeing him but he doesn’t know that this girl is looking at me.  So that gives me a high point over there okay fine. I can look around people and I can meet people and people oh you're a very positive, very cordial…like they speak… they are very friendly. Even at stores, I went to all the government offices and the life was very easy. Otherwise when you go to a government office in your country, first of all you feel scared then the second thing is you’re already scared, and then people don't talk properly. They talk rudely. And also First of all you’re scared, you're not that ready you take elder person from your family to go to the government office and then your attitude and their attitude dont match. So it's your family members always say that whenever you're going to a government office make sure you're taking an elder person who has very good high level of patience because its a government office. If you speak rudely and if you speak with your attitude, the work is not going to happen. So take someone who is elder and who has very good level of patience. That thing I didn’t observe over here. It was a good thing and I was little bit sceptical.. if they ask some questions that I'm not able to answer or it might happen I might get hyper and all. Even my family was amazed that in three hours you did all these things and that too being alone. Im like yes, I did it. [laughs]. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Si:\tMy family – I don’t think so they would be coming over here because my stay is, as of now, it all depends on my year one year of completion. Then again there will be an approval for the work permit. I have go through an approval process. So as of now I don't know, in my mind is only studies study like the one year of studies. Then our next I don't know like, if I'm calling my family what is the process and all …I suppose it is visit visa now. But again, again, there are some there must be some prerequisites for visitor visa and all. I have not given any thought about it and my family's also not thought about it. So that would be in future if I get a work permit again. What are the criteria for family coming to the country and all? No idea. \n",

      "Si:\tTouch wood - my flow was very much clear and it was step by step because when I see other people, like my roommates also, they had a very tough immigration process in India. So, they had their visa rejection also happened and all. So in my case, what I observed is they, they were not having that much knowledge. So, luckily, in my case what I did before applying even everything, I made sure that I have 75% of the knowledge regarding what I'm doing next. So, even I was thinking that 25% I might go wrong, but 75% I have a knowledge about this. This also.. the government work and all… I made sure that I read proper content and then I went to them, again French people in the offices, there were talking in French. So, I made sure that how to greet them in French. I made sure those I know those words their accent I need to understand and all what I observed when I went to Service Canada My name they pronounced in another way. Even there were people sitting so the pronunciation of the name was very much different so there were some two three people the name was called several times but they couldn’t understand that their name is being called. So its all like how adaptable you are  and how you're prepared… t\n",

      "\n",
      "Si:\tThe biggest challenge observed was in Frankfurt – in my layover. So my flight was delayed from Mumbai. So, I had a span of like 30 minutes to move from that, that section to my boarding session, so I had to run like anything. So I thought that Oh my God, if I missed this flight, what was going to happen? I didn't knew what what would be the next options and all and the funds are not there. So even in your country, if you could happen that you miss a train, a flight or a bus, you know that you have funds, you will do something about it. And no internet or no internet connection. And the mind was also not working like what am I going to do. Like, I met a guy. He helped me because he was also moving to that same gate. So he helped me. He helped me a lot into that. We both were running and all and like in 20 minutes I reached there. Even the airport staff, they were good. But they also couldn’t do anything because I had to run anyhow, I had to rush. That was the biggest challenge. Because at that time even thinking now is like if I couldn't make it in in that 30 minutes then what next. Those 30 minutes were like, something… Then when I was sitting in the flight I was thinking, what if I missed it. When I came over here and shared this with my family and my brother was like there is no problem. You are supposed to go to the airport authority the whichever like I came from, I took Lufthansa, So just go to their section. So then they will book another flight or they would have contacted India or they would have… like something could have been done. I was like this option, at that point, I wouldn't think of. And this was the first international flight so I never knew that this all options are there. So its good that I am moving out and when other members of my family will move, they are well equipped with all this possibilities. They also helped me a lot. And I'm like lucky that they knew that these all possibilities would come. So they were prepared with this and we were doing it because they also connected with their friends and they did the research and all. I was very much relying on my family that yes, if nothing could happen, yes, they are there they will help me anyhow and they will do it.\n",

      "\n",
      "So I tell my friends that I have a very progressive family literally, moving at this age, it is not at all possible. I have my friends who are single and they are also giving a thought about coming to like moving out of the country after working 10 years, 12 years,  they spoke with their family and they got a clear rejection. Its like you're not allowed to go. Its their mindset. They don’t want them to move out. Just because you're not married, you cant move out. Like two of my best friends, they are very much keen, not only to this country they're they're like… they wanted to move at least from Mumbai to somewhere else in the same country. But theyre not allowed. \n",

This all information, I would like to help others also, like I was telling my friends only. But their family is not keen. So I decided I would speak to them, but I will speak after two to three months and when they when they realize that, how happy and how I'm able to execute it. So it all depends upon how I face things over year and how I go from one level to another level over you, then they will get the confidence that yes they can send their daughter.M:\tSo firstly, let's just tell me when did you come to Canada first? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Da:\tOkay, so like if you're asking me exactly for vacations or you just want me to just tell you like exactly when I actually moved? So, when I'm came for vacation that was when I was maybe like 10 years old. Okay. was a long time ago. Right now I'm 22. So I'm guessing like the 2010. Yeah. And it's only for vacation. So we just came. So my mom, married. Sorry, my mom met this guy back in 2010. And he was in the in the business kind of thing. She went and met his boyfriend at that time. And then, like, they got a connection. And then they had like, it was like, sorry, my English is so bad. So basically what happened is like, they meet and then they start talking to each other. And then they have a really good deep relationship. So it was like a long distance relationship kind of thing. It was really good. I mean, we love the guy. I mean, he was really good with us. He was cool with her. And he always invited us to Canada. The first time I went to Canada, it was in Alberta, no, sorry, it was Qcebec. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Da:\tYeah. So he went for vacations. And my mom was going for a business trip. Oh, so they met in there and then they had a connection and it was awesome. Then they started like having going deeper in their relationship. And then we started going together. We went to Quebec as a family, my brother, me and my mom and him. And we went to a sister in Quebec, and it was amazing. I love that place. And we always have the opportunity to say like, this is an amazing country. We should live here right? Yeah. We never came across. It was only got like, kind of like a vacation kind of thing right. Then after that, when we came it was in Alberta, again with my mom and then I came with just myself. My brother, I think he stayed in Mexico. And that was in 2000… You're making me think…. long time. I think it was in 2012. We come back to Alberta. We went to Banff. It was beautiful. We stay there for a long time. And then after that, we came... My mom stay there from Mexico. We stay there for a little time. And then they decided to just get married. That was in 2015. So, after three years, they they after the relationship was good and everything. They broke up, I think, for one or two years. And that was like the gap of a few years they broke off and then they came back. And then he decided to say like, hey, like, you know what, let's get married. Bring Dante, bring everything. Let's just go there. And my mom asked me she was like, What do you think? And that was I was 17 by the time. So, it was kind of like a hard decision. Yeah. Like, it wasn't like kind of like, I was so excited. You know, like when they tell you 17 go to the new Canada and new country. And mean it was so good. And I love to, like, I loved this country. Like when I met them here, everything what I did and here in Canada when I was on vacation, I was like, Yes, I wanna live here. So yes, I came in 2015 when I when I moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo in terms of motivations behind your migration, like did you when you when your mom told you like, think of like, what are your thoughts like, what did you consider in your, in your personal sort of mind like in making that decision to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Da:\tSo one of the main problems was, I guess it was school wise. So because we don't we didn't know what's going to happen, right. I was in in high school at that time in Mexico City. Okay, so I was kind of like finishing in my second year of high school. I wasn't doing that great to be honest with you. Yeah. I wasn't doing great in school. At that time. I was like, mostly partying, you know, in high school, partying, friends going out and everything. So my mom told me like, it's a big decision, you know? She lost her job. So, it was a good thing for her. Like, she, she she lost it. So I'll tell you what was the behind of it. So my mom, she worked for a pharmaceutical for maybe 16 years. A long time. She got a good job and she got to pay. We live really good play with all the time was private schools in Mexico City. We got like a really good life. And my mom, she always worked hard for stuff. She was a lonely parent. And so she was it was really complicated for her right. But at the end of the day, she did it. She brought two kids. So both of us were really. Right now at this time, so I'm like she's proud of us and I'm proud of my mom. Right? And she was the main. She's the still one of my thoughts that she makes me keep going. right. Um, she, after she lost her job, it was so hard for her to actually find another job. So, because of her age, right, in Mexico City is really hard to actually find a job as a woman and as a as your age, right? Like, they don't take you seriously. My mom is an accountant and she has her degree. She was she's a professional worker. And unfortunately, she couldn't find a job. But she find a job good job. Like when she was in the middle of when she broke up with, with Frank, or with his ex-husband. And it was a good job too. And she she loved the job. She She liked it. And she was like, Well, I'm gonna stay here right? When this person actually offer us to go to Canada. It was a big deal too for her. There was a lot of problems. The thing is first, her job, then my school that was one of the important things because I'm 17 right so I have to go with her. It's not like a question on matter to say like, oh, you're staying here in Mexico and then I'll go there. No, it's like a family thing like to bring everything from there right? In Mexico for her was really it was like that's why she asked me because she told me like, well, you're not going to have school. You're going to finish your a year and then I might lose I'm gonna lose my job and here and also the problem was the house. She has a house she owns a house in Mexico, and it's with my my dad. Right? Unfortunately with my dad she always have problems with him. So it's kind of like…it was it was kind of hard and that time I guess. I'll say one of the motivations… that basically what you asked it was…we needed like a clean slate. I think we was an escape, you know. I think my mom was tired of it. She saw an opportunity to live with someone with… her love of life. And to bring me there. I think it was a plus too, right? I mean, I didn't say no, I just, I was so excited about it. I think I saw a great opportunity to be here. I mean, I even invested like, into my research and everything. And I thought, like, you know what, it is a good opportunity, you know what I mean? Like, I could finish school in there. I didn't thought that it was like, kind of like a much of a loss. But now that I think it is, we lost a lot of things… we lost…it's a culture wise. I mean, it was a change of culture. It was a change of people. It was a change, a family, it was change of everything that was surrounded by us, right. And it was just taken away. Right. Like, for me, my perspective was taken away and then just coming through the country, right. So yeah, I think that's that's one of the things that I don't know if I answer your question, but I don't know like\n",

Yeah, just, it's half my dad's and half hers. It is still like kind of a problem in there. I mean, my dad is he doesn't want to see any of us that he doesn't wanna see me, doesn't see my brother, See my mom. So it's kind of like, hard. I mean, I already forgave him so. So I really don't mind. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd professional background. So let's talk about professional mean, you moved here when you were really young, you still had school to do. So did you what type? Like what how did that sort of that translate into current professional life? What what happened from there? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Da:\tThe thing that I find most interesting in this in this country is that they don't accept anything that is from Mexico. So, so any any background or anything that you have or anything like that, it's just like zero. Like when you come here, it's just you start like again. Yeah, so when I came here to to Edmonton, I thought, like, okay, so I have in my high school, can you accept my two years and say, No, you have to do an exam. And then from that exam, we will put you somewhere. Unfortunately, when I went to high school in that time, I was 18. So I was 17 at that time when we moved in, but then I turned 18 right away, right. So in the laws in there and Edmonton unfortunately when you are a 18, you're not you're not a dependent, right? So the reason why we have to move that fast is because I had to be with my mom when 17. Right? Because otherwise they wouldn't take me. They wouldn't say like, No, he's an adult, he has to make his own application. So for the application, that's the whole reason why they took me when I was 17. Right. After when I was 18 in there, they don't accept any high school students. Thankfully, I don't know how but like my like how the school was in Mexico. It actually like my level. It wasn't that bad. I was like, almost finishing. When I came here, I did my high school, maybe one year. I didn't finish high school. It was an option. The reason why is because I saw an opportunity and I plan it. My plan was to basically to only finish the courses that I need to go to college right? from college, go to university. That was my whole point and my mom agree with it. And even her husband agreed, Right. And he was like, Yeah, that's a great idea. I mean, and I was going to the trades kind of thing. environment. And that's the whole reason why I took that that path, right? unfortunately didn't work. It didn't work as well as I thought but yeah, like I did. I only have I don't have my high school diploma. But I have the like, the knowledge of it, basically. So I have the courses to actually go to college? If I want to go to college right now, I can, because in here the system… they only asked you for something. Like if you have math and English passed… then you can go to college. You don't need to have a high school diploma. Right. You only need a high school diploma if you want to go to university, right. So in my thought it was like, at that time, I was thinking about the price, right? So university’s really expensive. Yeah, right. So I was thinking so I can get college. And then once I go to college, then I can go to I can pay less. Then once it pay less, and then after the year and I become a permanent resident and everything, I will pay less for university. So on time being, I can actually be in college and then go to university. So that was a whole point. So that was the that was my thinking, right? Go to college, pay less. And then after I have my degree or something, I will go to university. It was a good plan at the time. But like, if you're asking me for any professional background, I don’t have any. \n",

      "Da:\tSo how that happened? So basically, in the bank, they don't ask you for for that. They don't ask you for high school diploma. So and it's about experience and much more about customer service. I think I learned a lot. I have a lot of experience. And that's what actually taught me. I've been working in the customer service …in the industry for a long time. And I think I know how to do it Good. I guess sometimes when I don't know if you heard that before, when people they tell you like, you don't need education for actually be successful. And, and it is true. I mean, it's about how you have a connection with people and how you actually can interact with them. Right. So I learned that and it been helping me for a long time, right. So yeah, and I was actually trying to go to do the school. My thinking is still going to school because I do still want to go to school. Next year, I'm planning to go to school… to university or to college. Well, first to college and and you know, right so, but I'm still debating which where to go right. \n",

Was was that all sort of that taken care of by your mother? \n",

      "Da:\tIt was actually really fast. It was in a one year period. Because my mom plan it really good with him, okay, and they plan it in a way that we can actually move together as a family. Right. So it was not a big planning on my on my way. I did, I have to do a lot of things right. Like I had to finish a lot of things in Mexico City. I had to finish my degrees in there from high school before I actually leave, my passports I have to do all I have to do all by myself, because my mom was working at the time. So I actually helped my mom to do all those kind of like, paperwork, paperwork. And she was she was she needed the help. So she was so happy about that. Right. I helped her for a lot of things, because most of the things were in English, so I had to translate for her and I did explain her and detail what actually the things they need. Mostly we did them… I think it we would have planned in, we wouldn’t be here if I if I'm honest with you. If we wouldn't make that rush decision, I don't think we would’ve been here. The non-planning worked, I think, I think in in this sense yes. Because if we would have seen maybe like in, in a long term kind of thing, I think we, I would’ve said no. Or my mom would say no too. After all that we have struggled. And after all that we have seen and what we've gone through, I think I would say no. And my mom, the same. I think we would be better in Mexico. \n",

Their relationship was good. Everything was amazing. Like we went to trips together. He came to Mexico. We have always good time. We have fun with him, right? I even see him as a dad sometimes, right? Like, I did like him and it hurts me because he's now that I think about it. It's just like, I lost two father figures, right? Like one that I like, my my dad that doesn't recognize me as a son. And then the other one…that I thought, I could have a dad and then it just got taken away, right. So basically what happened is like after a year, we live in there. It was a struggle with him. I guess the reason why I think he lost, he lost his job in Edmonton. So he was living by his pension, and he just got divorced recently, too. And then he lost half of his money right with his ex-wife. So everything was really tight with him, like with kind of money wise. At the beginning it wasn't. At the beginning, everything was perfect. Like maybe the first four, three months. It was really good.  I didn't complain when my mom didn't complain or anything. But we thought that we had a future in there with him. We were planning, like planning about all these things… school, I was planning about my school, I was planning for a lot of things. Then it got to a point where money was one of the main problems. So I had to start working. I work as a bartender back in Edmonton. First as a busboy, you know, bussing tables, and my manager loved me. So, all the servers love me too. They love the way I interact with clients. So, they told me Hey, you want to be a bartender? I was like, Yeah, for sure. So, I started being a bartender. I love that job. I love the people that I met in there it was so nice. I I was feel at home. I met some… so good friends in Edmonton and I still talk to them. I mean, I miss them. My best friends I ever had. Then after that, we lost... He was getting into a depression kind of mode. Because he was at home every day. So because he doesn't have job doesn't have nothing to do, right. So he was getting into that mode and he was really, really depressed. It got to a point that like food, like it was the even shorter. Like literally he was basically like, no, like, you can't eat that much. Why you eat that much? Like, you’re wasting money, you're wasting this and it was always a struggle. My mom didn't like that either. My mom she suffer a lot with him I say…just just going back you just reminded me like, How does she like deal with it? Right? So when they married, my mom did everything for love. She… She didn't expect anything back. She didn't do anything. Like, she didn't want anything. Like back she didn't want any money. Nothing right. She even signed a prenup for him. So if anything happens like she would never have it, right, that's how much she loved, right? Unfortunately, like we didn't knew about this…because we trusted him. But he did something like inside that… basically said like, you cannot have anything like, like it was it was really bad, that prenup. So we got into the point that my mom was trying to just suck it up just for me. So, she was thinking like Okay, I'm gonna suck it up for a year and then we can stay here, we get the papers and then we can figure out something out. This is for the permanent residence because we apply as a sponsorship.  So he was our sponsor for me and my mom. Yeah. And basically, that's that's what happened, right? So then, it was really, it was really hard like my mom and him they never speak. My mom sometimes had to sleep in floor and had to do some stuff. She was.. she didn't like.. She always… she's she's a happy person, right? So she always go out to, always go out to be like, you know, I'm gonna go out she did. She loved working with kids, so she even volunteered for that. And she'd go out and help kids and everything right? I always go to work, school. I was doing part time, and part time, at the time. And I was really I was doing really good. I was focusing on my studies and I was looking after my work too. I loved it. I was really good in English in Edmonton and I was really surprised. I was like, wow, like, I was like, Wow, really, really good. And that's, for some reason. I was like, wow. In Mexico I was really bad but now in Canada, I'm really good for some reason. What happened? [laughs] you know. But yeah, after that, then he decided to… One month…he was like, kind of, like suspicious kind of away. So he, he was like, basically telling my mom like, threatening her like, you know what, Im gonna cancel the visa, Im going to cancel the papers. We never thought about that. I even told my mom, she would ask me like, can he do it? and I was like, “yes, he can, but I don't think he would. So, one day he comes, and I think ie was like, mostly the economical stress and maybe the depression that he has, because he was looking for a job at that time and he couldn't find it. Like he wanted the same pay and the same things and you would never get something because he didn't have like the diploma. So, like experience unfortunately, doesnt pays you off. That's why I want my papers [laughs]. You know, unfortunately, But yeah, I mean, one day he came in, he just said, so I cancelled the papers. So he didn't even tell us nothing. Apparently, he cancelled it one week before. He was going to the lawyers and he cancelled the whole sponsorship. So he literally went to the thing. And then we've been checked online, we called and they say “yeah, your sponsor just cancelled the application”. So, the case has been closed. So, there's no way that we can help. Because as the rule in Canada once a sponsor cancels, unfortunately, they once they close that file, that’s it. They move to the next one. It is sad. I mean, just like it makes me feel like sometimes they protect more them, their own people than actually us. Right Like as an immigrant…we don't… we didn't came here to do a bad thing. I mean, we were productive. I mean, I was working. My mom was working. My mom…like as a as an accountant, professional accountant, she had to do cleaning floors and everything. Right? We came here we gave everything up from Mexico City just to come here and do all that type of work that we will never came into.. cross our minds, right? So I feel bad about that too for my mom too, because I'm like, all the hard work that you did everything, all the money that you make and everything and it's just for you to start to just working as a cleaning and she was like, I don't care. Like, I'm proud of it. I mean, that's, that's why I love my mom, right like she. Shes just happy. Yeah, so, I mean, and unfortunately, he didn't actually help us out. Because it wasn't like I don't feel like it was like, like he didn't protect us. Like, I feel like in that thing. Canada needs to actually focus on those people too because just by like a snap of a finger, someone just can tell you know, you can go back to your country. \tSo it was 2015. He cancelled the papers in 2016. So, in November. So it was basically because you need two years of sponsorship and then you get the PR. So he cancelled it after a year yeah, so he cancelled…that's what I mean it's just like doesn't make sense to me …like someone… and then like he was even so funny because even actually bought the tickets because he actually like, kicked us out of the house because…he literally, one day he's like here is tickets from Mexico City. I don't want you in my house. You have a month leave. I already bought the tickets. That's it. So yeah, so that's what I mean when they when they ….they don't realize people ….they don't realize… like how easily someone can just ruin someone's life and then just decide.. just not to do it. Right. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Da:\tSo we went to a lawyer.Yeah, for sure. We went to a lawyer because we were scared. We didn't know what to do. And my mom, thankfully, she had, she knew a lot of people at that time. So they connected her to them. And she knew a really good lawyer and thanks for her Thank you her! Like, she actually went for it. So, the funny part about that, the lawyer thing of like, the thing that you asked, it is like the system in here is just, it doesn't make sense. Some lawyers, they just give you they just tell you, okay, you can come here, we will charge you this. And they tell you things that …they're not true. They give you misinformation. Most of the lawyers. Thank god this person my mom know her and she was… she knew a lot of cases so my mom she's really careful with that right so she's like okay so because we try others too and they were like, No. And they basically tell us like… no you have to go to your country. You have no options, you have to go. Like you can apply… you don't know English, they are not going to give you an opportunity… Your age is not going to be enough points to actually work for Express Entry. Right? And for me, they told me Yes, he can do it but he has to go to school. He has to start working and once he starts to work after school, then he can apply. And so me and my mom, we decided like you know what, if that happens, then we started saving money. We started saving money for for my school, and then we start saving money for her too in the future, right? Mostly my mom did it for me, for my school because we knew how expensive is going to be the school. Right? And yeah, like, it's just lawyers in here in Canada, they don't actually help you. And that's one of the main problems I think in everywhere in every province and every city, there's one out of 10… that they actually want to actually help you. And they care about what they're doing. Because most of them, they just want….they just want the money, how we're gonna pay them. And then if it gets accepted, that's good. If it doesn't, next. So, I feel bad because I'm one of the lucky ones at least, I got the good advice from a lawyer. And even though like lawyers are so exhausting, like we have to be in the back of them all the time, because they don't do their work. And that's what I told to my mom, you know what, you were paying her money. You need to actually to… Like the word is not claim. Its like demand… You have to demand her to do her job. It's her job but and you're paying for her. Its not like a free service. If its free, okay, I understand. But, they told us… like we never heard about that option.. the humanitarian option. After we explain our story to the lawyer, she was like, you know what, you qualify for doing a humanitarian visa, as a humanitarian basis and you can apply as a PR. She even told us like, it is rare that these cases, that they get accepted. So, it has to be a really hardship… like a really hardship thing that happened to you that they will accept it. Otherwise, they'll not accept it. So we said right. Yeah so that was by the lawyer.\n",

      "Da:\tOh my God. You know, all these communities in here, they're the horrible thing ever [laughs]. They are, I will say in Toronto, they're the laziest person that you will ever met in your life. All community. My mom went to all different type of communities to have some help. And nobody would help her.. like Spanish. Most of them were like Spanish. She asked for legal advice, because she needs to divorce with that guy, right. She asked for legal advice mostly, because she wanted to get the divorce. And even for to ask for the papers and we're doing actually the right thing…the humanitarian basis… they were like No, he's a Canadian, you're an immigrant. You're not gonna get anything, they're not gonna help you out. He has the right. That's basically what we got from a community center where we're supposed to actually help each other. And it makes me mad because he's just they’re people that… they're actually getting paid by the government, that they are not doing their job. They are not actually helping. And it's just, it is unfortunate because I seen it even when I work in the bank. I've been trying to reach this communities to actually help immigrants and me I will myself I want to help them out to do their banking, but they don't.. They just don’t wanna do it. I I really think that community centres, with the government, I think they're stupid, like, I mean, like, I mean, they should not be actually there. I mean, they should not be there. So waste of money. taxpayers money. It is a waste of money. All my friends.. they are immigrants. My friend Kosta, he's from Spain, he went through the same situation, okay. Well, not the same. But he, unfortunately he came when he was 18. So, they didn't give him the papers with his parents. So his parents got Express Entry because they were professionals and everything and they were from the UK. So right away, they get into the permanent residence. But like he was 18, so they didn't give it to him. So unfortunately, no, but we're talking to each other and like, we were mad …we were were even I remember when I was, like, we're even talking about how stupid the system is and how unfortunately for people that like us who actually want to work and want to contribute, and actually not use any of their taxpayer money, which they complain a lot, we actually want to be in this country to work and to do something productive. Unfortunately, they don't give it to us. \n",

      "M:\tNow you told me the visa processes and everything. You know what we can pretty much move on to the map. One last question before that. In terms of skilled migrant. I mean, like I said that this research is about being skilled or skilled. How do you consider yourself to be skilled?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Da:\tso um, I think for the last two years, I learned a lot in the bank. Even though I don't have a paper that says that I'm a skilled worker, I think I am. I'm a personal banking associate. I deal with a lot of thing… I deal with lots of credits, like credit card applications. I deal with a large amount of money too with clients and I think I'm like my boss loves my job like I think I've given them so well that they're happy with. Like I don't get no complaints from any of my bosses so not my boss. He doesn't have no complaints. I have… I have an attitude problem but that's different case. When he doesn't go my way, I get frustrated.. I get like an attitude problem but I think that’s the sassy part of me. So the most proudest thing than I am is for learning languages. So I learned… in a period of one year I learned French so I'm now with speak French and I speak English and Spanish on the level of a local person. And I'm proud of that too, to be honest. Because I learned it by myself. I didn't learn in school, I just learned by myself and I used to speak with my French clients, they love me too. I always talk to them. They're so nice. And also, I think I one of the main things, I think, and it's, I think it's a skill, because I want to be part of the community to help them. I've been trying to reach for a lot of community centres. I've tried to be part of the LGBTQ community, they’re HIV positive too...some people then to help them out for the banking because a lot of refugees that they come in here, they don't know where to go, and they go in there, and then they help them out. So, I try to help them out here, right. So, I'm being trying to be part of these communities. But for some reason they put so many reviewers, so they don't trust you and they think that they want that you want something out of them. And at the end of the day, I'm like, like I told them… I even tell them I don't get nothing from this. I can give my clients based in there, and that's it, right? Like, I don't need you right there. I don't need to do my work. But I do it because I want to be part of the community, I want to help you guys out. Because I think people are really misinformed. And people are not getting what they actually want to and what they need. So I think that's a skill to I think, like, I learned that I don't want people to go through the same situation with me or my mom, where they just tell you what to do what to do, and they don't have the option. Right? Like, I hate that. Like, it pisses me off if someone tells you like, yeah, you have to do this and this and that. And they don't explain you details. For me, that's, that's like, like, that's disrespectful because it's like you're you're someone your person, and you deserve to actually have options and you deserve to actually be to know what's going on. I mean, it's your money and its your things and you have the full right to actually know everything. So, I always do that to my clients and I try to do that for them. So, I'm proud of that. \n",

      "M:\tso firstly, let's go through all the visa categories you went through from the first point of arrival to the current status, including any wait times, processing times…\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Da:\tYeah, I have to think about, all right. I have So many visas in Canada as I wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think the first one would be my first visa. So I got my student visa first. student visa. so I got my student visa, student visa and that was seen back in 2015. Okay, okay, as a sponsorship. So when you have a sponsorship. When this is the sponsorship, you can get the visas really fast. I got my student visa the time so even though you're under the sponsorship you needed a student visa is …so basically this is not a visa being sponsorship. When you are being sponsored, they give you those visas in order for you to wait to the way to permanent residency. They give you those visas and then after that, then you can work and study whatever. Yeah, so I got the student visa. And that was me before I got I came here. So it took maybe like 3 months period…Give or take. Yeah, when I came here in 2015 when I moved there. So that was the first visa that when I got here. After a year, I was still in the sponsorship thing. So that was in 2015. I'm just saying I'm just wondering because I started working. So I was in school for a year. Yes, those 2016 So, in the gap of the sponsorship, I was still there. I went for a working visa, work visa. But this one, same, you took three months. Like it's a give or take, I think they given to me a little bit faster, because I was in the sponsorship. So when you're in sponsorship, they give you things way faster. Because you like when they have someone that can get in touch you like to be in the back of it. Then it makes it makes the process faster for some reason I don't know why. This was in 2016. I wanted to work. So I was like, you know, what I'm going to work for that time me until I get the PR. So I was thinking that and they say yes, that's…that's a great idea. After that, they just cancel my papers. So, this was in September. When I go my working visa go to the same time, I think August or September. So I got that in August. So this is when I was in the sponsorship. Then this is the sponsorship. Yeah, after the 2016. So when I was in, in December and December, it came here…December November it was time gap I got so my papers got cancelled. But, by the time that work visa was still valid, so I can still use that working visa, no problem. So even if they cancel your sponsorship, the working visa is still valid. So it wasn't it wasn't a problem after that. So December, once it was cancelled, it was fine. It wasn't a big deal. So then we went to the lawyer. And then she started the humanitarian process. They wanted to put that too. Yeah. So all these. So in that time, because we knew that he cancelled he was in November in December. So because its not a visa, so these things …like the sponsorship and the humanitarian, it's a I don't know how to explain it. It is like a process. But it's not an actual visa and it doesn't give you status. It doesn't give you nothing. It's just like, like, you apply for it. That's it, basically. So because basically, they give you your permanent residence as a humanitarian basis, or they give you your permanent resident as sponsorship, or they give you your permanent residence as a work skill as a skilled worker, or an express entrant. So that's how it works. Then I went to the humanitarian and that was in December 2016. That was when the process got started. Yeah, that's like a timeline. And then after that, I got my work permit until (checks phone) So I have the exact dates. And with the humanitarian, you can remain in the country though. That's what they were explaining us, like, as long as you have your working permit, they cant take you out of the country. If you don't have your working permit, then they will ask to leave right away. So, I have this one. They give you a lot of working permits. They ask you a lot of papers like it's because in that process if you like, do you want to know what actually they asked me? My working permit got expired so I had to apply. So, at that time I was working in the butcher shop. So, this time, during the time I will start working in the warehouse and so at this time, I was working in the butcher shop. And then I was working also in the warehouse. So my work permit was perfect and, and everything and… I was afraid because they might not give me my working permit at that time because any of these jobs are not skilled, right? and if they don't accept the humanitarian basis they don’t give you the working permit. You are making me think a lot of things. Coz in that time I got a letter of acceptance. I was still working the butcher shop, but that's fine. Then in 2017 in August, so when I was here… August 2016, I started working at the bank. So my my boss, actually, like, offered me the job. And then I quit that job. And then I stayed in the butcher shop. And then from this one I went to here and then to the bank. It's actually not that bad. And then when I was in the bank in 2017, I actually asked for a work permit. So, they asked me for a lot of things and then they say yes, so in that time, my working permit expired in August and gave it to me because I apply. So it was started working at the bank and then at that time, I have to apply for my my working permit and my working permit. They gave it to me in like after, like after three months, too. So when we knew about the working permit was accepted. We thought that so the lawyer told like if they accept the working permit, it means that they're going to give you the permanent residence, or it means that your humanitarian processes going in a good direction. So I remember I'm not 100% sure, but I remember that in this period of time in 2017. Because this is 2017. So, this is like in January, like in January, sorry. January to May - And then in this period of time, I remember that we got a letter, a letter that said that they will accept the humanitarian basis and that they will and they will actually like go through the process of it, but that doesn't mean that you're accepted. That's what they tell you. So that's, that's the intention of accepting it. Like, we will review this file as a humanitarian basis. But we don't know if you get approved for the permanent resident or as a humanitarian. So we got the letter of of …I will put it like letter accepting, accepting humanitarian…and then after that, yeah, I think that's most of the visas. Yeah, that's all I got. Yeah, it was a student and work visa and then another work visa and then I got another work visa actually action. Okay, so the work visa, because they gave it to me in 2018 because it expired. It was for only one year. So yeah in 2018 of July, so it expire at that time. So in July 2018 yeah because they give it to me for for one year….apply for work permit and it was three months this one.. and it was an open working permit as well.. that’s important. Because they give you restrictions so this one…. that the one that I had for this work visa [before], it only gives you a certain way you can work into certain in a specific places so you cant work everywhere. It gives you restrictions and their conditions in all of the work. And this one was with conditions. And they were saying that I know you can't work at this, we can all look at that. So I got the July 2018 …for the open and they they gave it to me for for two years. For the two years, when I knew about that, even my lawyer told me like you know what, you are going to get accepted for the permanent residence because that's how long it takes for them to give you your permanent residence. And it's true. So my permanent residence I even got it. They give you a PR card. So my PR – I got it on July 2019. So you see, like, it's, it is a whole… I'm sorry, like its a really bad map. \n",

      "M:\tSo we'll move on to commercial services that you use, right. So in terms of on your map itself, can you tell me the commercial services, the things that you paid for to get your PR?\n",

      "\n",
      "Da:\tSo for that one we didn't pay for the my step… my..my mom's ex husband. He paid I don't know how much to be honest with you…for the sponsorship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I have spent a lot of money. Mostly most of it, I would say would be almost like 30,000 for me and my mom. $30,000…that included, that's included the lawyers and I think I would be even more. So sponsorship, you pay for the student visa and my moms working visa. So I'm just gonna put my working visa (mom). Then there is a price as lawyer so…lawyer…that's another expense. What are they actually the charging for that they fix their own fees… I don't know how much you pay ..But like I say I'm pay for lawyers, the student visa and the working visa. So after the sponsorship when I did the humanitarian, we had to give $5,000 just for the application process. So the five thousand dollars he was the application process and that was not guaranteed, right. So it was just to start the process. We had to give the half of it. So one half first. And then the other half when we finish. My mom talked with the lawyers and she said ill pay that. That’s only the lawyers fees .. that’s only for the humanitarian itself, right. So this is only for this kind of thing. But then they charge you for other things, right. They charge you for the working visa for me and my mom, and then they charge you for the translation. So that's all the translation for all the documents like cards, anything that you have any like proof, any school or anything that I think it was least $1,000 coz it was my moms and mine.  I'm not gonna give him like exact numbers, but that's what I think it was the estimate. It really expensive, because they charge you by page. The other thing…the government fees…course because it doesn't come included with the government fees just to apply. They charge you just to put your information in so much then they charge you I think like $300 that is actually expensive because you're going to pay for a working visa, but they will charge you to have a right for visa basically. All right. That's for humanitarian.. I think I paid even more even more for that. Because we moved in here, we have to like pay the like the sending of documents. So when we send the documents the government, we also have to pay for that. So, the shipping of documents. So basically the lawyer will make all your file and everything they will stamp they make everything and then you send it to the government. So it's not online.  So we have to pay for those because they want actual copies of everything. So we have to pay for those shipping documents and makes it expensive because it's important documents… we don't want to make it lost because Canada post is the worst that you will ever have. I will never use Canada Post in my life. So you have to send it by UPS or FedEx basically. I think it's like 75 bucks just for sending documents. when I was in here….in Toronto….Ill say accepted process. I had to pay for my working permit. I also pay for the shipping because I had to send it to my lawyer. This lawyer was based in Edmonton. There's a process online - Yes, but  because this is humanitarian, they have to make the case. So the lawyer makes like a big huge case for you like 20 pages or something like that. And then they explain why you should take care, why are we actually applying. So I did take my medical, medical exams - you have to pay for blood testing and everything. They don't give it to you for free. So, it's blood testing is expensive. Why? I mean, it makes no sense. Then the right right to having this card [PR card]. It was $500. Just to have the right of being a permanent residence, you need to pay 500. They make money. That's why…that's why… I don’t understand because people tell me like “you leave from taxpayers money. Yeah, I wish I could see that money. Where is that money? because I don't I haven't received it yet. What else - fingerprints, prints from Mexico and from here. I have to be that from Mexico and from here so I think for me just to send them to Mexico, it was like hundred. She was like, just to send them and then I have to do the process. It's just too much work that that police think that it was because they want to make sure that they make a background check and everything and then they send it to the country and in the country. They send them to whatever the embassy That's right. So fingerprints, both of them because you have to do it twice…Fingerprints and background check. I think that’s it. I think it's more but I don't remember. \n",

      "M:\tWe'll move on to the next question. So tell me the role of technology. Did you use technology in your migration journey at all? Did you use any sort of online resources to conduct research on social media? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Da:\tYeah, I think that we did but it is horrible. Online, the experience is horrible. Our case for some reason it wouldn't show online so we were like in blind form because they don't tell you anything… like normally they say in the website… they say that you can check even on your phone. They give you two options either you go to through phone channel – it takes hours – or online. The problem with online is that our case for some reason in never like…. never like existed in their system for some reason. I don't know why it was just like, wandering around for some reason. So yeah, somewhere. I mean, I hate that online. And I hate the phone chat. I think they're not... When they get them hold of you. They're really nice. And then they give you really good customer service. I have to admit that, but they don't give you no information. They even tell you like we're not gonna give you any information on the trial, you have to wait until actually respond to you, like we're not gonna give you any information at all. The online it gives you a lot of research. But to be honest with you, it's scary to do it by yourself because you can do it you can do the application yourself. Even the government says you can be yourself like you just pay for it and then that's it. But it is a scary because if you miss something, if you use anything, like you say something wrong, or you don't know what actually that question actually means or anything like that - Denied right away and then they give back. So, is it worth it. Might as well just do it the right way and then just from a lawyer, because I see people and I know people that they have actually done it online. They're working permits, they take it online. And they do it by themselves. Like their permanent residence or their working permit. They do it by themselves. So, it's actually interesting because I was like, well, I should have done it, but I feel like it was safer. I'll say….this one none of them work. I hate them. I hate I just hate him like, this is so hard.  So the CIC website - that's one of the main pages and it tells you everything… it gives you. Like, just like, it doesn't give you like an explanation of why you have to do this. I mean, it tells you the time and everything. But it tell them in their own way. Okay, you have to wait this period, this time. But its like, Hey, can I know more? Like what do I have to do with that time? do I have to do anything else or what? So this was like no. My mom did did Facebook. There's like a community for latinos. They they talk about it or something like that. We didn't went through that. I don't think there's that much like online resources.\n",

      "M:\tTell me about your thoughts on immigration policies on current…Are you kind of on top of it? Do you keep a check on what what immigration is doing? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Da:\tUnfortunately I dont agree with any of the immigration policies that they have in this country or any where. So it might sound really bad but I think they're not fair…. they're not fair with how they select people and then how they accept people and unfortunately like we live in the world like a lot of people they have to leave their country not because of that’s what they want but because they don’t have another choice because their home it's been bombed or their home is being ….they're being threatened…. their kids are being threatened. And I understand that. I completely understand that. I mean, I think…I think that…for instance, I do not agree about the refugee stand for the Syria. Okay so the reason why is because the way they treat other people way better than us.. the actual immigrants, right? Basically, what the government is trying to make me understand is like so if youre actually having all this trouble and everything will give you everything. They give him the housing, they give them clothes, they give them all these resources to help them out to go through this life in Canada. Whereas the other parts ….where ‘us’ when I go into this category – Its like “no we don’t care, you need to pay and you have to figure out a way”. So, like in my my case, and a lot of people that I know… it's just not… I don't have nothing against their country or anything. It's everything like that…they can have everything so easy in the silver plate, but they don't realize how fortunate they are. is not the fact I understand completely. It's not a fact, I completely agree. They should actually give more help to them. And we should support. It doesn't make sense that you're helping all these other people and then just forget about the people that actually are contributing to your economy and are giving you money for that and we're not using any taxpayers money, or any we're not using any money or resources from any of the government. And at the end of the day, they really treat us like, like, “Okay, thank you. Thank you for coming”, you know. I even even see skilled workers, all the things that they have to go through, all the money that they have to pay. My friends, I’ve seen them - the scare of actually going back to your country because you don't actually perform in this country because they will you know, they see no, you can stay here because you don't qualify for it. I'm like, I'm thinking to myself like it is… like, how I'm not qualifying for it?, Like explain to me, how im not ‘qualifying’ for having to live in this country? I pay my taxes. I've been here for a long time and being a contributor for this society. I think and being part of here. I mean, it's not fair that you give priority to other people, just because your government and the choice of the people decided to do that. This is not even their fault. I'm not saying it's their fault. There's nothing to do with that. I mean, a lot of people they might thim im really.. a lot of people might not like my way of viewing things but its just like…its not fair to the person that he has worked so hard and then people like that the people like this… they going through that situation as a refugee, they don't appreciate what they really have. Sometimes its stupid… sometimes people like, they think they deserve everything in a way that and they show it to us like no I just. I'm not gonna work. I already have this. I have that… and I'm like that must be nice. I mean, like the refugees… they got greeted by the Prime Minister,they gave them clothes and everything - I didn't get anything. I didn't get any clothes. I have to buy my own. I didn't get any money. I have to actually pay taxes. I didn't receive any money back. I earned a lot of money for the government, just because I was working two jobs. Which makes no sense. I was like, in makes really no sense. Like how the government is actually doing this. Like, so what are you saying? Like, okay, so you have to work so hard to be in this country. You need to pay your lawyer. You need to pay your housing. Rent is not cheap here. You need to pay for your food. You need to pay for your normal expenses. And if it's something left to have a little bit treat for yourself, then you can have it. But then you see other people that they use the system. And I’ve seen it for long and I'm not saying it's only Syrian people. A lot of South American people do the same thing. And it's just so frustrating and its so, so like, like, it's just it makes me so mad. Because it's like, you have no idea what you have. Like they're giving you the opportunity, take it. Not everyone gets that opportunity. And that's what a lot of people don't understand. You know how many people actually want to be in a place where people are actually suffering back in their own back in their country, who are actually having a struggle. And then they come here, and they don't do anything. That makes me mad, because, at least at least in here, and what I have to say for myself is like, this space haven't been, it wasn't easy. At least I'm proud to say like, you know what, I'm a Mexican. And I came here to actually do something with my life and I actually work and I contribute to the economy. I am proud to be in this community and whoever told the opposite, that would be like no.. I do the same things as you. Because I see it with my partner. He's Canadian. So he has that conservative mentality that immigrants take everything.  Well, my ex partner… we just recently broke up. It's just because most of the people they say the same things. The same old comments that immigrants are taking their jobs or taking their, their opportunities, they're taking their money. And I'm like thinking like, No, that's not true. Like, the only reason why I had the job in the bank because Canadians don’t want that job. I mean that job is there.. I mean, we're the same.. I don't have enough experience. What is the difference between me and other Canadian? We have the same thing.\n",

So now just need only two years for citizenship. Which makes no sense. So I mean, like, I've been here four years in this country, you can't give me my citizenship right now? So there's a there's a test. Its like history most likely. They make you sing the national anthem and I think you have to pay for it too. I think it's another $500.\n",

And they give opportunity to other people that they should not be here. For instance, they should not take everyone.. you know what I mean? I think it and it's not about their background is not about their religion, it's not about anything. It's like they if you don't want to be part of this community are you doing here? If you don't want to get used to this culture, you don't want to be part of this culture. What are you doing here because culture is one of the main things and one of the main things that my mom and her ex-husband told me is like, you’re coming here, you change your culture. You're not Mexican, you're not. You're a Canadian. You're not celebrating any Mexican culture. You're not going to celebrate anything like that because you're in Canada. You're not in Mexico. And you know what? I agree. I say, You know what - you're right. If you come to my country, I will say the same thing, because you're in my country, you come here. And of course, I don't wanna, if im in Mexico, I don’t wanna celebrate Canadian holidays, right? It makes sense. I was like, Yeah, but unfortunately, a lot of people they don't like… they don't get that. They want to change the culture here. Which I don't agree with it because it's not.. Like why am I making this culture to change? What am I giving to this culture to telling you know why you need to celebrate my Mexican holidays?

This opened my eyes for some people. A lot of people they helped me with this and it's people that they're my clients people that they’re still my clients. I think I got maybe…. they don't give you an estimate of how much you need to help…. but the lawyer says that the many you get the better right because them…. for the government it says like you were part of the community and then they know you. They know you. And I got so many beautiful letters from people that I just met …just one day and I asked for a letter and they say yes, like So nice people like I mean, and they're all from here, from Cabbagetown. I mean, a lot of people they say they say, it might sound stupid, maybe because it's just a letter. But it just opens your eyes. Right? Like, I mean, I'll show you one it's, it's, it's just beautiful. How people are. I just love… I love that's the whole reason why I love customer service because this is it gives you a better understanding of people. Right? So this is one of my my clients from the butcher shop. I just talked to… She's so nice, and she gave me this amazing letter. And it's just beautiful. How actually people express about you just by knowing you for a little while. I love it. I have more. They did handwritten letters too. It's just beautiful. How many people they actually open their, their way and they see something because that's what they told me is like, you know what, I see something for me, and then I see that you are going to be great in this country and then you deserve to be in this country. I'm like, thank you. So they asked you for banking statements. So for the humanitarian base, they asked me for the all your banking statements so basically all your banking history….you have you had a credit card, and your personal banking because you need to prove how you been paid. How you pay your credit cards. How many loans you have, taxes – that’s the most important thing. How do you pay your taxes? and it has to be every year so every year, But I will put you in there like this is the most important thing for me was the letters. Yeah, letters, I think. I think it opens the eyes. It makes the officer making the application makes understanding of who you are, right. I got letters from restaurants or letters from people, we got letters from from …from my My brother's bosses. I go letters from my bosses and hearing the bank to say yes for sure I'll write a letter for you. I don't mind. Its so nice right? I can't I just can't believe I went through that was just like it is it is a hard process. Like sometimes I like I told you right in the beginning, like I feel like if I would have stayed in Mexico, like I told you, if I would have known all of this, I wouldn’t have come.  I'm not gonna say this. I think it's like all the experience that I have in here and made me learn a lot of things. I think I'm more mature and a lot of things. I got a good job. I got a lot of people that help me support me and then being together with me how I got closer with my family even closer with my mom and closer with my brother. It feels great. I mean, I don't think I would have done this things in Mexico. I think it would have been different. I would have been in school right now. I think I would have done just the same just because I wanted to Mexico. When I was talking with my friends in Mexico, what have they done and everything. And theyre still in University, right, they starting and everything I'm like, I would love to actually be in there. You know, I wouldn't love to just feel that. I feel like when I came here in this country, make me to Miss A lot of things like school .. who doesn't want to go to university? Who doesn't want to interact with people your age, to have the same thinking to actually, like express different ideas with each other? Right? So I think I missed that I miss and I would have loved to have that opportunity to actually interact with people who are my around my age. And it's hard You know what I mean? When you see it when you see people that they go to universities, like, when I go to university, I'm gonna be old, people are gonna be younger. \n",

      "Su:\tYeah I definitely was looking out to move out of Pakistan because, where I was staying, in Pakistan what tends to happen is that you have a very limited skillset and people tend to have a very narrow notion about what you can do with your skills and what you can. And I feel I was always looking to move out of that sphere and get into a sphere where I could start over new and my past didn't really matter in terms of career and all that stuff. So I could study or I could go back and say go back to school, I could start working. I could start like becoming an entrepreneur. But my my, like what my motivation always was, was because I was so attached to Pakistan in terms of the not for profit and humanitarian work that I did in Pakistan. I always wanted to, even if I moved anywhere else, I always wanted to carry that goal in my head. So say you know whether I moved to like England or Canada or America I always wanted to sort of ignite this sort of, you know, passion and say maybe overseas Pakistanis or just other people about like arts and crafts in Pakistan and how much potential there is and how much like they're being exploited and how much so my connection was always like, I'll move out Yes, and I'll have like a primary day job or whatever, but I really want to sit down and like sort of promote our arts and like our crafts all over Pakistan… and our music and like everything because it's so rich culture. And in Pakistan, like stuff like Urdu’s wearing out. People don't talk Urdu as much. I and, you know, I mean, that's, that's the language to be proud of. Because honestly, like, I mean, unfortunately, even I can like sort of understand, like, very poetic Urdu because I haven't been brought up there, but I wish I could and I wish I could take pride in it because the kind of like linguistic like it's just everything. I think everything's from like authors like Manto to like poets like Faiz, like, Pakistani art like Sadeqain or so whatever you have, like they have so much more like struggle in their like in their Arts then. Well, it's wrong to make a comparison but I feel like there's so much struggle because it seemed very, very hard lives in that they’ve seen like partition they've seen like, the whole Bangladesh like, you know, \\ they’ve seen just a lot of fractions of life that maybe haven't and then our youth are not sort of. They're not. They're not informed about that as they should be. And I feel like wherever I wanted to go in life, I always wanted to inform people of my culture, whether they were Pakistani or not. So yeah, that's something that I always wanted to bring into. \n",

      "Su:\tSo I was born in Islamabad. So my dad was a diplomat. After every two foreign postings he would have to come back to Islamabad to work at the Foreign Office. I was in Islamabad. When I was 2 I moved to Baghdad for about five years in Iraq and then then I moved to Indonesia for about three years. Then back to Islamabad when I was about seven, eight, and I went to school in Islamabad so this is my first sort of thing with with Pakistan. But Islamabad is very different culturally from Pakistan, from Karachi because there's a lot of foreign population like theres diplomats and stuff. So you don't really feel the typical-ness. You know, it's not claustrophobic, it's, it's a little more broad. And then after Pakistan, we moved to the Netherlands for about six years. I think that was my dad's longest posting and that was kind of like, has in a way become home for all of us in some way or the other and then after the Netherlands, I moved to Russia. So I was living in Moscow for about three years. My dad retired some time in February 2008. I was still in the middle of high school, I was doing my International Baccalaureate, and then so I obviously could not it was like, couple of months ago, my final exams I was seeking move back to Pakistan with them. So I stayed on in Russia all alone. And that was a lot of fun. But apart from that, like I learned about, like, what the Russian culture and about so many things and about just just how like, you know, and I remember ever since I was like, you know, 10- 11 I would just go on and on about Pakistan to my friends and how amazing the culture is I was just one of those like, you know, it's very proud of all of these things and, and people just like my wedding happened in December, and all my friends were like you've been raving about Pakistan for like, as long as we've known you. Like, we're so excited to come. They all, well, some of them came and, like, you know, it was nice. So, then I moved to London to do my law at UCL and then I thought I didn't want to do my bar, whatever I came back to Pakistan. And yeah the story starts from there in terms of work and then finding like, what I'm good at what I what my passions are, like, you know, all that kind of stuff. And it was very difficult sort of moving a step forward, because they're like, but your lawyer, why wouldnt you want to practice law? Why would you want to do this? Why would you want to do that? So So we actually did, like a couple of friends. We actually close… but honestly when I practice law, my my impetus was not to become like a corporate lawyer or like whatever you see in suits or whatever and all of that stuff and makes shit loads of money. It was…it was more like, I wanna work. So criminal law I want to do Human Rights, that's where I was heading towards. And both things in Pakistan are a challenge because a woman being a criminal lawyer, anyone being a criminal lawyer and most of the criminals are very sort of notorious. And you know, I started I remember I started visiting kurachi Central Jail quite a few times to get an idea to get people's stories because I liked writing also, I like writing also, and I remember getting calls and getting tracked and all of that kind of stuff. So that was, you know, just a little uncomfortable. So basically that happened then and then we like couple of our friends were like very passionate and stuff. We, together with the guidance of Asma Jahangir, she's she's a very well known like activist add lawyer in Pakistan. So we started this legal aid clinic, whereby we would work with people who could not afford Legal Assistance which is 70% of the population. So you know if there was like land crimes and you know people taking over their property or people taking the land or people taking over whatever… like whatever is domestic violence or domestic divorce, the husband not giving the divorce, whatever it was, we were kind of solving it and than unfortunately I got a job into another good corporation which was linked law remotely and so I said okay, why not? But I kept in touch with the legal aid clinic and I believe it's doing really well right now. It's it's like when we started we were like, like working from like, what like, basically just like someone was kind enough to give a room from their house, like, somewhere in Lyari, right which is a very…was a criminal infested area. But then, now I believe it has its own office and all of that stuff so it is picking up. I would love to do that kind of thing in Pakistan but unfortunately like, you know, there's implications to that. Yeah as there is anything that's a little out of, you know, boundaries or whatever. And there are a lot of boundaries. \n",

      "Su:\tSo I have met my husband about three years ago at like, so we knew each other through a lot of mutual friends but we never really like met and spoke. But then like a friend of mine, and friend of his suggested that we…like we should probably like, get to know each other and it was a mutual friend of ours whose wedding it was. And so, he introduced us and then you know, one thing led to another we started sort of like, this is December 2015. And he was only there in Pakistan for a holiday and I don't know what happened to me but I just took… I'm very careful about these things but I just took a leap of faith and then we started having a long distance relationship. I told him that like, the only the only way I'm gonna have a long distance relationship with you is if we make an effort to meet after three, four months whether that's, you know, Im not asking you to come all the way to Pakistan or I'm not going to come all the way to Canada but lets meet half way. Otherwise not going to work on the phone and all that stuff. So we try to make an effort to that consistently as possible. Year and a half into it, he wanted me my family. I met his and then from then on. We kind of like, sort of… Oh, we met like in our first holiday was in Lisbon that we went to Miami. We went to Barcelona, so, and he came to … he comes to Karachi every December. So that, and then San Francisco. So like just random places, right? That was one of the things I put in my head was like, Im not gonna go into this blind sighted, you know.  \n",

So he's kind of like an operations as well as, like growing the franchisees business. So he travels. In fact, right now also he’s in Vancouver. So he travels a lot for work.\n",

All right now, I mean, we have actually discussed your professional background as well and in terms of your migration to Canada, did you plan this… So I suppose the right question would be your migration to your move to London. Was that by yourself? Or was that with your family? \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Su:\tTo be honest, I didn't want I don't think Pakistan was even an option because I don't think they sort of sort of did the kind of law that I wanted to do. I think I was just kind of following the footsteps of my brother by going to school in London. But in hindsight, I probably had a better option going North America, or Canada do my law, but I believe it was I just wanted to get it done. I was not a very studious student in any case, so I was sort of like, okay, so we get it done three years done. With America, like or whatever you'd have to do like pre law then. You know, but like being in America would have definitely been a more wholesome experience. Yeah, but but London is fabulous. Great place. You know, at the time, it's funny because right now, couple weeks ago, I read that they changed the law… and the students who graduate from… foreigners who graduate from English universities have a 2 year to find work and whatever. At that time we didn't have that. And with Law, it was a very, like Oxford, Cambridge, very strict, aristocratic, sort of, selection process where the top law firms had people were graduates from there. And obviously people who are not of my racial ethnicity, if you could say that, so that was very competitive. And that's why I came home. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Su:\tI think, I would say say like, anything, really. But I kind of gave that thought up a couple of weeks ago. I don't want to do anything really, because it really does take away from who I am. I'd either go back into the Arts somewhere or the other, do something with writing, if that was… if I were to follow my passion. And if I were to stick to what my expertise are in, it's more like not for profit, fundraising, humanitarian sector, like international NGOs, and, UN, whatever. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Su:\tUmm not too bad, actually. Okay, not too bad, because they, they're very, they're a lot more good with handing out these jobs to people who have like, would have had like a diverse sort of background and cultural, whatever, you know, ethnicity, as opposed to giving them to people who are from here. I don't know why that is but that's probably a good a good thing I guess? I don't know, or maybe people over here just more into like finance and marketing. And that's what I tend to sort of hear every time. So when someone says I have a job, they're like, Oh, well I work for a bank for we work for, you know, whatever a company like Lowe's or you know, retail and that kind of stuff. So maybe that job market isnt built or maybe it'll be funny that way. But it hasn't been like hugely competitive to get a couple of interviews here and there. Like, yes, with the bigger places for sure. But the smaller ones, you get something or the other. \n",

So technically, my status is that I am a non-resident but I am allowed to work in Canada because I have a work permit. But my PR is probably due six, seven months from now.

      "Su:\tLike a year before we got married or maybe at least nine months or 10 months before we got married. Like a lot of research out of like, what lawyers are we gonna get are going to apply ourselves? What are the forms gonna look like? And like I said, like we were always like antsy about the fact that you know, how am I…are we going to be married? How am I going to live like apart from you like 10,000 miles apart? That’s so weird. And then working that around, and talking with people talking to different lawyers, and then coming up and saying, well, no matter what you can be an inbound applicant. So that was a very stressful procedure, especially for my parents as well, because they just didn't think they just couldn't imagine like, and then it was also stressful for me because I was like, So where am I gonna live? Am I gonna live in your house, your parents? Or am I going to live with my own family? Coz it makes no sense to live in your house and blah, blah, blah, like that, obviously, raised a lot of conflict, and because of conflict and pressure was there I think we moved on. I think I really pushed it like…No, we have to find a way to do like the whole inbound or whatever alternative we have. And I'm glad that lawyers are lawyers were not good enough to sort of suggest that to us, because doing on your own is just not as…as efficient like I'd say yeah, yeah. \n",

And but it gets a lot of a lot different couple of months, well people say a couple of years down the line. In our case couple of months down the line. There were a lot of his travels, a lot of like challenges in terms of us getting along as people because we realized we're complete opposite in work like, you know, for fun, but then when it came to practicality, it was like, okay, clash, clash. So obviously one or the other person, or both the take step back in their personalities. But it's been, like it's been challenging.. ill tell you what, its been challenging and we don't share the same interests at all. Obviously, he's been in Canada for what 15 years. For me, I'm new so like every time, you know. So like every time I'm like I get excited about like, you know, going to Kensington Market or sitting on the patios like having lunch, and drinks and whatever during the summer or whatever. He's just like, yeah I've been there done that. And that's sort of like, you know, you’re kind of boring, like, but sometimes he'll he'll understand that like, okay, she just moved. But it really helps the fact that I've got like, some way or the other, a lot of my childhood friends ended up living here. So I do have like, a good like a good number of friends and close ones. I'd be like meeting someone or the other something, you know, you know, I'm not like.. And as far as him moving away, like my mother in law comes and visits in the summer. So she's here these days, and she's like, if you want to come and stay with… She lives with their daughter, her daughter’s not married, so she's like, if you want to come and stay or whatever. I'm like, you know, to be honest, like, I'm okay. Like, on my own. I actually like it, like, you know, and I don't get lonely or whatever, like that kind of thing. I mean, yeah, you know, I'm just I'm one of those like, I just do my own thing. \n",

      "\n",
      "Su:\tI'm actually good. Oh, yeah. So for the visitor visa, the first time I applied for it I got rejected because to be honest, it was a very rushed and most people do apparently from Pakistan. This is the hardest visa, the Canadian visa is the hardest to get. So and to be honest, to be fair, I didn't really put in a lot of documents. I didn't really apply from my heart. So I just sort of gave it in and I got rejected. This time around, like there was a lot of documents and stuff and like a lot of because this meant a lot more or more stakes involved. At that point. I was just going to meet my boyfriend. And then I was this time I was like, you know, I need a visa visa in order for me to get into the country after we get married, right. So the process itself didn't take very long I believed like I got an email maybe like 15 days down the line saying come pick up your passport, but the whole collection of documents and justifying things took a bit longer than that. Yeah, any other visa would say you would see how long isn't like a few months? maybe, you know, I'd say like was, I'd say a month and a half. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, A lot of people like, like my husband's cousin, he applied, he has a Pakistani passport as well. So he applied from Dubai, like within five days he got it. From Pakistan, I don't know why they're just a little more stricter.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Su:\tUm, to be honest, like, well, if I were to go for the typical like words like project management, not for profit management, you know, in terms of marketing, content writing, I’ve done a lot of that, communications, interactions and digital marketing and all of that. But if I were to really look at like, my passions and my skills into my passions, it'd be that you know, I could contribute a lot of cross cultural. Like I said, like I'd love curating like Pakistani exhibition artists exhibitions here. I'd love curating, like pop ups or stuff with like, you know, crafts and things made by underprivileged like woman in Pakistan. So I think the whole cross cultural thing really like link to art and crafts really does help me out. And then, you know, I don't know if that's a skill set, but I think I have a very creative mindset. It's like you give me something as long as you give it to me from the start of it, I will make something of it. And I think that's, that's one of the things that…I don't know if I have that cliche skill set. I've always kind of said, Well, I don't fall into that category anyway. And that's probably why a lot of people are like, Well, what does she bring to the table? Right? But, but there's something I can't explain what I do bring to the table, but it's just.. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tI think you explained it perfectly. Yeah. Yes, you will. Again, it's I don't think that all skill systems are about about actual physical like tangible. Yeah, they're about life skills as well. So I think that that's very important. Did your husband migrate here on the skills visa category? \n",

      "Su:\tOh, he he moved here as a student, he went to UofT. So he moved here as a student..he was. He finished high school in karachi and he moved here when he was done. 2005-2006 – something like that. Like he is his family had also come a couple of years before that to settle in the kids and whatever. And then it was like they had applied as a family and by the end of I think, I think 2011-2012 they all got their passports or whatever. So the parents moved back coz there they have… my my father in law has a business back home and then and then. Well, yeah, yeah, they decided to stay. My husband's younger brother stayed for a bit, didn’t really like itwe, nt back to Karachi to join the family business, and then my sister in law is still here.\n",

My parents don't think that.. theyre like you’re Pakistani at the end of the day, I'm like, well, no Im not, like, yeah, I mean, I am but that not like a… that's not like a that's a nationality. That's not a way of thinking, you know, right. Yeah. That's, that's interesting. \n",

But he's not like every time like say for example if you go out for dinner with a couple of people and they're not they're from Canada or whatever and someone asks how’s Pakistan and I'd be like Pakistan’s great like there's so much…you go up north, there mountains… you go south theres the sea. And he… hes just like Pakistan’s shit, like, wow that's one thing we clash on. Im like Amir, look like we have so many like there's so much culture like you know whether it comes to food or comes to traditions or folklore or whatever. He's not very proud Paksitani.  In the sense of gender roles and stuff, he's very typical but when it comes down to,\n",
      "\n",
      "say like, he's not worried about what I wear, what I do. He's not like in traditional the sense that like, he has set of values and like systems that are… that go beyond superficial things like clothing and all of that it's all about you know, well did you… you know, take care of somebody? Are you hospitable? These are the things that I think comes from our culture because we as people are very hospitable. And we take care of our guests and he's always told me like I'm a hospitable as well, but he's always told me like, you know, guests whoever comes to our house…like that way you can tell the traditionalism coming in but and also the fact that when we started dating, he wasn't like he told me from the first day I'm not fooling around with you like if this works out. I want to get married to you. And I was like, okay, because guys, even in Pakistan dont say that. So that in that sense yes, I'd say he’s well valued but but but not like, you know, very pro Pakistan. Or maybe he just doesn't know it. \n",

      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay, so we'll, we'll get drawing. So, the first question is, tell me about all of the visa categories you went through from the point of your initial arrival to current status. Now, in terms of your journey, I would also be interested in your…Was it a student visa to do the UK? So probably that as well. Went to the UK, you went back to Pakistan. Maybe you want to demonstrate that you were growing up in other parts of the world. It's totally up to you, but like basically all kinds of visa categories that you went through a journey or..journey around the world.\n",

      "Su:\tIm very artsy, so I'm gonna try and do something artsy. I think I'm more in the moment kind of person. So that’s a Pakistani flag. So it says 20th December 1989 the day this is the day I was born. I was born and this is the day that my dad was he was going through a lot of politics in terms of people and his colleagues. So he was fighting for a promotion that he was very much due for. But this day, the day of my birth, I was born as finally when he got that promotion, making him like the ambassador, like in foreign countries. So he always sees my birth as good luck. I've always been like a little spoiled dads child. So moving on from that, like if I were to go on…I wish I knew what the Arab flag looked like. This is Iraq. This is Indonesia. So my first best friend was I met… was in Indonesia. So then, leaving was sad obviously. Then we went to Islamabad which was interesting. So, we stayed like random places. Well, when my dad was doing a course and we stayed in one of those houses too long…Like, our like, container came by a container came from from Jakarta. And then we bought a house and my dad was busy like doing these courses and my mom us were like, just. like first experience in Pakistan like, our maid, like goes missing and my mom was like, but I dropped her home, like last night and she told me this is the house and like the next day the family comes to the house and they're like, like what did you do to like my daughter? She's not back home, whatever and they threatened to put it up in the newspaper or whatever. Turns out the girl herself had ran away with another guy. So that was like, obviously all this visa stuff was supported by my dad. So I don’t really know much about it. So there was this holiday without mom. It was amazing. No with dad was amazing. Yeah, mom was …all these rules back then obviously right. I remember the flag. So That's Holland, that's like legal.. like that’s weed, so Canada. Yeah its way more legal here than in Holland. There you can't smoke on the streets. Over here, like there's no, like you can order it online on the Government of Ontario Canada website…like they even have like CBD oils and stuff like that which you can tell me which which ones are good so. To be honest I'm not like so much as so much a weed person I realized so yeah i think i think i think… or maybe the strains that I've like ordered haven't been like very suitable for me but like in Pakistan whatever I used to get like cuz I love writing so get me very creative. Over here, it just gets me very like paranoid and jittery and I don't like that.  So, well I was a little upset and I think I spoke for all my family when I say this that like this is you know, home. We did there for so many years and moving from Holland to like, say like, you think about like Russia, you're like, what the hell… Where am I going? But then you know, we get there and like, you know, It's amazing. Like it's just the best. I speak Dutch but now that's going down the drain obviously because I have less people to practice with but. Im trying to draw this but its not working…St. Basil's Cathedral basically. Yeah. And the Kremlin, but I'm not I can't draw them. And then funnily enough their flag is the opposite of…So all of this was like diplomatic visa. My father retired in 2008. I'm not gonna go into the English flag cuz, yeah, England..whatever. I was living in London. It was nice. I had a lot of friends at that point who had also moved to London. So it's kind of like interesting because you know, I had a community. Its like those weighs – like justice or whatever. So this is the artist that I work with. Obviously, she doesn't look like that. But just to signify that I was curating in some point in my life. So I got a very serious or, I thought was a serious relationship in my second year like while I was in Pakistan, got my heart broken. I thought it was the end of the world but it clearly wasn't. There are many more heartbreaks after that and many more like fun times. And then we have in the middle, I think, the most important one. Like I know that’s not a maple leaf but like, Ironic, right, because I was born on 28th December. I got married on the 23rd of December. So [moving to Canada], It was a struggle. The weather was a struggle, there was loss of relationship excitement, like I said, husband traveling a lot, not ready to let go of his bachelor lifestyle habits. Now it's gone better because lot of people told him to but initially No. And then I used to be stuck in upset because I but now I found my own thing and I found my way to go through with him and how to deal with him. I know what he's tired when he wants to watch a match, when he does these things I know like the whole rhythm. So I'm not very like pushed about it. But yeah, that's, that's well, that's my very basic map, I guess. \n",

I mean, this is research is also about what people do in turn. of trying to get visas. Yeah, so I suppose the two destinations that I'm interested in knowing about is London is the UK and Canada. And you said that you used a lawyer for Canada. so I mean what I'm wanting to know as any commercial services that you used okay things that you paid for all you guys had to pay for \n",

Had a fee but I didn’t use a lawyer coz obviously university on my behalf had actually, and honestly, the at that point, there was a big clunk of students, in the sense that there was like you know that year… there was a big backlog and whatever people got their UK visas really late so I did miss like freshers week and stuff. \n",

      "Su:\tSo for immigration here I had to do criminal record check. I had to do medical. I think I still have to do a few more things like to prove you know, we're married. The other day, we got a letter from a lawyer from who had gotten a letter from, from the Canadian government saying that we need to prove that we're cohabiting. Im like how do we prove that they're like. Well, basically, you know, joint bank accounts or letters that have come to your house, like addressed to you, but come to his address and that kind of stuff. I was like, Okay, fine. We'll send that over. But like, obviously, I mean, I get it, I get it from their point of view, because there's a lot of people that just get married, like, sort of have an agreement whereby they're just like, okay, I'll get married to but you know, I'm just helping you with your residency or whatever. But yes, but we gave them a lot of proof of the fact that like, I remember my husband writing like four pages of like, how we met, how this happened. Even then they had like questions like, Okay, what was the restaurant where the first date was? What was this? What was that? So they were very thorough and so despite that, like im quite surprised  they still think someone would’ve made that up, but maybe it's maybe it's just protocol? I don't know. \n",

      "M:\tAnd I mean, how do you also look? I mean, I suppose now I'm just gonna ask you a moral sort of an emotional question or Yeah, mental kind of a question where How do you feel about being on this dependent visa? I mean, considering that your visa depends upon your husband and marriage?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Su:\tIt's stressful? Yeah, very stressful. Like, I can't wait to reach to the mark where, like, you know, I'm on my own kind of thing and like, it's not dependent, like, in any way, like, you know, it's a very insecure time, you know, like your dependence is completely on somebody else. Financially also, and as well as, you know, country wise or living wise. That's never ever happened with me. So, I think that that is a that's a tough like. These are tough emotions to juggle sometimes. I've always been this kind of like independent person and then you turn around you suddenly become utterly dependent on someone else. Its like ha ha, joke's on you, kind of thing. Well, I think the first few months like you were kind of like, okay, let's just go with however it is. Yeah, he was a bachelor. So he was like, Okay, we'll buy groceries whenever and neither was really cared. But because I was like, I was so used to a house that was systematic and he was so used to living as a bachelor, that I wanted systems like groceries every two weeks, I wanted to cook coz I like cooking like, I wanna have meals ready, and like stuff like that. So, those are the things I had to like systemize and then obviously, like, anything I needed to get or whatever, like, although, like I try very hard to like pull out my savings or whatever and do part time jobs here and there. Obviously he still supports like, like, anything that I need, right? Like, you know, like give me a certain amount of whatever it is so that I can buy this or that.. So even though like I would not be on this way, I wouldn't be on the street anyway. But like, it's just one of those things where you're like, I'd rather know when this is happening and when it's going to be fine, like, as opposed to be like in the dark because I don't like uncertainty. That’s it. And it's also, I’ll tell you what, I've never lived in a country as an immigrant. I've always lived and my dad used to always say this, and Im like dad “That's such a wrong thing to say”… like don't use the word “immigrant” in the negative connotation, but he's like, I'm right. You realize that when you move there, that in your life you did have like a privileged status, whether you liked it or not, and then in Pakistan you lived at home. Now suddenly, you're basically like, gonna be a barista at Starbucks, you're gonna have problems getting your mind down, right? Rather than thinking I'm still living in that sphere of mind. For me. That's, that was the biggest challenge to overcome. And I think I've overcome that really, but like it's still every day, it's like, okay, you're not starting from if you were at level 10 in Pakistan, you're not starting from level 10, you probably started with level two. Yeah. And that is sort of, it hits your self esteem, it hits your dynamics with your husband or whatever, because, you know, like, it just does, like, even indirectly, its got nothing to do with anyone else. But it's just like that. And I have been financially like, I lived with my parents, whatever. So as far as like bills and stuff goes, I had like no idea… but in terms of like my own financial stuff, like things I wanted to buy or the things I wanted to do, I never asked my parents. So it's it's challenging because I've been like, not that I have to ask my husband for money. He will just like transfer it every month or whatever but, but you know getting there it takes time to get there because it's awkward. You're like, he's my boyfriend you're dating, everything's fun suddenly it comes down to money. And then when I researched it was like, a big like a big issue between couples and I was like, okay, there's the other issue I remember we were joking about this when we were dating was like two two big issues in a marriage. And then one is cleanliness and I remember dating sitting there laughing and saying what do you mean cleanliness? How is that even an issue that leads to divorce or whatever. And and he was like, I don't know, I'm just reading this off a website and the second one is budgeting. And I was like oh Don't worry, we won't have issue with either but like I here now and I have issues with both [laughs]. My husbands not the most cleanest person… he's clean but he's messy. Yeah, he's hygienic. You know, he's he's like, Okay throw the shoes here, the socks here.  And the the thing is it's so funny because I was living at home I didn't really care like I kept my room like clean or whatever but like I wouldn't have cared if someone came to my house and put their boots here or there but now I'm just like “tomorrow I'm gonna wake up I know I have to do it”. So like it just gets me antsy and irritated. And obviously factors like that wouldn't be there if I was like working safe say, if I work from like nine to like six seven, I wouldn’t give a shit about like what's happening like…That's also one of the things I that's why I want to get to work so fast although could take a longer sabbatical, and do part time gigs, but I think one of the reasons for mental stability will also be getting back to work. An idle mind is the devil's workshop this basically it. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Su:\tMostly like brand ambassadors stuff. So right now working for this thing called, there's a magazine called refinery 29. But we know it like they're they're doing these pop ups all over this a fourth year doing these art installations. What it is, is like an experience-based thing. So like they're curating 29 rooms with different experiences for people go there. So, there's like artists, they've been doing this in Florida, Atlanta, and like, a couple of places, and this is the first time they doing in Toronto at the exhibition place. So they’ve picked all Canadian local artists, and they're doing like very like performance art. And it's very interactive. So if you're like a visitor and you bought a ticket, you're not just standing here looking at the museum, but you're interacting with the Art. And so I'm just like, working.. I don't know exactly what my role is till the training is tomorrow, but I'm gonna be like one of their brand ambassadors. Probably make contacts and stuff during that time. But, yeah, it's like 12 hours a day work, but I think I need that. Like, honestly networking, you know, it's like, it's weird because it's not difficult. It's actually one of the easier countries to network. But I just feel like because of the closeted environment that we actually experienced in Paksitan where a girl goes up to a guy like gives out like a visitor cards, like “oh, okay, you know”, so that I think that's kind of been drilled into our like, my system. So like, the whole networking thing is like, like my parents. They’re like “what's networking?...just like send CV’s” Im like dad these guys like networking… it is 80% of the job. The other day I went to this NGOs random like annual general meeting and my husband was like why are you going to the annual general meeting? so random…I was like I'm going to go and try making contacts. After the meeting was done I walked up the CEO and I'm like, Look, I like to introduce myself very briefly coz she obviously didn’t have time. She's like, Look, let me just give you my card and email me and we'll see what positions we have and where we can put you for that was like, you know, like a step to get out. But I think most of the time I'm so stuck in my comfort zone. It's a lot of laziness and like it's, kind of like futility and actions like… Okay, so what if I get this I'm never gonna be as senior as big as I was in Pakistan. So like, I'm gonna have to work what 10 years more to get the level that I was in Pakistan. Its ridiculous. Even though that may not be the truth. But I don't you know, that's what I mean. That self defeating thought kind of puts me back on doing stuff. \n",

      "M:\tAnd in terms of your migration itself was tell me the role of your parents and your social connections. So friends, family community that they played in your migration, or was there? Was there any role in there? \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Su:\tYeah In terms of authenticating that, Oh, yeah. You know, our daughter, was in a relationship with him and they were dating and then she got married and that kind of thing, but otherwise not really. My mom kind of knew, like I told her first because we had… my cousin was getting married in San Francisco, and he was just insisting on meeting my family, and he was my mom's brother's daughters wedding, so my first cousin. And so I said, Okay, fine. You want to move my family from San Francisco and he'd come and then from then on, it was like, no going back kind of thing. But he met my dad like later that year. So Ive never like introduced any guys to my dad, unless the guy has been serious about his intentions and he was very serious about it. So, I guess that was that was that. In terms of dating and stuff, so like my mom would know… But like, I never liked sort of introduced them to my dad, so then he was like okay that's the real deal, you know. \n",

      "Su:\tFor sure. I really want to work with immigrants and refugees. My dream was actually to like move to…. before I met Amir, My dream was to like move to Europe and work with refugees and sort of work in in terms of policy making for assimilation for refugees or refugees or immigrants because I think that is….and honestly in Toronto as well people say oh community centres, YMCA, employment Canada blah, blah, blah. But honestly, that doesn't help very much. It's not about Okay, I want to come and get a job immediately. It's just about like, if, if I've just flown in or whatever, from Tunisia or wherever, I didn't speak a word of English and whatever, like, how can you help me in the immediate level to get me assimilated to my culture, to make sure that I live in a place which has people from my culture, like I've always been interested in, like, migration and like, settlement and, and immigration and just general sort of like, you know, cultural assimilation, and I feel there's a big lacking of that, no matter how many centers they have. \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Su:\tActually no. Like, I as a lot of people for my like, for advice for me, but no, like, I think it's only been nine months. So, I guess nobody has come up to me. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd I suppose what I want to now know is the role of technology and you're in You're such a new sort of moving to Canada and even moving to London, I was I would ask maybe, how did you do conduct online research? Did you look at online resources? And again, broadly, as well, how did you use technology, I suppose even maintaining that long distance relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Su:\tTo be honest, I've been very bad at that. I didn't maintain technology or say, you know, you'd imagine like, you know, somebody who's moving to Canada to be like, okay, let's read up about politics. And let's read up about what's happening day to day and I'd say only the last month I've started getting more involved, the elections coming in and everyone's talking about it. And I'm like, okay I need to know what's going on or like sports for that matter, and that kind of stuff. So I was never very like… London's different because I was more politically aware because it's more globalised.  But in terms of use of technology to help me out Absolutely not. I just didnt. I think every big change in my life has been blindness and aloofness. If I were to put it that way, every single decision that I have made has been just on, you know, just just a leap of faith like really… Ive never really been like, Okay, I'm gonna research this or whatever it's been like someone's given me advice. I like the advice, Ill go for it or whatever. But now like, as I've grown up and realized several mistakes I might have made doing that, I try to remain more informed and I try to research more. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAll right now I think I suppose maybe I want to ask you about your future plans now from here on what's the next step or next steps? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Su:\tWell, well I there's so many steps to be honest… like I want to be. I want to work in the art sphere I also want to work. I also want to like this new thing that I have in mind. I want to become a naturopath… I want to work with organic medicine, with aroma therapy with oils because I that's benefited me so I suffer from anxiety and depression seasonally. So, both of these things have helped me a lot …eating clean, organic and also like a lot of lateral movement therapy essential oils and just tinctures and whatever it is like I've benefited from them a lot. So I really want to do something that would help other people also do that. I want to link that to mental health somehow. So I've been reading up a lot about mental health and about, you know, different therapy procedures and how to do that. I'm not a certified therapist so obviously no one can take me seriously in that way. So basically that’s also something I want to do, but I also like I think my main goal in life in whatever factor would be to help people, whether that's mental health or that's, you know physical disabilities or volunteering at you know, an old people's home because I know I just had this certain like, obviously, I've never been old before and I've never felt the feeling of loneliness of not having my children because I don't have children but there's something that pulls me to connect to people. Whether they're orphans or old people, so there's anything I can do for them in any way id be grateful. But anyway, as it comes to be a very practical stance, I need to have more investment capital to stand and say, this is what I do for a living and maybe one day that’ll translate to something of my own. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd what about like other sort of goals? And I mean, do you want to buy a house? For example? Do you want to have children? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Su:\tWell, to be honest, like, I'm not very profit driven in the sense that I'm not like, I'm a little hippie at heart. So, I would say, my husband the complete opposite He's like, now we've got an apartment. We have a house. Now we have to buy this know we have to buy that, and it's always about that. I'm just like, just relax and enjoy the moment. Like, I'm not I'm not worried if I don't have a house. Kids are not my agenda anytime soon. But I'd like to have then for sure.  Yeah, I think I think right now what I'm working on a lot is personal growth. Yeah, like emotional regulation, and you know, stuff that there's a very interesting therapy procedure called dialectical behavioural therapy. And there's a lot of workbooks available for that. And I think I'm working on that I'm working on just, I am inherently a very sensitive person. So I'm working on just sort of growing a thicker skin and just kind of like accepting situations as they are. And I think the self loathe, unless I know do that, I cant be good enough for anything or anyone. Whether that's a job or relationship or kids or so have you whatever. So the focus I tried, I'm trying to go and it's very difficult because I'm not a every time I tried the focus to go on me, I keep thinking I'm a selfish person. I should be doing stuff for other people because that's how I am. But I've just sort of pushed myself said no, no, unless you cant do stuff for yourself, you can’t pour from an empty kart. \n",

I think I've had like the best of a lot of worlds. And I'm very blessed to have had this opportunity like, you know, success of my own, but like, it's been great, like, you know, like the moving to Pakistan bit was was a little difficult after university, but I think that really, really helped me it's like, move on to this level where I'm at right now. So I would say this present. It's really all of that has helped me to move on to this level. \n",

But I think I struggle with people's mindsets a lot, because I think people are very opinionated over here. But they try not to be.. They try to be very proper. And I think that gets to me, because it's like, if you have an opinion, just put it off. You know, like, instead of, like, sort of, if I, you always feel like… “oh my god, Did I say something wrong?” Did I say something culturally inappropriate or religiously inappropriate, or did I say something about something about someone’s weight or making innuendo? Yeah, and I'm just like, you know, theres too many like self righteous people, at least the people I've come across, in the sense that they're always like, okay, we'll fat shaming and there shouldnt be thin shaming, then there's that then there's that… and you're like, Okay, what do I say? How can I have a conversation with you? Like I just sit there and be like, I am not okay with this, and I'm not okay with that. I have an opinion. But I respect you having your own opinion. And that doesn’t really exist here I think. I don't know, at least amongst the people I know.M:\tAlright, great. So, let's begin with when you first came to Canada, when did you first arrive?\n",

Desi dating – aunty uncle dating. Laughs. So he used to come. A mutual friend introduced, okay. She knew him. And she told me about him. So she was like... she said he lives in Canada, and you know, he has a similar situation as mine again, he was divorced also. Love marriage and then got divorced. He have three older kids again, and then. And I have two older kids and I was divorced also so but I was like, it's not gonna work. You know, he lives in Canada, and it was a love marriage and then divorce and here, so, friends were more like, no, he should talk to him. So I was like Okay. So I talked to him, and we clicked. We clicked on our first conversation, After that I was a mom that never texted. And suddenly I was texting him. I was texting, like 100 messages a day. Yeah, we just clicked. You know, it was the same jokes and we had the same situation with our divorce. He had a hard divorce and I had a very hard divorce. Kids were depending on me, my kids were on me, his kids were on him. So then that, we understand that, we had the similar stories. Yeah. So basically that and then, yeah, with him, I laughed more. I was myself. You know, usually I didn't know if I could talk to anyone. I didn't know what to talk, you know. Because we're so sheltered. with him. I was more of myself. And so we, so he used to come every month. His company in US. He lives in Montreal. So he visits his company in Chicago every month.  And then from there, he would come and see me. Yes, he have stories like, you know, the plane that he travelled and you know, on those small seats and four hour flight and three hour flight, so yeah, he would come every month to see.\n",

So once I got married after a week, I just moved to America - Seattle, Washington. And then from there, we moved to Huston from Chicago, Chicago to Houston and then I lived in Houston for about I would say Jami is 31 now, so probably, yeah, until 2016.\n",

His father just passed away this year. Yeah. He was 86 years old. So and then his mother's at 86 as well. And and she well know his mother's 88 years mother's age. So she's still with us.\n",

      "\n",
      "Me:\tYeah. lives with me. And so for him, it would it was hard for him to move there. Because..because of the healthcare. His sister lives here, but she wouldn't have able to take care of them by herself. So, I moved here left my job. I was working for 22 years. Yeah. And yeah. So that was understood that he wouldn’t move.  And how was that for your family like your children as well or your other family that you were deciding to move? What role did they have to play that this.. Yeah, it was. It was very interesting. My kids, even though they are older, and they were the one who pushed me to get married because they moved out. You know I was living on my own and the cat, and you know us didn't have every time tornado or hurricane come you know they are more worried about me so they were pushing me “No mom you need to get married and it was funny because I would say between all three of us Let's see who will get married first” laughs. It would be like you know somebody would say, you know, you should think about yourself you know your kids will find somebody but you need to think about it then I was thinking okay, you know, I need to find people and you know that butterflies was in my head and then somebody will say “no, no, you don't think about you… think about your daughter. She needs to get married.” So in my head I was like I am an older person I need to think about my daughter. But my kids were very much supportive. They love Ijhtaba. My daughter talks to him about, about any mashwara [advice] and everything, you know, even though they were both were fine, but yeah, it was hard for them. It was hard for them. And I'm finding out now that my daughter when I was married, and I was moving, I was selling my stuff. She just... she was working at the time, but she started acting up. Yeah, she would not let me hug her.  Like she was angry all the time. Because, you know, it was her house and now she doesn't have a house there. Yeah, I'm, I'm the house and I'm not there. So at that point, I was realizing but I was planning to move here. I and I was going through my own emotions. When I was getting married. I didn't think I didn't sleep for like three months. You know because I'm Leaving my job and I'm leaving my house… So she got into that and, and for months, she would not let me hug her. She just closed in. And I didn't know what to do because I was moving and then when I was moving, she left her job and she went to Europe for three months. Backpacking. I was kind of worried but then she is very strong headed and she has a good head on her shoulders. I trust her completely you know. But there was so much going on.. so many pieces were moving that I couldn't even you know, focus on one thing, but she left for three months. She quit her job. And between that time I moved to Montreal. She came back to Montreal to me. And then she was just depressed. She didn't have a job, she spent her savings and it was and this is not her house, and before I was completely hers, but now I have a husband. You know, so he needs as much attention as she does. And so she would not get out of the bed and then after literally yell and say, you know, you need to do something. And I know she wanted to stay here with me, but she couldn't because she couldn’t work. She doesn't have her health care. She was getting depressed and depressed, and depressed. It was very hard. It was very hard. And his kids were, even though they were older, but the other piece was with me that I'm here in their house. Its not my house. So the next morning when I moved here, I was like, I sit on the sofa and I'm like, Okay, now what do I do? I feel like I'm a guest, because this is not my house. But what do I do now? You know, things were not in right places, you know because they were just living. So it's just like, but I couldn't change things like this because I have to still feel that it's their house. I am the one who's coming from outside and then my daughter came and she's depressed. And so, yeah, I mean, it took about a couple of months for her to just move. She went back to Jami in Chicago. They both start fighting because it was just a roommate situation, you know, they she, she was just not…she became a little difficult and as well Jami became difficult and I was in the middle and I got this new house going on…New family, but then she found a job so she was okay. And then I recently found out that Jami was not Okay. He felt like I had abandoned him. So… and I just found out recently…he's seeking therapy. Naz is also seeking therapy and they want me to go for therapy also. Theyre like mom, it's really good because you gotta go you know, get your issues out because when the things happen I was always taking care of them, you know like the divorce. And instead of having time for my depressio. I was taking care of them. So they both are fine now. But in our therapy is they tell them to you have to go and confront people…tell them what's not right with you. So he did, he confronted me. (laughs) and, and I could you know, it was a time when he felt that I was not there, but I was there but he was so depressed that he didn't see me in the house and I was so depressed that I didn’t see him in the house when we were going through the divorce. And he, he told me that, you know, he felt like I abandoned him, but I was like, No I didn't abandon you. We were just too depressed to see each other. He's okay. But we figured out Naz was always the one who would scream. “I want this… why you're not looking at me.” You know?. And Jamal was always quiet. So, he bottled up, and I was thinking he's okay, we have to handle Naz. She's the crazy one. But apparently, she's not the crazy one. We all know we were the crazy ones, we were bottling up everything but anyway. So yeah, it was. It was amazing journey. So he's okay now because he just let it out. And I'm glad that he did that because if he didn't tell me what was bothering you him about me, then I would not know this all my life and I didn't know. I would not know why he's upset. Yeah, at least now he give me a chance to explain myself to say, you know, this is what happened to me, you know? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tNo, no, no, that's all right. That's totally fine and those issues I mean, did they also are they in touch with their dad as well? And\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:\tYeah, they are in touch with their dad but they try not to. So it's, it's hard for them because he he is very difficult person that he doesn't think about other person. He keeps telling Naz that she needs to get married because she's getting old. Shes 28…And nobody will marry her. And, you know, she's losing her. You know, her time to get married. So you will find people, kids, boys, that just want a Green Card and just want to to move here. So he would tell them no see, your time is going you will never get married because you're old, you’re getting too old.  So they don't talk to him. They don't need this.. They still call him to ask him how he's doing. He had two bypasses. He almost was going away and then we came back. He's going very strong now so so yeah. You know, they don't talk to him like Jami had confronted me. He did not confront his dad. you know, and I'm fine. So I think that he took twice on me because he couldn't, you know, yeah, the other part. So, which is okay, you know, but he would get worried about his dad if you hear tornados coming or hurricane came. Yeah. And he would be like, Oh, I have to talk to pap, you know, see how he's doing. So the connection is still there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo dad's also based in Houston?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:\tYeah. He has remarried. And it was funny because I met his wife. And she is very simple, very simple woman, you know, and she told me, she said, you know, kind of like “aap to janti hain na” you know.. yeah. She was, she was trying to tell me that she's in trouble with him, right, like I was. But she's not telling me in complete words. what she's saying that you know how it is, You understand, kind of like, Yeah, I was so sad because I couldn't do anything for her like, yeah, you know, I understand. So, He's married. He's in Houston.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay. And so you the first time you move to the States, it was because of a marriage visa as well. So you kind of got married. Have you moved there?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:\tYes. I had a marriage reason. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it's it's kind of interesting because one husband asked me American nationality, the other one is getting me Canadian nationality. Laughs \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tWell, if that's it, then that's it. Right? Like what are you gonna? Yeah. Okay, so. All right, I suppose. Let's talk about your family back. Do you have mom and dad back in Pakistan? Your own parents?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:\tYeah. Yeah, I have my mom and dad both. My mom is a US citizen. Oh, great. Okay. My dad is not because he has remarried. So he have two wives. We are from the older wife, not older – the first one. So he, my mom is with him now because he had a stroke so he couldn’t move his body right. He can only move his hand and he cant walk. But his second wife with who he was all that time passed away oh so then then you know after he had a stroke my mom kind of went back to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tright okay and when was the last time you visited them in Pakistan?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:\tOh my god long time ago I don't go to Pakistan that often I only been there twice. So the last time I think is was 2000. that's a long time ago a long time. Yeah, my father was, you know, fine that that time and my mom she comes and goes so see her more often. I haven't seen my dad yet and talk to him on the phone here and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAwesome. And let's just talk about your I suppose now your skills that the research is about and so, and I when I asked about skills, what are your skills? I don't just mean professional skills. I also mean life skills, you know, like what, what makes you somebody who's skilled, how can you contribute your skills to this country?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:\tSo in the US, I was working as a, I started my job as a pharmacy technician, I have a Pharmacy technician certificate and I have an associate degree. Just a general one, you know, I took some classes at a community college. So then I started working as a pharmacy technician and that was my first job ever, never worked before ever. And it was Baxter I was a pharmacy technician and then there we had pharmacist and technicians. And manager, and General Manager. And what happened that we had a FDA audit and it didn't go well, because the paperwork was not completed. You know, nobody was doing sign up and nobody was actually checking. They were just doing things. So we had a big fine with FDA and at that time they needed a person to see paperwork from outside eyes - not to be involved in the room or anybody. Before the drug goes to the patient. So I used to when I was a technician, in my break, I used to ask my manager to give me filing, you know, something that I do differently. And, I don't know, it's, it was just me. And then they thought about me, you know, so I interviewed for that position. It was a documentation clerk, and they hired me, and it was very interesting because one day I was with the pharmacist and the technician and I was working under the pharmacist, under their license. So they say yes, and then I start, you know, filling up drugs and this and that. The next day, I was a got this position. So I was sitting outside and checking their batch record, oh, telling them that I'm not producing this batch because you didn't sign for area clearance, or you didn't sign who performed it? And they would be like, no, because, you know, you know, they did it. They just forgot to send I'm like, I'm not signing this paperwork, because if I sign it, then it becomes my responsibility. And then like, No, you don't know and under white guys, you know, big guys, and I'm this Pakistani. Laughs. And I would cry and then the manager would literally yell at my head, you know, they would just go against me, you know, but I'm like, No, I can't you know, because this is my position. I can't release this batch and I would keep batch close to my, my desk and I'm like, No, I'm not. So yeah, I bumped a lot of heads and I we used to cry, because, you know, I wanted to do that, you know, I couldn't release it. And, and later on I mean, they they started and my manager was not actually in Houston, my manager was in Chicago. So it's not like somebody was protecting me. I had to protect myself. I had to be the guy. So then, yeah. Later on, they were all they understood, because when FDA comes in, they are not the one who's explaining. I'm right in front of them. Like I'm sitting with you. And I'm explaining to you why I signed this paperwork and why I think this batch was correct. So at that point, I realize that I can fight you know, I can be you know, I can put my foot down and I never knew I had that part. Anyway, because in Pakistan, my education was not that I did Inter. And since my, there were issues with my mother and father and my father got remarried and all that, and there were seven of us. somewhere we got forgotten, you know. So, you know, at that point, I was an authority, even though I was just pharmacy technician, but I was authority with the pharmacist because I can't rely, you know, it's up to me to release the batch. So I realized that part in me, and then they they got used to me. And then it was funny because I was not a manager, and the manager would come as a quality manager over me, but they would be so scared to get out of their office and knock on the door because they have to, you know, confront people. And I would be still the one who’s on the floor. But I felt that I felt that even though and I worked very hard, I worked two shifts, I worked there 10 hours, I would not get paid for 10 hours. But since I started the quality, it was my baby. So I was kind of like, you know, and the managers, they would just sit in their office and would not come by the manager would just sit and sleep in his chair because the light will go off on its own because this had motion detector on it. And he would be sleeping and I'm the one who's facing the pharmacist and the manager, the audits and everything. So at that point, I was working too many hours and since I was having issues at home with my husband, that was kind of my refuge. And I remember I bought books from library saying how to handle a difficult situation because I was facing that at work. And my husband, my ex would get mad. He thought I was trying to control him. So, you know, so I was dealing with that part, you know, and he got jealous of me because I was not having college degree. I was doing so good. And he was not doing that good. So I was kind of like, you know, in that situation. And then I mean, I did spend a lot of time at work. I did night shifts, I did morning shifts, so I would do two shifts at one time while I was going through my divorce also. And I know I neglected kids but that's the only thing I knew, you know. And I know my company used me a lot because they didn't pay me overtime. They were like go your supervisor you supposed to do that. But then I later much later on I realized that no, the other supervisors were getting overtime. I would spend weekends there. You know, I would just go there at night and make sure everything is okay. Yes, I'm Who's facing FDA and I know they used me and I know I did neglected my kids at that point but that was kind of my refugee, you know, refuge kind of thing that I was somebody there. So then, um, so I always wanted to, to do a business. I would always think okay if I… if I didn't have work, you know I would do a business and with 22 years of service, I had 401k plan I had stock I had a house. Financially, I was okay. My kids went to college… they both finished college because I was like you do whatever you want to do but just finish college because I knew I didn't have college I would work twice as much as the person. So thank God even though our situation was not great. But my both kids Finished college. And I think that was the motivation to get out of the house. So I had, I had management skills even though I didn't have a manager title, but I never had manager, So I was the one who's managing a lot of different personalities, you know, so and then so then when I moved here I was Yeah, I was thinking what am I gonna do? Okay. Part of me wants to just retire. you know, because I work 22 years. 22 years.Yeah, very hard job. Part of me just wanted to relax. You know, because I was always I used to I remember I used to walk. And I would never know how I made it to point a to point b because I used to walk fast. Yes, with the FDA. You know, you have to make copies you have to, you know, you have to be like this. And my mind, start moving very fast. So it took me a long time to calm my mind down because I'm it's always on. So now when I'm here so I do bring a lot of different skills. I never really realized that I have different skills I thought okay I'll get a job as a quality or in pharmacy or something. I came here and I wanted to relax the first year but the language was the main thing here that you have to have a French. I started taking French classes 2016 …completely boggle my mind because it was just like vern, grammar, and going back to the school and you have no idea what is the chair the teachers are talking is in French and I'm like, okay, explain to me this and they're explaining to me in French. I don't understand them. So it took a couple of months and then I took time off from that because I guess I don't need French, you know, because I'm in West Island. And then a friend of mine sent me this job posting at Simwa. Simwa is a government organization and they give French classes and job assessment for the immigrants in West Island. So she sent me this job posting that they are hiring recruiters to recruit students from, from South Asian community for French classes. So now, you know, I got this posting. So then I got into that job mode, you know.. I used to do interviews, I used to take interviews. So I'm like, okay, you know, so I did, went and did the interview. And they were saying that you don't know French. I'm like, well, you don't need French. Because the people who I'm talking to, they don't understand French. You're looking for somebody like me, just recently come and came and don't, you know, need to take French classes and I know why they are not taking French classes. So, you know, that's how I can connect with them. So they hired me, I did really good interview. I convinced them. I was like, okay, you know, I would tell them. If you have kids, and you don't know French, and your kids will know French, they will have secret language. Your daughter will talk on the phone in French and you have no idea where she's going and meeting. They hired me on the spot. So I got this position and others. And I didn't realize I always thought I didn't know how to talk. I mean, I'm talking now. But I didn't know that. I can talk to strange people because now I'm in that mode that this is my job. I have to provide, you know, in 16 weeks, I was supposed to give them 100 students. I give them 100 students in one month because what I realized is, with South Asian community, they're scared. So you go, you tell them they have no idea what's out there. They have no idea it's free. You know? They're like, Oh, it's free. I don't have to pay anything. Yeah. So then I got more. You know, I went to Mandir, I went to Masjid I went to go Gurudwara, went to the Buddhist temple, I went everywhere, you know. And, and this part of me, I'm a more of open minded with religion, I always find very peaceful in all different religions. And there was my plus point, because there was other person with me, and she would hesitate to go to Mandir. But I would be going to church and attending the things and go to, you know, Mandir, and I was handing out flyers and I remember in lunchtime and there was a guy who asked me, he said, Oh, so what part of India you're in I'm like, I'm from Pakistan. And everybody turned around and looked at me. But no, they were very nice. Yeah. So um, so yeah, so I didn't realize that I have that. And since I had a background in quality, I was. I did hundred it's not like Okay, I'm done. You know, in one month you got you, but I did, which they didn't have and now they're realizing that part, and I am very happy about it because they should realize it. But what I did was a student that I brought in for them. I started tracking them, right. Okay. What class they are in, you know, if they left Why did they left? Yeah. So they, they had no idea so I propose to them. I said, You know what, I've got those people here. I need to know where they are because if audit comes in they should know what happened to them. There was a government officer who came in who wanted to see the program. So, he met us and I had no idea about French Okay, I mean, he this guy was there for two hours. My manager was there for supervisor everybody speak in French. Yeah, I have no idea what they said two hours I was sitting. Yeah, after that. And my manager, she would be like, Oh, you know what he said, right. I was like, I don’t know what he said. I was so mad. I was so like, handicapped. You know. Anyway, uh, my contract ended with them. I mean, till the end, I was just giving them you know, that whole sheet that I've made in English and I give them all their registration forms around every couple of them I couldn't find so I emailed to everybody. So, I left. They didn't rehire me because I didn't know French. But now I'm still in touch with them. And now I, I've, they've told me that now the government is asking them to give them all the registration information about the students what I was giving to them, but they have no idea. So, um, so but then so once that happened I was like okay, everything on the side, I have to learn French, so I'm taking full time French classes. So, and then the friend of mine I told her about simwa recruiting so what are my skills in recruiting. So she…she asked me to recruit for her. She works as a director… as a director is for agency called a microcredit Montreal. So what they do is they provide microcredit for new businesses. And they are giving workshops for women to become an entrepreneur. So she said, Could you do that for me, for me and, you know, recruit students so I can come in and give classes here in Montreal. I said, Okay, so she's paying for my time I'm doing part time for her. And this is what I do. I go around and I to church to organizations and I talk about you know, what this is, how important it is for women to be independent even do a part time job or you know, business. And I think it's good for me because I wanted to a business but I don't know how so this workshop will be good. So um, so yeah, that's so my skills would be management skill. I'm very good in managing people. Organizing, making sure procedures are followed. Communication. That's my story strong I can I can, you know, in my French class, I was telling them about the microcredit Montreal program and I got about six people signed up. Six people signed up. So far. I have 10. She told me that she needs six for her to start the class. So, I have done I need to get some more because January's the class time. \n",

So normally, people do it on one sheet of paper, but you can take more paper if you want to know I'm sorry to keepIt's not it's totally fine. I am. This is the recording.

It changed that I got it with my PR quickly. Okay. But we could have done it on our own. It would have been easy process and not that much money but we were kind of scared that might, you know, the way things were going because Trump was coming as a president and we just didn't want to, we want to make sure that things went smooth.

My passport, marriage documents would be one thing that we provide her that and…yes, the full… how, how did we meet? What restaurants we went to, where what was the first time we met? And what did we say to each other gifts, any gifts we have given to each other. So, we are I remember taking pictures of that. How many times he had come and visit me. So, we had to, you know, the itinerary, print out all of those. How many times I went there. Even though when she did her, she documented everything. And then she sent us. She sent us the whole thing to sign and my husband just signed off but then when I got to read do it, there was so many mistakes. So, the dates were not right. And you know, because I have a quality mindset, just like okay, I cant just sign this one. I got to make sure that everything is fine. And it didn't match. I could have written better. Yeah, but yeah, so those dates we have to provide, birth certificate. I had to provide my birth certificate. It was so funny because I couldn't find my birth certificate. So I had to provide birth certificate I remember that. I didn't I didn't know what happened to my birth certificate. So now because now the whole process has changed now there's some some kind of NADRA, some kind of organisation. \n",

      "Me:\tso Yeah, a lot of technology. So we used Viber. Yes, we use fiber because that's the and we were so glad we had Vibber because we would text each other so many times call each other so many times. Emails… we used email also. Email. Yeah. So those were the two things that we used. Texting - viber for texting. And this is to mainly stay in touch with each other. I used Facebook. Yeah, we used Facebook also. Umm, yeah how cold it is. Yeah. Because I had no idea. I've never seen that cold before, and all really doesn't get this cold. Okay, Houston. You know how it is right now? I'm saying that's our cold. This is December, January. Yeah, that's it. So I had no idea and I remember I google Yes, I did Google shoes. Because he told me snow boots. And I was like yes I have my long boots and I'm okay. But he's like, No, that’s not gonna go. You need snow boots. So we Google that. es. So we move on to that goes on the map. And then some snow jacket no and shoes and. It was funny because I could not imagine you know that people wear those shoes I couldn't imagine in cities you know you look at those shoes and you think of okay, like Alaska…that's the thing comes to your mind. Like Igloo. I mean, it looks magical. I love it. It looks magical but my God, you know, you just…like the heavy jacket and then boots snow boots heavy ones, then hat, scarf, like going out you need at least five minutes to get ready you know, I mean thinking making yourself okay I gotta get out you know I have to wear all this.. and then coming back in you just have a lot of things to take out. It was funny because I went to us like I went to his friend's house for in Toronto in April. They did my dawat, you know, so I went to a friend's house and all of a sudden I see these Pakistani ladies, theyre all wearing shalwar kameez and you know, and I'm like, Oh, that's nice with the really pretty shoes, the sandals and everything. So when they were leaving and outside in the Snow. So when they were leaving, they took the shoes out, the sandals out, and they put it in the bag. And then they've got the snow boots and they put those on. They all carry their shoes with them. So that was a new thing. So that was the same month I was going back. So that April here it was snowing. In Huston it's April… there's no snow there's like, summer is coming right. So I was going back to Huston and as like, okay. It's going to be from airport to the plane so I don't even have to go outside. So I go in my chappals/sandals. So then I'm at the airport, Toronto airport. And they say, okay, the plane is ready. But it's 10 o'clock at night, but we have to go walk outside. And I'm looking at my chappals and its snowing outside, and I couldn't believe that in April it snows here. So then I walked into the snow here. So yeah, so then I walked in. I was moving this guy's arm because he was like, I'm gonna slip slip, just hold me and then went outside stairs to the plane and then went it was.. \n",

      "M:\tYeah, I think I'll miss the big snow part. I think I'm gonna go before that. OK, so now on the map. Oh, so let's talk about social connections. So before you moved to Montreal Did you have any friends or family I mean your as your husband was here but friends family greater community that that you had here anybody that you could come in? I mean did you have to make friends did you have to make friends\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Me:\tI had to make friends. In Montreal I didn't know anyone. It was very different because when I moved to America I had kids there so you you kind of connect with the people who have kids right? So you connect with everybody? Yeah you just like you know make 100 friends there because they all have kids and you're just like going you know, doing dawat and all that, picnics because of the kids. Here I don't have kids. So I have to make friends and I got to used to in Huston - having my own group I didn't have a lot of friends then either either later on in life, you pick and choose and you just Just have to small group of people. You know, and that's it, you just meet. So. And here, I didn't know how to make friends. And there in Houston, I had my family, my six siblings, so I didn't really need to. If I want I could just go to their house. Here, I had no idea what to do. I had no idea what to do. And I was…the only people I know is my husband and his sister. And my husband knew someone and we would go you know, but he was, he was divorced. You know, the people don't invite single guy. The families you know, they just like to.. so he was kind of outcasted also. So he knew one or two people so we went to their house. But it's not, you know, people, they they just don't say okay, yeah, you know, well, we'll do davit.. come over, we'll do this, we’ll do that… and everybody in our age is very reserved, you know… we just got used to have our environment and now I had to make friends. So what I did was I posted on social media. There's a there is a Facebook page one Pakistani woman in Montreal, right. So now before that, my sister in law is connected with South Asian woman Community Center in downtown SOC. So she is connected with them. So they had events and she invited me there so we went there. And then my husband would be going with me also, you know, because he didn't have any friends. And now I'm his friend. And then I'm not used to of having my husband because for very long time, I was just going by myself. So poor thing he would just come with me. So, me a couple of people there and I kind of used to go there for to meet people. There I met Maya. And she told me about Pakistani women in Montreal. So then I did that. And there I posted that, you know, I'm new in Montreal. I just came here and…Do we have any meetup groups for Pakistani women or you know… I didn't have any response, but I got one response. Theres a lady, she said, I'm here new also. And, you know, we can meet or you can come to my house and she has a day care in her house. So, I just went there and she lives right close to my house. So, I kind of met her. And then we used to meet for lunch. Yeah, and she's very nice lady. Then she invited me for Eid party with a couple of other people which I'm gonna…. see in this age you don't get friendly friendly with everybody. The kind of you know, you pick and choose. So she invited me two other places, you know, other friends, but I never got that close to any of them. And then I got one person I like…so I kind of talk to her and I invited her, and then my husband knew  a lady, and she told us that she does TCF work (the citizens foundation). So she had event for that. We went to that event. And then still, I didn't know anyone, you know, most of the people. So then, there and then some new little bit here and there. And then my brother came and I like to sing, you know, I always wanted to say my, my brother can sing my father can sing, but I was a closet singer and I am a closet singer, but I have dreamed that I will be a singer one day. But um, so my brother said, Why don't you know, now you have time, why don’t you take classes for that. So then I called someone and she said, well, there is one lady and she sings really good. And she gives, you know, classes also. And apparently she lives close to my house… walking distance. So, I went to her house and start taking lessons from her and then she started inviting me. So now she is from India. So now we have… now I have a good group of people. Mostly, I don't know some for some reason I get along better with the older people. Okay, you know, I don't have young friends that many but older than me just like Auntie's in their 70s or 80s. And I would like to talk to them. So then, yeah, so then I have a very different group. I have Indian, Pakistan, Bangladeshis… everything mixed because my husband is…you know, we just don't go like okay, this is, you know. When I was taking French classes I've made couple of friends there. I made two very young girls 24 years old. I think now there probably are 30 and one is South Indian and the other one is the Punjabi Sikh. And they both are my friends, but they are like my kids age. So, I'm kind of like them, mother. So, both of them got pregnant. Both of them have babies in this month in October. One had a baby boy and the other one had a baby girl. So, I’m knitting, I’m crocheting… I just finished a blanket for the baby girl. So yeah, so that's how, that's how I made my friends.\n",

      "Me:\tI'm still dealing that. Actually, actually, it was very good. It's very good. He is very nice, very open minded, and I can talk to him about anything, you know. I mean, we can be sitting in the car, not saying anything, and we still enjoy each other's company.  Yeah, it's different because I was used to just going by myself. You know, to these parties and then or, you know, anywhere, but now I have to let him know where I am, you know, like, I'm going here and come back here, you know, things like that. Or, you know, if somebody is coming to my house then you know, he has to be okay with that, too. I just have to let him know that You know, these people are coming. Friendship - I mean, I have to think about him also that we both have to get along with people because he, you know, with sometimes people… I did have to face the situation where we go into somebody's house or a gathering and then there would be a conversation about too much religion, religious conversation, and he was just like, look, I don't want to go there. So then I had to think about him. Should I invite these people over, you know, to make my group and so, you know, he's so yeah, so it's it's a different we have to. It's different in a way also because now I have to think about him, you know, making plans with my kids also, you know, going to the US, you know, how many days you're going, when are you going to come back? So, I think we both kind of appreciate each other because I never I never had a husband… you know, my sisters would be like, you know, fighting with their husband and then talking to them the next day, you know, lets go there, we went to shopping together. I never had that. I never had that. He was 18 years older than me. So, and but I didn't mind that as long as as long as there was a respectable relationship but there was no respectable relationship. There was more of I tell you to do this and you do this, So, so I never had that I always used to distant from him, you know. I was very scared of him like he can say anything or do anything. But with him, I can say anything, its more equal, you know, he's very supportive of me and we'll just hold hands in public, you know, and so, it's, it's, yeah, but uh, you know, it's funny because my friends would be telling me Oh, aap ka to honeymoon khatam nahi ho raha [your honeymoon isn’t ending]. And I’m like “haan buhdape ki shadi hai” you know, “ab kya karen” [we got married at an older age, what to do]. It was hard, because you know, divorce is a never thought in my, you know, mind that I will ever get divorced. I thought we will get old, and then kids will grow older and then he will mellow down, you know, but as much as he was getting older, he was getting crazier. The kids were going their ways. You know, and I was like, Okay, my son is not home on weekends, he's going to his friends house and then my daughter get to this age, she'll go out also. I had to take that step. You know, I had to, I had it was not easy. You know, I had to take that step. And, you know, and I never I never thought that I may meet someone because you know, in this age dating is not easy. I have met so many crazy uncles, you know, chichore [sleazy] uncles, you know, it's just like, eww\n",

I'm enjoying things but at that time when I moved, I think the biggest challenge was to make my community you know, to make my friends to have a good circle, which I have right now. I think at that point, that was the biggest challenge because I you know, so…okay, if the spelling is not right…Uh, yeah, yeah, biggest challenge was first one was…making friends. Making like-minded friends. Yeah, not just any friends. like minded friends. And the second one is career, business, Yeah, and the other challenge is… the main challenges to keep….I just realized one thing it's funny how while I'm talking I'm pretty much realizing about myself. Okay, you know, the other challenge is…because before in Houston it was just me and the kids. two people I have to think about. I didn't, you know, don't have to think about me but yeah, to think of kids. Now I got mine two, his three, and then him, and then his, mother.

You know, I'm more living with his kids, then I'm living with mine, but I'm not their mother. And I want to do things this way to make sure everybody is is equally treated. But I think he treats some someone different than the other in his kids and then I think there's issues with that part. But since I'm in the house I have to… at one point I was involved in it… I was like okay do this do this do this. But now I'm like no I can't do this because I get frustrated because I cant you know, I face that I'm an outsider. They're not my kids because I can you know…with my kids I can just tell them whatever I wanna tell them. Like when Naz and Jami were having issues I'm like no, Naz is like, Mom Jami is doing this to me. I'm like, Okay, tell me what Jami has done. You know when you move there, he has done this. No, I'm not taking sides… If Jami isn’t doing this, he has done many other things that are right, you have to see that also, you know. So I think that's my biggest challenge now. I'm there, but at the same time I have to put that glass wall that, you know, I shouldn't be involved in it. So it's keeping up with two families… Family family crisis, two family crises. \n",

I mean there's nothing going on as such that that I will go back or something like that. But that's something that I think you know my kids are there. I'm here and I stay here because of the…because of the healthcare. If I go back there without a job, I don't have a healthcare and…So still it doesn't seem home. Yeah, it doesn't seem home. it doesn't feel home you know, even though I'm trying to make it as my home and I really like it and I'm thinking this is better because at least there is a healthcare, you can go into your doctor anytime. But at the same time, I'm thinking, you know, my kids are there you know. So that's, that's my fear and yeah, I think that's that's it. Okay. [Ageing in-laws] Its challenging because they both, my father-in-law and my mother-in-law, they were 86 and 87 at that point and they were living on their own because they had been here a very long time and they had a very active life but now when I moved here, it was hard for them. Very quickly, it was very hard for them because my mother-in-law, she cant see. She has a eyesight problem and my FIL couldn’t hear So they had to move with us. I think within a year, they moved with us. So that was a big challenge because I used to be living on my own. The whole house – it was just my house. Now I have to like, they cant, I have to give them food in a plate, they cant see, you know, or they would be, or my MIL would want me to sit down with her, or watch dramas with her. And I think at one point I did that because I was excited also that I have someone at home. I never had MIL or FIL living at home. Then it gets too much, you know. And then, that part, I still would be very respectful but at the same time I would just close the room, you know and I think that was the challenging part, and then my FIL passed away and now my MIL is by herself and shes more needy because she cant see so she gets frustrated and she… yeah that’s a responsibility.  My husband is close. Since he works from home, he would take care of them, he would give them food. He is close to his parents but at the same time he gives me room also. You don’t have to do it, I’ll do it. So, Im glad he is like that. He’s not like, well you have to take care of everything. He’ll take more… but I’ll do it because you know, what goes around, comes around. I don’t want things like that. But it was challenging because we both cant fight because if we fight then they get upset. They think that there’s something they did that we are fighting about. If im not in a good mood today then my MIL start crying and she thinks that she did something and I’m not in a good mood… maybe we are fighting because of her. \n",

I have to find out what it is because I know if I do not have the Canadian citizenship, I will not have the, I will not get assistance from government once you get old – old age assistance. Hopefully I’ll keep both but my husband was telling me that somebody had both and the border inspector took the American passport. So that’s gonna be my challenge.

And I was like, I cant write an exam in German. learning basic German is different and doing a course In German is a lot difficult. Then something happened in Australia which made me change my mind.

And Im like No. I just need experience for now. I was even willing to work for free. So I was competing with the graduates from the local cities.  And then there are the IIT’s that are a completely different level. My parents wanted me to go for that but for me, but I told them in the beginning, that’s not happening.

Canada, yeah, IELTS – since it has a validity of like two years, I give on a 2012, 2014, 2016 so its times 3, which is kind of good, like I improved over the years. I did one in 2012 and that expired in 2014. Then again, I didn't go anywhere. I was still there so like had to do it again. IELTS and medical. I heard stories of the agents, they misuse, or are ignorant you can say, and I didn’t want a rejection because of someone else. If it’s because of me, that’s okay. Got my education assessment from WES. We had had a family auditor… he takes care of my mom, dad so was using them for few years that as well as -  Health insurance was for 3 months here.

Everywhere I asked, they needed a licence, a mechanical engineering license and that again takes time. I have to do something till then. So I ended up working some odd jobs. I worked at the vegan cafe, a grocery store, an Indian restaurant. It was a good experience. I learned a lot. And that was, like, somehow, I came across a person when I was working at the Indian restaurant, to who led me my full-time job. He recommended me. Ottawa was easier compared to Toronto. Like here, I don't know why, but I've only been able to meet people through the Meetup app other than my colleagues. So meeting people is hard, or making friends is hard, at least in my opinion in Toronto. It’s a busy city. Yeah. There was Indian food festival. I think I went to that and met some people in Toronto. Meetup has been more helpful so yesterday I went for a hike through the app. Like that was my first time and they have hikes every alternate week so that was quite nice. I drive so that makes things convenient. I haven’t used public transit at all since I arrived in Toronto. Not at all. And I like, work on a project that involves the transit system [laughs]. \n",

Quit everything and settle here in Canada? And then does the other guy, hes like “if you have a good life? What do you want to move?” And this went on and on and on for a while. Its like really, a lot of negative aspects that he said. You should listen to other people's advice, but its totally upto you. As far as I can think maybe he wanted that kind of life and he didn't have it and [laughs]. I can say, Im lucky. I’ll add that. Me and my one of my close friends applied for the US visa together. Same time, same embassy. All I got asked in the visa interview was which university? And What's your major? That’s it Two questions? You didn't ask me for any paperwork?, nothing. I don't know like, what happened with my friend, but he got  rejected twice… as a potential immigrant for US. And even Canada Day. I got done in a month or max two months.

The economic situation…first of all, the way you apply for jobs, and the way you are screened, the way in my country – it was bit hard to get jobs. At the same time for a woman in my country… My country is democratic but at the same time the women in same positions get much less than men…that’s disgusting… I really didn’t like that we worked two times more than men and you get to two times less money. That's because there is a huge gap. Its not the the topic of the main… usually it's not discussed sometimes know some, some companies they are good, but in my case that they were not.

So, when I arrived here, so I didn't want to go to other fields because that’s the only thing that I can do. Not that that’s the only thing but that’s the thing I would like to do. Ideally it would be urban planning but that’s a bit hard to get. You need extra licences and certifications for planners. there’s like a never-ending circle of requirements. Firstly, you need education. For education you need ... like you need to start from scratch for urban planning. For architecture it’s a bit easier. I need a confirmation of my diploma but still that takes time. So I inquire with the public support companies, support for new comers who specialise in architecture so I did some coirses for architects – certain bridging programs and then I was enrolled in a 2 month placement – unpaid unfortunately but still I got a clue about how it works because its quite different from my country and from Europe. The structure is just absolutely different. When you never did this before. Here you come and everything is wood wood wood. In Europe there is good construction but not so much as here. Like here everything is much more costly, and the materials are all wood, and they measure in inches and im used to measure in meters. Its onlt now I get used to that. After the bridging program I was directed to the co-op. That was voluntary. Not like you have to go there but instead of just sitting there wasting your time, I took that opportunity. So that was in Feb to Apr. So since April I sometimes do different projects for this guy. Not regularly but the first project I did was 3.5 weeks and now its much more faster. I enjoy when projects changes regularly. He was connected to the… He had his own company about the co-op students and not only you come to work, but he teaches and supports the students from the co-op with short term projects. \n",

So, its 40% or 50% something like that. Its covered for the first time employer. So he didn't have any appointments before. So the government - they support the hiring of newcomers. So he was trying to hire me but the thing was the the employer needs to have his company for a year and at that time his company was 8 months. So the reason I was told is that they didn't want to emerging businesses to use this opportunity just to run their business, from scratch, they want the company that can survive so that this could be beneficial for both. So now I was waiting for this year so I am still waiting until Christmas because you never know what will happen until I have the job offer or confirmation. Because that happened to me before, when we were waiting for the response for one and a half month. I agree with the person that I will start and I did not say sorry can I go to another interview.

So before that I was applying for the Green card but that was like a, I was just trying for it.. like not expecting that something would happen. That was just for fun. So, and when I was applying for the Green card I thought I would also just apply for Canada. Why not also do this application. I was considering US more than Europe – like American countries or north America more than Europe. So mu country is in the middle of Europe and Asia. Australia is a bit, maybe geographically, it’s the same difference but its so far. It feels far away. When I was in my country, I was talking to some Australians and they were spending like 2 days to get to Paris or somewhere around, like 5 changes. And Canada was like 1 day in transit. Canada is more like, I understand Canada better. Australia seems very different, like a different region, also the weather is upside down. Canada is more to what I am used to. Political situation in Europe was not very nice. I don’t think its sustainable if I can say so, stable? For immigration, like where I would go would be France – where I was studying or maybe UK. For me in France the problem was language because I didn’t have enough time to study it. French people, they’re really closed. To get in that community, you need to work really hard. For UK it was hardly possible to find any immigration options and the same like, story with Brexit and all this. Its so nervous around Europe and Canada is far away from all this. Its mostly calm. Yeah, US you have some craziness on the side. Its not like in Europe you have 10 neighbouring countries and theres a lot of political pressure. At least here you feel like, its more stable. I mean there is some political issues around through US but you don’t feel the pressure. \n",

      "D:\tHonestly, I wanted to immigrate when I was a child, 12 or 13. At that age, my mother was trying to apply to Canada. You know about the soviet countries in the 90’s? It was hard times and many people were trying to immigrate at that time, but it was very hard to get the money to hire the lawyer. It was not the internet time as it is now. So, problem was the lawyer – he was certified lawyer and so actually…so, he helped around 10 families let’s say…. He sent them and then people spread the word and then second time other people came… and he just collected the money, grab the money and left and my mom was in the second part [laughs]. I was considering going to Germany before for my second year but then my university didn’t provide me some documents. So, there was some problems. I didn’t have much option. So didn’t apply to any other places and I decided to study Masters. That’s it and I moved to France and at that time, like 2007-8 there was an economic crisis which affected the construction industry a couple of years later. So, it was impossible to find a job. It was very hard. Some people were staying for PhD but, at that moment I was just tired. I thought maybe in few years. At that time I was like, no not now [laughs]. After that I came back and it was fine. I was working on a large-scale project, Asian games. So, I went to Indonesia. The environment was so nice. I wanted to stay longer. Everything was so rapid around, it was interesting. It was a great experience. It was a multicultural environment which was new to me. But, that’s about the country, the mentality – how it works [in Azerbaijan]. That was why I left – not the crucial reason but one of the reasons. It’s a little like Turkey, maybe?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "D:\tTourism is now big in the country. It doesn’t really help the locals. Its less affordable than to go to other countries. For majority of people that live, I think that’s not good. It’s just not affordable. You get paid for example $700 a month and you spend, just to go somewhere for 2 days, like $400 or $300 and for 2 days! Its sometimes that bad. It was not like this before. Before the tourism was not so developed. So what worked for tourists is that the visas got cancelled [visa on arrival]. So they want tourists to come and spend their money in dollars, and they adjust it so it puts prices up for local people. So, for international tourists it’s still fine but for locals its more than the previous prices. \n",

      "\t\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo, um, so let's also talk about the mean, family, the role of your family in your migration. So you're, you're married, you're with your husband. So, what was the sort of decision like what was his position? Things like that. How did the decision come together?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "D:\tI think that…he’s like, I prefer not to speak about it. I got a huge stress at work and at that point he said that hes done. So the only chance to immigrate legally and affordably, because I had some savings and both of us had some savings so we could spend that to move further. At the time we didn’t spend it all yet and I was lucky to get, like contact some lawyers that some people from my country recommended. It was still a risk but it’s always a risk. But there was no possibility of doing this without a lawyer. And then I just started collecting documents. They requested like, this paper, medicals, diploma, something something. I was just sending that and then after we applied, in August – we applied in March. In 6 months we got the response that we need to pay the arrival fee – the last step. I was collecting documents for 7 months – 7 months from when I contacted the lawyer and started. So, still we didn’t believe that something has happened but then we received the confirmation so, it was actually done.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "D:\tNo. Im not a community person. I was a community person before but with my bad experience in having good friends, I decided to stick to myself [laughs]. Also as I grow older, I become more introverted and I really enjoy being alone. I find peace of mind, I enjoy it. I still won’t say I hate people, no. But I enjoy my time alone. But with community, they have, in Pakistan also maybe you also have it, like mental things, you know what I mean? I don’t like that. I think that should be in your mind, not on the rules. Like family traditions, why? In fact in most of the families, the women are the leaders, like earn the money, and all the family survives because of them but still the man has to say his word. Its ridiculous. You know, Im here to change my society. I think im here to stay away from it. There are sometimes good people, but I want to explore people fro other places, I want to develop my community. If you want to stay within the same community, why do you move? Just stay there. That’s why I don’t understand people who become patriotical when they move here. There is not a big community here but there is. I am on a WhatsApp group and theres like 250 people on it. It was a group without a possibility to speak… I was just on there to go through the messages for immigration. I was scrolling through the names and like 200 people – too much.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "D:\tIm a workaholic. I love doing my job. I can do different jobs – planning, architecture, I sketch and draw. I really have fun with that. I have skills in like actual sketching and drafting – it was only in the 4th year of university that we started doing it digitally. But even when I apply for jobs here, people get quite impressed that I have the old school, not old school, but skills in actual sketching and drafting. It’s not very common nowadays. I do some graphic design as well. \n",

      "\n",

      "M:\tGreat. Awesome. All right, now we will move to the drawing. So because you're such an awesome drawing person already,I'm really excited to see I'm just kidding. You don't have to be you don't have to be fancy or anything. You can be as simple or you can be whatever you like. Okay, so like I said, there is possibilities to do it on type of visa. But I suppose what I want to maybe hear from you what I want to know is your migration history. So, tell me about the process of going to France. So the reasons that you went on France and the reasons and then also the then migration to Canada, in a drawing. So, a lot of people do it like a timeline, but you can do it however you love.\n",

      "D:\tSo lets start from, so from my city. That’s the city where I studied. That was an academic visa. Still Schengen visa but study visa. I don't know if I remember correctly. Then actually I had a 3 months’ work permit visa afterwards in 2011. Should I continue with my work visas? Are you sad because my map will look small? So then 2018 – Permanent residence visa. So Toronto. I was applying to Ontario program so that was express entry and the thing is I don’t know French so it cancles Quebec, Alberta and Calgary. So I didn’t consider that part. I like big cities. I stklll don’t like to live in the center but I think there are more possibilities and opoortunities for work here, and for professional development and so that was the major thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\t And so those are the visas. Now let's talk about commercial services that you use during your migration journey. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "D:\tSo for this one, so this one will be – commercial right? So here, I had university fees. At that time it was round 2000 euros a year. After that they moved up to like 7000. When I considering applying…that was 2010. Initially I was thinking about Sweden. They had at that time the architecture university – it was free for international students you just had to pay, like student and teaching fee which was like 150 euros. But on the year I was applying, it was shifted up to 25000 euros. From zero to 25000. So I was looking for others and France was fine. After I left, they moved it up but not like 25000. It was still reasonable. You can afford to study there. And 25000 was just one year so you can imagine studying the whole masters. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tand while you were studying in France were you working?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "D:\tI did not work but I received governmental subsidiary, like that was student support. So that was selective. If you are a good student you will receive that in 4 months. I also did IELTS [to study in France] – academic exam. Some of my friends they were using companies connected to universities but that was for UK. But the education in UK is huge money. We did both – IELTS academic and general fro both of this [France and Canada], lawyers – like lawyer company. They have so offices in Ukraine, in Toronto and some other places. I think HO is in Toronto and then there is branches. Its Canadian licensed lawyer. Most of the dealing was done online and then after the big chat that I want to apply, there was conference or seminar in my city so they said that if you want to meet her and see her, you can. So we just went and met and I would say that it wasn’t that personal meeting. You can ask questions in 5 minutes and understand how they work, and also trust. So went to the seminar before using. Other things were medical, transcripts, WES, translation. So my husband took English courses because, I was main applicant but he still had to do the test for some points. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tYou were the primary applicants of what you went through the points test, right? Like the points. So what was the points threshold? You? You?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "D:\tI don’t remember. I just got the answer yes! So I didn’t care much about the points. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo how did you for example choose this lawyer? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "D:\tOf course, okay you can figure out of lawyers but my mom had the bad experience so I was careful. Honestly I found this lawyer through my mail specialist. The person who brought my mail. You know they have a huge network; they know so many people. She said that couple of her clients, they left with the help of a lawyer. But she was still afraid to recommend me. Until the last day she was worried that if something goes wrong she will be responsible. So, she had a bit of stress too. But it was fine. It was more, I suppose safe, that she was a part of my network, like you know the people, at least through someone. That was pretty fine. That story – like it happened to my mom in late 90s. Now I heard some cases but I don’t know if they are certified people because I know now they should be certified. At that time, the whole immigration process was complicated. To get through that you need time, you need hours of research. But still you get what I mean. That’s why I prefer to use a lawyer. Even the date, the date you apply plays a role. The same application a couple of weeks later could be different. So now, I know they should be certified and you can check them online. At that time, I don’t know, maybe I was lazy.. It was comparing to the salaries I get in my country, it was expensive. Considering I managed to save money working on the international project, I was fine. If I didn’t do the Asian games project, I wouldn’t be able to do this. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAll right. So now in terms of other other things that you spent money for, was it an expensive process overall? Sure. Was this an expensive process overall because you spent money with you have two aisles, right? And three for your husband. So\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "D:\tHonestly, I did IELTS three times. It was so ridiculous because once I had a mark of 8, at least 7.5 or 8. So average was 7.5 but the minimum mark for each section should be 7 and I don’t know why, couple of times….once I had 7 and overall was 7.5, once I had 6.5 and 9…so still in average it was fine but not 7 in each. So I had to go 3 times.  Also, I did translation services of Diploma, and the Minister of Foreign affairs confirmation for Diploma, like conformation by local authority. Also, here, that was for my husband mostly. \n",

      "M:\tAlright, let's move on. So now let's talk about the role of technology in your migration. And I'm talking about overall technology. So how did you use let's say online research, social media, communicating with lawyer, anything, anything that you needed technology for?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "D:\tI needed the technology for everything because I was sending for here except for WES and some transcripts because that was by mail. So here it was email – all coordination and registration and results [IELTS] – all communication was like skype, emails. Also, I will not mark the rest because that was in person, translation was in person, WES was by mail. The transcripts I had requested by main from my French university, so they had to send to it WES directly. I cant say I studied a lot but what I studied was enough for me to understand that I need to hire a lawyer. I'm really lazy person. I'm not so stupid but I'm too lazy [laughs]. I used the internet mostly to get general information on immigration. I don’t know exactly but the governmental immigration website, CIC… and upon arrival same website for finding my realtor… that was the first website, I have it in my email [checks email]. And I was using WhatsApp mostly before arrival. That was only discussions. Now I join FB groups but then it was mainly that. I still use Whatsapp mostly for family and friends lets say. Here I used more skyping, and emailing still was common practice. I used FB but just scrolling – not much. Maybe just social groups. You start talking to people and then you get busy and don’t reply and then it comes up that you didn’t respond for a week and im that person, I feel ashamed to write afterwards again so sometimes it just goes vanished. I hate the discussion forums. Im not in that. \n",

Both emotional and financial, I would say, until…lets start from here [France0 Financial support for sponsorship, I’m the only child and…. here and here [Toronto] mostly emotional, sometimes financial by mom, Toronto is an expensive city. So that was the JVS company that directed me to the bridging program. So that was the JVS employment services for placement and support with application to governmental program, support for employment for future employment and still they have covered some expenses like free books for the course, business cards. So here the student support was financial. That’s it for now. \n",

      "\n",
      "D:\tShes alone at the moment. That's the thing she needs to not accept, to over come at some point because after sometime when I get an opportunity to work and become more stable, I will bring her here because otherwise we both would stay there and having no big perspectives so its better to hope for that now. I don’t know if I could explain that. In the future, but not like in a year or 2. Shes working now. Shes fine now. Shes not an old lady with a cat or somethings – its not a depressing situation [laughs]. I lived with my grandma and mther before marriage. When I got married 5 years ago, we lived separately.

I don’t know maybe some major  changes would interest me but small stuyff, not. Im interested to watch it atm [elections].

      "M:\t Tell me about the biggest challenges of migration…challenges or obstacles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "D:\tAll these challenges or obstacles you face, once you arrive, sooner or later you will solve them. So this one, not big one, missing.. like my husband he has a diploma that he didn’t actually receive because people in the university, they were lazy and they didn’t do it – So diploma is like a book so they just sent it without transcripts and all. Missing pages in the diploma. We knew the people who were working in the university so they solved our problem fast. If we wouldn’t know that, because that was the time of summer, if we wouldn’t know these people, it would extend it for 3 or 4 months and still we need to go and ask them. You know sometimes they send it somewhere else. We managed to solve this in 2 or 3 weeks. Its not so much considering that they had to dig, take it out of the archives and do the job, and to stamp it, and to sign it. I was surprised it was solved that fast. The challenge – the biggest challenge and still for now is like, employment and in my case, first thing that is challenging is that there is no Canadian experience which they stick to no matter where you work. It can be McDonalds, or any other place, cleaner, doesn’t matter. If you don’t have Canadian work experience, it reduces your chances of employment. So, lack of Canadian experience and they want it usually longer than a year. I have here like 5-6 months. They usually write like 3 years on Canadian experience, 5 years of Canadian experience in the job ads. I find it a challenge because that’s n ot fair. The thing is that if I was told that they don’t care the skills in Canada you have so even the cleaner, or some service jobs – they still would consider it a Canadian experience. Even if you apply for design but you haven’t worked in design, they still would consider you. But I think that’s the perception coz I was working in an international environment and I know the system – how it works. So maybe for some people its important. You also have interviews for that to understand that people can work or not. But on the point of applications, you should not just throw the paper without looking at it. Certifications, licensing, there is also another local expect for WES, another diploma confirmation. So, WES works only for arrival. Here, you need to go to another, in my case. WES only works for immigration purposes. Generally, its good. I had it added in my resume but actually, the diploma is confirmed by WES. This certification, this should be a CACB authority – that’s architecture board. Im not sure if planning has it as all. But they are some courses that are not approved at all. But I hope to do that in some time because it is still costly. The challenge I would say, is finding an apartment because you don’t have a credit history and that reduces your chances. We behaved well and very nice, really because I have education and I can say that im not going to not pay you money. I don’t want that problems. I think that’s – maybe that’s a perception but that still works in some cases. I found the driving licence a major obstacle for me. Yeah, coz I didn’t have a car before. I had a license back in my country before. Here the system is.. first of all you get the G1 which is training. Then after a year you still can drive only with a person who has the G4. I can only drive on my license only for 30 days or 60 days. And I failed it too. And the thing is I need a confirmation from my country to get the licence directly but that’s an issue now that I am here. And still this is an obstacle for jobs as well because even if I have a good commute to the location of the interview, most of the cases they ask about the driving license. That’s an issue because in most of the job descriptions, it is written that they require a G4 driving license. So for me, its like a huge… its not a challenge, its an annoying. I decided to wait for the confirmation from my country because I don’t want to go through the test again, because what if I don’t pass it again. When I have this letter, they allow me to get the license directly. I just applied it today. That was local fee plus payment to home country embassy for driving experience confirmation. [husband] did that already. So he did that I didn’t and we decided to do that because at least one of us would have it. \n",

So I just try to avoid this people. That was on the forums maybe just maybe once or twice on YouTube, by community. They complain in some cases. Like what happened was my husband was addicted to youtube before arrival to Canada. Like last two weeks. He was just sitting so stressed. I just asked…What are you? Why are you so stressed? It looks like so bad he told me. I said Why? And he said I watched it on YouTube. I was like can you imagine any normal person was satisfied with his life, coming to YouTube and saying how good it is? No. Usually people come to complain. You only hear mostly the negative. Especially for post-soviet people..the mentality of our people. It's not only them…. I am like this too, but not so much. I hope so. Always complain to find the bad things, to discuss it…this could be better or I had it better before. Usually you watch it in your own language and this people, when you Google it, it comes out as research. You see the negative just stop watching that please please…And he said like yeah, maybe you're right. And really the fact that maybe we didn't meet the circumstances this people met when they came. Its like I've got a I had a little allergy, and its cancer. Yeah youre gonna die according to Google. \n",

We would like to have kids, I don’t know where it comes. In between somewhere [laughs]. I would be happy if I have 2 kids. Probably get the mortgage before they come so they have a house. In the more future. I don't know how is it possible, Maybe a design company? That one is very far but I would like to invest in green technology, not developed but, there are many young researchers to do their job very well and they just need to push to get into the market. You know that franchise thing? You get their idea and stuff and they still get to participate… something like that…maybe in, how can I say it? green technologies – but that’s way too far.

At the time I had to come back because I didn’t plan much. But afterwards, when I came back, I got married. I had the job I had the job very interesting job I wouldn’t get in France at that level. Oh, so that’s something here - for Junior position they consider me as overqualified. In intermediate positions, I don't get to that stage. So, in many cases, they…when I applied for the project technician lets say, they say you need to go more to design. When I go to design, they say I don’t pass the search engines. So, I become may be overqualified or under qualified. Overqualified for junior and under qualified for senior. \n",

      "world will have the sea. The beaches, and you get a lot of fresh air. So one of the other reasons I choose Toronto is because it has a huge lake. I don’t live by the lake but I do have the opportunity to go and see when I want. Its pretty costly to do things at the moment because of the financial situation. But we are in the process of getting a car. Its still the cost of insurance, its like crazy. The average is around 200 a month which is a lot. For me at the moment, I don’t need a car. Its also crazy parking prices. I would rather drop it at a subway that has a parking and take the train. But for my husband, hes commuting to the north part and there are only buses and the distance is not that much but he wastes like one hour for only 5 kms. So he definitely needs a car.M:\tLet's begin with when you first arrived to Canada\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tI think if I had to pick one, I would say the political climate in Mexico. It was the party that used to govern Mexico, and basically turn Mexico into pieces, was going back into power. And everything was getting really dangerous, crime was spiking again. And I was just tired. And also those lack of opportunities, so what happens in Mexico is because of the economy model that is used… the gap between middle class and high class is getting really really big right to the point that right now there's not really a middle class in Mexico. It's either you have a shit ton of money or you're working class and if you lose your job, you're basically homeless. So I was approaching the bottom and and that was just tired. I was just tired of being working 10 to 12 hours a day plus something extra to come later just to make extra money. And then I think the cherry cherry on the cake was the this the Peña Nieto who was a president, he won. It was a fraud but he won and he was going to be the party is going to come back and steal everything… just destroy the country again, which it happens. But I wasn't there anymore. But that was the main reason why we decided to move. Me and my wife. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tThat was the main one. I would say there are other factors that, that I know when I think back at the time, I know like one was, I think I wanted to reinvent myself. That's one thing that I couldn't be. I couldn't do it in Mexico. Another thing I would say I wanted to experience a different culture. I worked for a few months in Spain. Yeah. And I really liked it. But I also wanted to go to North America, and I don't like United States or Canada was my first option.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay, and why Canada? I mean, we I've you just said that Canada was your first option, like had you done a lot of prior research into Canada? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tI did research Bunch of countries based mostly Europe, Canada, US… even and I consider the US. So it's a North America, Europe and Australia at some point, Australia too. Yeah, I checked that. And after so I'm so just to give you something Yeah, I'm a project manager. I'm an engineer, I have a software engineering degree. So, I'm very methodical person. So basically, created a huge spreadsheet with pros and cons for every country.. So, it was kinda interesting that I mean, the first thing that we consider was we need speak the language. That's one of the things that we wanted…that narrows or I mean, not a lot, but now is basically to the US, Canada, in America, the UK, I mean, Scotland and Ireland and Spain as well and Australia. was basically that in the end that those ended up being a..lets say second choice. And then after that I did all this analysis and all the immigration processes of the openness of the culture regarding immigration. And after reading all that, I realized that Okay, so it's Australia or Canada. Those are the more open cultures loving immigration. So either or so, and the main decision was well Australia’s kinda far. And so if, and it had happened, so if one of our family members of friends die, we want to be there. If we took a flight from Australia to Mexico City..it's like 27 hours. If you took a flight from Toronto to Mexico it is four hours. So that was the deal breaker. \n",

So, my great grandfather came in then my grandfather was born in Mexico, my mom and me. So, and on my dad's side, they're from Spain, but they came two centuries ago. So that's kind of lost and my wife, so one side of her family's from Spain, and the other one is from Lebanon. But she's third, second generation in Mexico from Lebanon. So, her grandfather migrated from Lebanon to Mexico. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tSo, we decided to move after we got married. We got married in 2008. I think it was like end of 2009 when we decided to move here in 2013, so I’d say like, around three, four years. Doing research planning and applying learning French, all those kinds of things. So very basic mine, my wife is better, but we did learn some things. We hired a teacher for French in Mexico.\n",

      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd did you like did you think about particular sites of where you wanted to move? Like, were you sure that you wanted to come to Toronto for example? Okay, yeah, so not other parts of Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tWe consider Montreal and Vancouver at some point, but our main choice was always Toronto mostly because this at the time, where we knew it was like the financial centre of Canada first. So, All the money's here. So, you want a job, mostly the jobs are paid well here. And the second one is somewhere where there was a plan to expand Ontario's technology budget to make it easier for IT companies to come in, starting in 2015, or something was 2016. So, I read that. And I remember it caught my eyes like, well, it's better to be there to have to know some people were ready when when this comes. It's going to be huge. And it's coming right now. You can see now, some bunch of technology companies opening up many branches here. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tSo student visa was the last option. The first option was PR. At the time, there was no express entry. So we applied and we got invited for an interview to go to the PR. But the interview was scheduled for 27 months after we got the invitation. So, a little over two years old, we go the invite in 2012 and the interview was scheduled to be in 2014.. Yeah, it was. It was not it was not entirely the express entry. So this express entry is amazing. Back then was like you submitted all the papers. Waited we waited for almost a year to receive an answer. You get an answer and then saying, Hey, we know we like you. But again, we have received your your papers. Now you can come for an interview in 27 months. Express entry started… I think was like 2016,,, should be 2016 or maybe 20, late 2015 that it started. So all of this sort of programs like the Canadian experience class… they existed, okay, but it didn't have Express entry.. So extress entry is just the way you select applicants. But back then before Express entry, you submit something… you wait for a year, a couple years. And then at some point, you get a letter that says “Oh, thank you”. Actually for the podcast. I interviewed one lady and she said that she applied six years. Six years later, she got the invite. So like people are just kind of hoping for the best.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ol:\tWe didn't want to wait. And it would have been kind of we received the invitation kind of at the same time that this president won the election. So, it was like, No, we need to go somewhere else. So, I started looking for a job in my field. But it's really hard to get a job if you're not in the country. So, I never got and I got a couple of interviews, phone interviews, and when I tell them that, and say but I just need a job offer and then I'll get the permit. And they were like yeah, no. It was a little challenging. So, we tried that for a few months. And then we were working with an agency that was helping us with the immigration process. And they said, okay, you have another option. You can go as a student. One of you goes and studies a postgrad program and the other one gets automatically.. they get a work permit. So, so we decided that I was going to be the one studying. My wife didn't want to study. So I took the fall because I didn't want to sit and say I don't like school. So, it's like, Okay, I'm good. And, and we get and I think that process took us like two months. Like from the moment we apply to the college, they said, Yes, like two days. We sent all the papers; we got the work permit and the student permit in less than two months.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tIt was a college. Not university for Human Resources. It was the cheapest program that had a co-op program in the end. I think it served me well, because it certainly helped me to understand the culture, the working culture. Everything that you don't know. When you're back in Mexico, you think that everything's gonna be the same. When you come here is there's ., there’s some subtleties that you don't know until you leave. Yeah. So studying them was really good, like a cover letter. In Mexico we don’t use a cover letter. Tailoring the resume for what you’re applying for, We didn't do that in Mexico. We only use one resume, and just send it everywhere. So those little things I learned by studying that. So I think I'm so happy that I picked that thing. But that was not the reason. The main reason was to was the cheapest way to get there and the easiest way to get a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd in terms of skilled migration, like how do you mean, considering that you are already working in this skilled profession, which is, I mean, software engineering, which is, I think, considered skilled, skilled anywhere in the world. How did that that's sort of like what was the perception at the time When you were going into this course of human resources, like how did you consider that? Or how do you consider now also yourself to be skilled? I mean, the question with this with this, the study is about how do people, how do people self identify as skilled? So how do your what's your identification of skills or skills? Or being skilled?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tHow do I identify myself? I knew it was skilled. I knew I was sure what I was doing. I had been doing project management for software projects, for years. There was a lot of things that I didn't know, at the time. But I don't think my perception of myself is that's really what you're asking my perception of myself, I thought of myself as a skilled worker immigrant I would say. Like, I knew that I had the skills to get a good job and all that. Is that kind of question. Yeah, and I think studying here, the HR course was pretty healthy. Just to, because you know what, it's funny because I don't think it happens a lot in Latin America. And I don't know if other countries but at least in Mexico, it happens a lot that you see people from the US or Canada and you automatically assume that everybody knows more than you. Just because they come from the first world country they do they have access to better and we don't, all those kind of things when you automatically assume that they might be better than you. When I went to school, the good thing is that most most of my classmates were from from here. And I realized that no, everybody's the same. Everybody's human. Everybody has their flaws. And they don't have any. And I noticed that because to be fair, I think it was a it was part of the privileged generation. I was able to go to private schools in Mexico and really good private schools. So, all the knowledge that I have was way bigger than the knowledge that my Canadian classmates had and it's funny because there's things that I knew from Canada that they didn’t know. And we would just start talking about Mexico or another country. They were like, yeah, I have no idea, Mexico is the beach and maybe some kind of ruins but that's it. So I started realizing that my knowledge and my skills were even superior than a lot of people, but not because, not in a cocky way that yeah, I’m better than them. It's just that I think was privileged enough to have a good education. And, and another thing that I always I love, I love learning, always doing things. So, I think that part of myself helped me to understand that prejudice that I've had before was completely wrong. Not because I'm from Mexico, I know less than them. We are all humans; we are here to learn. You're not less than the other ones. It's not that I started thinking on you guys are less. Also, like, you know, speaking English, for me was like, I learned English when I was a kid. And I was like, Oh, yeah, I need to pronounce everything perfectly, or they're gonna make fun of me or no ones gonna take me serious, or I need to write everything perfectly. And then you realize that people don't really care as long as they understand you. \n",

      "\n",
      "Ol:\tMostly me, I'm identifying myself as a leftist libertarian. So for me, even the Centre for me it's a little too right wing. So, but it's kind of like hypocritical because I work in a FinTech company for bank so it’s a little hypocritical. But I am. I'm very inclined to the left. Like very, very inclined to left, I wouldn’t say radical because if you think about the left, even in Latin America usually the left is associated with either guerrilla, in like Colombia, or dictatorships like Fidel Castro or Maduro right now in Venezuela. So, I don't identify with them. I'm more like a let's distribute economically I think Im more leftisit than…I think the world should be distributed equally. I'm in favor of universal global income, I'm in favor of paying a huge amount of taxes if that's going to help, I don't have kids, but if my taxes pay for my neighbour’s education I'm completely okay with that. And I'm not sick. I always been here for six years and I always and I only had to use the walk-in clinic once, never gone to the hospital but if my taxes go to the health of the people, I'm completely fine with that. So those kinds of things that would be my inclination. In Mexico the problem is that Mexico is a very conservative kind of right wing oriented country. So, anything that its center it's considered a left. So I never identified with that.\n",

      "Ol:\tA little bit…not involved. I wouldn't say I'm not politically active but I'm, I used to read a lot, news and not only here but from all over the world. I think Canada is. Canada is a very conservative country. Toronto is a bubble. Toronto is… for me it's great and that’s why I want to do the podcast in Toronto because for me Toronto is amazingly good. You have no 50% people here immigrants and and I even in my job I think Canadians are the minority. We have like six Canadians and 50 immigrants so it's a for me it's a bubble and I like the bubble. That's why I live here. But if you go outside if you go to small towns, it's completely white towns and they're really nice people and then might not discriminate you but they are the ones who got Doug Ford into power. They are the ones who are going to be voting conservative this time. So, it's a it's a polite, it's an open society, but still a conservative society. If you think about it, getting divorced here, you need to, I think be separated for a year or may prove that there's some kind of physical violence. And when you think about the most progressive country even in Mexico, you can get divorce because its like I don't want to be married with this guy anymore. It’s like okay fine sign this and you’re divorced. That's it. So, this kind of things actually made me think.. like even with Europe. Like one of the more progressive countries like Spain, it's kind, its way behind. \n",

      "M:\tIf applicable, which it is in your case. So tell me about all the visa categories you went through from the point of your initial arrival to your current status. And we will include wait times, processing times and any bridging visas or bridging so in Australia, it's bridging visas, but here I don't think that's applicable. We do have a bridge Oh, you have actually applied for that as well. Alright. So that's, that's kind of the show. \n",

      "Ol:\tLet's start from where from here. I have nothing. So, let's say I was here it was in Mexico. And then right now I have a PR in Canada. Okay. So what I did, I started here. So at the beginning based I told you we were doing with an agency in Mexico. So, they suggested to apply for the PR as a skilled worker. So that I would say that happened here. She was like a PR application, and was skilled worker was. Oh, that's another thing and right now you have the express entry and depending on your points, you apply for something. Back then you needed to apply to something in particular. Either you applied for a Canadian experience PR or skilled worker PR. So, you had to pick one. So, we applied for skilled worker. We, when we didn't apply, we were submitting all the papers and or the agency something changed then. This was the, this was December 2009. Okay. Something happened. I don't remember what, but something changed for the next year. So starting in January, there's something changing. We didn't have all the requirements and papers and all that. So we basically discarded this. And then we went just like Okay, now let's apply for PR, but it was for Provincial Nominee. That one was for Quebec. This is the time when we started learning French right, and this happened. I think we did. It was early like January or February when I say February 2010. We applied for this, started learning French and all that, but they told us was like, it's gonna take a while. And when when you get it, you're gonna be, you're gonna have to submit your French tests and all that. So, you have like a year for you to learn French. Because I told you, it used to take a long time to get an invitation and then we just waited. And I don't know, let me check, we were right here in 2013. So, it was 2012 it was the summer of 2012. Yeah. So on the summer of 2012 was let's say, July. So yeah, it took two years. We received the invitation for the interview. And, and this was related to this one [Quebec provincial nomination], but the promise that the interview was going to happen in 2014. So we said like, No, we don't want to do that. And so we asked for options. And he said NAFTA. NAFTA is an option. So we started looking into NAFTA, when there was some North American Free Trade Agreement. So, the problem with this I mentioned is that getting a job from outside the country will be hard. So, this didn't work. Then, it was, was that was our issue I want. No, I'm mixing dates. This happened in 2011. Yes, 20 11 and this was going to happen in 2013 because it was not July was like almost like the end of the year, like October so October 2011 is when we received the letter, then we thought about the NAFTA. And I started looking for a job back then. And I think it took me like six to eight months or something to realize that I was not going to get a job and I was applying it was. But it was the problem with this I was applying the same way would apply in Mexico. just reading it and sending it so didn't work. So then in Well, this actually happened in 2011 and 2012 is when this guy the president won. So this one we said like you know what, we can't we can't stay here. So we applied for the student visa. Well, we started considering, we didn't apply yet. We started considering. So we started considering this, but then I got a I got a I got assigned to a project in Spain. So, I moved to Spain. The original idea was to move in September here. So we're thinking about planning for September. But then this is a great opportunity. It was $9 million project. So, it wasn't really great on the rest of the international experience. It was moving to Spain, I was going to work for the UK. So basically travel between Spain UK for a few months. So I thought it was going to be quite cool, its gonna look great on my resume. So, I cannot. I mean, we can. It's gonna be a six month project. So we can feel we can do this later. We can we can apply for for coming in January or that so we kinda waited. And then we started applying for student visa in October but then I was in Spain so we didn't have all the documents. So, we gave up and decided to apply for April. So, this is what happened. So in April. So, so we started thinking about this we ended up flying formally in well, we actually applied in October 2012. But then we delayed it onto the the summer semester. So I was in Spain from September to December. And then I went back to Mexico and it was kind of crazy because we didn't finish the project. I was working in Mexico but we Spain's timezone. I was waking up at one in the morning started working at two in the morning oh wow and by noon it was done but it was super tired yeah but at the to the story so um so we applied back we applied then we asked the college to not to apply for the winter semester we applied for summer semester and on April 29 2013 we arrived together and this was I had a student permit and my wife had a work permit. So a year past and after a year I got the so it was kind of the same, let's say April 2014. I got my work permit. At the time I got a job. Not this one I got another job that was like a super crappy job with super entry level, really bad job. That was on HR because we have we had in the program, in the HR program, we had a co-op semester, and I got a co-op position in that place. And after the four months as you're like, Hey, we want to keep you they offered me like your shitty salary. And the job was really bad. But I felt at the time I didn't have any options so I was like Yeah, I need to get a job. And also not because I didn't have any options as a person, but because I needed to start building my Canadian experience, because you needed I think, two years to apply for that because back then it was still this program that I was telling you. So when I needed to work for two years in Canada to apply as a permanent residence. So that's why I accepted. But then that worked till 2014 and then 2014 then in 2015 again around the same time in 2015 my work permit expired which was only one year, they only give you the same amount if you work for less than leave us to study for less than two years. They give you a work permit for the exact amount of time they work. But if you study more than that, they give you three years. But I only studied one year so I only had one. Yeah, here is when I applied for the NATFA. And because we already had a job in this company and for the NAFTA, you have to be you have to be working in certain professions. Not all professions can for the NAFTA. But technology is one. So if I hadn't stayed in the other job, I wouldn't be able to apply for the NAFTA. So then I got my NAFTA work permit for another year. Was in one year of two years? Okay, so we got 2018 we got the university in 2017. So, this was two years, so I got it in. Yeah 2015. I had to renew it at some point because it was you had to renew it every year. But I got this one on to like for two years. So you have to renew it. And then starting on early 2017, let's say February. I started applying for the PR. The first time that I applied by myself, I got denied and I got the denial around my birthday so it was May. It's kind of ridiculous when I was submitted all the papers I forgot to upload the translation of our marriage certificate and instead of the saying hey you're missing the translation, Can you send it back? They actually denied and declined the whole application. Yeah, and that's that's when I say that society might be open but you have some people that are still not because one of my friends forgot to upload their passport, which is even worse than the marriage certificate and they came back like hey, we're missing this documents. Could you please upload them? He did and it went smoothly. In my case they just did this. I was really upset. I called them and nobody cared. Yeah, and actually they told me that it's totally depends on the person who's reviewing your profile.\n",

      "M:\tCan you not appeal it?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tI could. Okay, but I do have time because the thing is with the work permit, that you cannot be more than three years with a work permit… temporary work permit. You either go back to a country or you become a permanent residency, right? And if you count this work permit was two years of NAFTA, I didn't have any choice. And the good thing is that the company where I'm still at the they really liked me and they valued me so they hired a lawyer and the lawyer reapplied for the PR and we did this process right after I got to do now which was around my birthday, so say May 2017. We apply for the PR. This time, the lawyers did everything. And nothing was missed. But it's so expensive that if it wasn't the company, I wouldn't be able to pay. I think the bill ended up being like $12,000. And they paid for it, I wouldn't be able to pay for that. So I'm really I'm really thankful. I'm really grateful for them. They couldn't sponsor me because there was some restrictions. And the lawyer basically analyzed everything. And they said, this is the best approach. They did it. And it actually worked because on September 2017 we got our PR. So, you see, it's like, what, like five months or four months. And so, we got all the papers and everything. So, the only thing we needed to do was to go out of the country and return as a landed immigrant, which we did in October. We actually, we celebrate, we took a two week trip to the UK.  We toured a lot of places over there. And when we came back, we landed as immigrants in October 2017.  I think you can, if you don't want to go out of the country, you can schedule an interview with some government agency. And then you can just go there and they do all the paperwork for you, but it's faster if you go out and come back. Most of my friends that I have a flight like that. Most of them have… they drive to Buffalo, and they come back. I mean, you still need to use lead someone to actually see that you're actually the person who’s arriving? And I think the airports and the borders of they already have an infrastructure. So why spend more money having an office? If someone can just like in the end, I think the way they see it is, you're the one who's going to be wanting the permanent residency. So if you cannot go out of the country come back then...its your problem. I think it's efficient. And I think it's saving overheads. And this happens like all the work permits, they just arrive by mail. But the PR, it's different, like some kind of a ceremonial system. For us it was great because we arrived late at night. I think we are flight landed at maybe two in the morning. So, the immigration office at Pearson was empty. So, it took us like five minutes to get the PR card so well they print the cards. So you can well I guess they take a picture of their So did they take the picture there? No, they use the picture that you submitted. So actually, they could print them and mail them to you. But anyway, thats the process. You need to go out and come back. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay, now, I'm going to move on to Yeah, so that's that that's with regards to the sort of timeline and visa categories right. And that's everything will go to the commercial services and things about commercial services you used in your migration journeys, the things that you paid for. So agents, lawyers, which I know that your company paid for in this case. But other things as well. So, education that you paid for career consultants that you may have paid for document translation, skills assessment anything throughout this whole journey that you paid\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tFirst we paid in Mexico for another lawyer which was the one who was helping us to do this because when we started we know nothing knew nothing so so we paid for a lawyer here we had to pay for translations of all the documents in the beginning. We had to pay for a lot of translations because every time you apply, they need IELTS, you need to pay for someone to assess and I think I had to pay now that I'm going to be applying for the citizen I think I need to do the exam again. Anyway, I applied here, then. So, we applied here. We did the IELTS here for English language, then we around here. It was right before we got the invite thing we started we applied…We presented our  I don't remember names for French, French language, French and English. We pay for those. We got here we paid for the college program. It's like three times more than what a resident or citizen would pay - 17K. So it was the cheapest one. But my friends from from here they were paying like four or 5000 so I paid for that. Then I think every time that we applied, I had to have to pay for something it was like for the PR was worse because then you need to get your criminal record check. You need to get your criminal records from your home country as well. You need to get everything translated like everything marriage certificates. All that. What else?...because at the time you had to be for a visa as Mexican, you have to apply for a visa for to enter Canada, so you have to apply for that as well. Yeah, we have to do a health assessment for the PR only. That was only for PR. What else? There were three language tests because they expire in 2 years and I have to do a fourth one now for the citizenship. Because according to but according to the government, you forget the language in two years, I guess. I don't know.  But we did pay for the place to live. What else, what else,  \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo if you remember later on that stuff that you've paid for so so we can move on. Yeah. Okay. Um, so tell me about the role of technology in your migration journey from the initial arrival stage to now. So, what I'm trying to, I suppose here is how did you conduct online research if you were doing and what sort of resources did you use if you want to put them on your map? Social media avenues, or any sort of other online assistance in your migration journey?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tMost of the research done if not all, was done online. I'm very… I mean I am a software engineer, so I'm very comfortable doing that. So, at the in the beginning, my main was like, Google search And I used to check a lot of blog posts, blogs that talk like people. I think I noticed that when people move here, they're so excited. And they want to share their experience. So, they start writing the blog. But then after three posts, they never write anything else. But at least you have the beginning. So, you have something. Social media. Facebook, I would say, Mostly because there's a lot of newcomers to Canada group. So, Mexicans in Toronto, those kinds of things that are completely useless but I checked them. There's there was a blog that was written by... It was from Latin America, maybe Colombian and it was in Spanish then they explained the shock that they got when they went to the grocery store like prices and they were looking for bananas is like there's no banana, because it is winter. And for me, it was like, Where am I going? Then you get here and you realize it doesn't matter if it's winter, you get bananas because globalization, but I just for me at the time, that was shocking because like, where am I going like, if I want to eat pineapples, you cannot eat that unless it's summer, which is a complete lie. So, but maybe they…. maybe they weren't living in Toronto, maybe they were living in one of those small towns that I was mentioning. But for me it was kind of shocking. So, it actually gave me some ideas on what to expect. That I think was a good thing because when I got here, the culture shock for me was almost minimal. It was almost nothing.  Because I already did a lot of research. I used to work with a lot of people from the US so for me, it was not a huge deal. and I like the cold. So, I was okay. For my wife it was a little bit different. But regarding social media, I think the main reason why I think they're useless and mostly when when some blog posts it's a little different because it's someone who actually wants to share their experience, when they take the time to write some social media its mostly someone who knows nothing. x asks a question, and everybody answers whatever they think it's the right answer. So, it's like one person saying, Hey, I'm going to.. okay, remember that one. Someone said Hey, I'm moving to Toronto and I don't want to buy a car. How much should I save for, for public transit? How expensive it is. And to be honest, if you just Google Toronto Public transit, you see the first but someone asked that. And then there are little things like you're going to spend like $300 a month and then someone else is like you can buy a pass it is going to be 100 bucks. And the thing is that because there's so many answers, and most of them are wrong, that just confuse you. So, I gave up with social media, I think at this stage, and most of the most of the research I did after was either blogs that I considered more serious, or immigration lawyers websites. I saw that that that was a lot lawyers, websites. There was a lot of information there. And podcasts, And one of the things I like about the podcast is that I think I only found one that was talking about Canada, Most of them were talking about the the US or Europe. And I found it was people talking about their their experiences, but it was kind of interesting to learn how the shocks that they were Facing. So that happened way before we got here. So we did all the research. And good, I would say most of the research was done. And also the CIC website. The Canadian immigration one - That one I think I checked in every day like anything that happened is checking. And news from the global mail. I subscribed to the global mail for a bit in Mexico, just to learn a little bit of a culture and stuff like that.\n",

Okay, Google Maps helps you. But the thing about the phone right now is that it's a small computer, you can just make phone calls with it. But I would say the most important thing between my laptop and my phone, I think those saved my life when I got here. Even for because I came as a student, I needed to take notes, work, something is just my computer. But in the day to day, it was mostly my phone and like, have a Google Maps.

It ended up I mean, they're super expensive. I remember these guys because it shocked me the the cost at the time. There was another one. But it was around when I was in Spain. So, it was around this time here. Around this time, I found it when I was in Spain, and I found it and I remember it was so good that I sent a link to my wife. It was great. It was a Lawyer, but he had a blog in there. And every, every week or every two weeks he posted something about Canada. Canadavisa.com. Okay, so I guess it Yeah, it's kind of famous. Yeah, I remember I saw it when I found in Spain because I had nothing to do with my wife state and Mexico. She was like, Yeah, I was doing research. \n",

      "Ol:\tMy family in Mexico. It was about my mom and my sister and my dad a little bit. But mostly when I talk about my family, its my mom and sister. I don't think I ever hesitated coming here because of them but it affected me because we're really close. So just one example we used to go to do have a coffee every week, like my mom after work, and then my sister arrived and then I arrived and it was like a ritual every week. Those little things affected me. And it was over here like Around this time, she was like my family. And I have a group of friends that we've been friends since University and we used to play video games together and play dungeons and dragons together,  like nerdy stuff. But we used to do it every week, every Thursday. So that was one of the things one of those rituals that you know you're not gonna have even when I moved here when we when we moved over here. So when we moved here I started to keep the show my d&d group these guys we started playing Dungeons and Dragons online. So they met in one of them's house and they just put a computer with my face there. It was fun, and I think is one of the things that I needed to still feel that I was in. Yeah, one of the good things is that I'm, I'm a very social person, but I really, really enjoy time with myself. So the first month when we got from April 29 to early June, I didn't have a phone. So, my birthday is in May 26. So, nobody called me on my birthday because there was no phone to call me. And I really enjoyed that month of having no connection with the world. I really enjoyed it. I don't know if I would do it again. But I really enjoyed it. So, focusing on another thing I was starting school was But anyway, those kind of things. One of the things I think helped me a lot is when I started when I started school at George Brown. People here were really friendly. There was like half immigrants, half non-immigrants. And and, and we started hanging out from time to time and all the things that I was way older than most of them. So those things as like, hey, let's go clubbing and I was like no Im not doing that. So those kind of things played a huge role. And another thing when I got here I one of my ideas of one of the things I wanted to do was to blend into the pot, I need to blend into the Canadian culture. So, I remember I was telling my wife that I'm not gonna talk to anyone who speaks Spanish. You're the only one and just because we're married but I actually avoided Spanish speaking people because I wanted to, to improve my language. That was the main reason because I thought if I start hanging out with Mexicans, then I'm never going to be speaking English so how can I improve. How am I gonna get there? How am I gonna get the job. How am I gonna give it all back?. So, I avoided that. So my wife started, my wife was a little different. And she wanted to have some connection with the Mexicans society and the culture. So, she started hanging out with them. So most of the time I spent with the only people were talking Spanish with was my wife and my friends from here and my mom and my sister. Here I tried not to and it took me maybe a year to start realizing that I was being an idiot, so I started just hanging out. Now I don't care. The time it was my my idea was like, I need to do this because I when I moved I was 35 is like, boy, I'm already 35 I need to get a job, I need to to make things work for me right now. Because if not, I'm going to be 40 and then I'm going to still be in a shitty job. That was my idea at the time. \n",

      "Ol:\tThe main challenge that I got was when I had to get stuff from Mexico. Yeah, like it was for the PR. It was it was actually around this time after we got approved. There was a lot of stuff that we had to get from Mexico like, criminal record so bad. It's a pain because you either had to fly there and do it yourself or fill out bunch of papers to do it. And I'm completely forgetting something here, between the NAFTA and the PR. I got a bridge permit. Bridge corporate. So what happened is that my NAFTA was, was going to be expiring in May or something or April or May because every year, and but so we need a bridge work permit. So we apply I applied, actually the company did it because it was around here. So between this, they only need to say you need to apply for the PR, and you need to submit the documentation to reapply it and you get a bridge work permit. So I applied for that. It was kind of optional. But because there's another thing that's called implied status, I don't know if you've heard about now. So if your Work Permit expires, but you're already applied for the permanent residency you're legally working in living in Canada. But and it's but you cannot leave and come back you need to stay in Canada. But in this case, the one that I applied to the bridge, it's a permit that allows you to go back and forth. They need to travel. So I couldn't stay here because because work I need to go back and forth. But I have friends that they weren't able to go. They didn't apply for this because it costs money right? And when you're in my case, didn't matter because my company was paying for everything. But it costs more money and you're an immigrant usually are counting every penny so I have friends that didn't apply for this. They waited for a few months between their work permit expired all that and they couldn't leave the country. Actually here's a sad story. One guy that I know his father died and he couldn't go back to Mexico. If you leave, you need to wait outside the country to a resolution. it has it's flawless. Its getting better I think with the express entry and all that's getting way better. It's faster. Like if you think about it in 2010 or 2011 we applied, and it took us almost two years to get an invite for an interview two years from then. And if you think about it, I got the approval in four months with express entry. So, there's improvement. Express Entry started I think it was don't quote me on this but I think it started around here is when express interest started. \n",

      "Ol:\tI think, honestly, I think my path to get the PR was very smooth. Because even though I had to go and go through all this work permits, I always had support from either my wife because she was making the money to pay for things, or the company. They didn’t sponsor me but they paid for lawyer. So in this sense, I would say I was very lucky. But because there's people that I think our issue was when wanted to go to leave Mexico as quickly as possible. That’s why we actually went through all this. If we didn't, we were like, okay, we'll stay in Mexico for a couple more years, then we would just get the invite for the PR, and then we just come in. And that's it. Yeah, we wanted to leave quickly. So we went through, I don't know how many work permits. So, the student permit, then the work permit. Then my two NAFTA permits, my bridge work permit, then my denial of the PR and then the PR. So I think I went through all the permits available. Laughs. But I mean, I suppose that the benefit of getting out of Mexico like and I would do it again.. For us was more important to leave the country than to do all this. I mean it’s a pain. Every time that you need to apply for a new work permit its like let me resurface all the documents that I sent last time. You need to keep track of every trip that you did. I used to travel a lot for work. So, it is a pain. I tried to avoid going back to Mexico. Mostly because… there's two things. Firstly, I hate spending my vacation in Mexico, because if I spend money and time and vacation days I want to go somewhere new. And second,  it's very stressful to go to Mexico so well, family My family is very close. Not my close family but my extended family - like my aunt's my uncle's, my cousins, and my wife's family like we get there and everybody wants to see which is super nice. It's really nice. I really love that, my friends is that where are you coming? Let's grab a coffee let's grab a beer. But that means that every day for as long as you're there, you have something to do. You have breakfast with someone, lunch with another person, dinner with another person, drinks with another one, coffee with another one. And then you met like five or six people on a day. And you get home and we should because one time we tried to stay at a hotel. And my mom was like, she felt that we dont want to stay with her. And we ended up cancelling the hotel and staying with our families. And that's the thing like you have to be with them. So, there's no time. There's no time to relax. Yeah, so that's the stressful part. Also, Mexico is growing violent. It was violent. It was it was the crime rate was really high when I left. Now, it's worse. So maybe It's the same amount crimes the problem is that there are harder crimes. Like before you someone like I got, I was mugged five times in Mexico City which is normal. I don't like I don't know anyone that lives in Mexico that hasn't been mugged or something. That’s normal. The problem is that when that happened I was younger and all that, they beat me a couple of times to take my wallet. Now people have started killing people to take their wallet or their watch or the car so I don't want to get killed because I'm driving a car. So those kind of things. And, and even before we started this, I was talking to one of my friends and he said he's a professor of one of the public universities in Mexico. And he was telling me like he was in the public transit to one of the one of the campuses, which is in one of the poorest parts of Mexico City, and someone can came, went into the bus with a gun and basically said, Hey, everybody give me what do you have. It's one of the poorest neighborhoods in Mexico City. How much money are they going to have? So, my friend just gave them their phone. And it said that it's criminals taking money out of the poor. And that didn't happen before. It was usually the crime didn't happen in poor areas, because the poor don't have, they don't have anything. So why would you not them? Now it's getting there. And now you see if you open a newspaper from Mexico, every day you have people killed somewhere at a party at a restaurant. So, going back for me and just living that it's kind of stressful.\n",

Here's great because it actually, if I didn't have this, this is one of the things this is what I was telling you about taxes and if I hadn't had this, I think would be in Mexico right now. Because we were struggling. We were living on savings like be even even though my wife got a job look like it was a really bad job. Not a bad job was like an entry level job. Almost minimum wage. We had savings and and all that. Toronto is really expensive and you compare it any city in the world, but if you convert to Mexico, it's usually expensive, like back in Mexico. I had a two bedroom apartment and it was paying about, if you converted to Canadian dollars maybe like $400 in a really nice. When we got here we got a one bedroom in downtown for 1600 so it was four times and because that's that's one struggle that we had actually when we got here and actually I think I should mention when we got here we didn't know we didn't know anyone. So, when you apply for to be to rent, place they want you to get a warrant or because you don't have any credit score, any credit history anything. And because we didn't cover until we have to give six months, six months, six months rent. That's a significant amount of money. It was huge for us. It ate not half but about 30-40% percent of our savings. You get it back but promise that you you paid the deposit for. So you get the deposit here. And then this is a year, right? So, in theory, it's six months, right? But you need to create month one, month two, month three, month four, month five, and then the deposit starts counting here. So, you need to pay for six months and then keep paying the rent for the next six months. So, in the lapse of six months, you spent what you would be spending in a whole year. So, and that that sucks. Right now, one of my friends just moved here from his from he was living in Boston. And he was he just moved here, and they were asking you for four months in advance. So, I told him Don't do that. I'll be you want to just please don't destroy the apartment so spoke to me. But I helped him because it's ridiculous when you're moving from a country that it's not this expensive it just it just hurts. It hurts you really bad. We found an option with Scotiabank. Scotiabank has a huge presence in Latin America. So they had an option called smart drivers, it was some program. If you open an account in Mexico, you could move all your money without paying any fees or anything. So what we did we open an account in Scotiabank, Mexico, we just move all our money there. And then the week before we moved here, we just move all the money here. So we didn't pay any fees. That was great. That was one of those great things because if not, then we were basically screwed. That's another thing when I said that its conservative and, you know, elitist. Yeah, because you asking like, okay, you want to move here first, you get points because you have a university degree, you get points because you have experience working, you get points because you all that stuff, you come here to do this thing, you're young, and you need to have money to do this kind of things and all that. So that leaves most of the people who actually need to leave their countries behind. So, I was fortunate enough to have savings, to have a degree to have experience all that, that I was a good candidate for Canada. But if you live in Mexico and you're not by you know, you weren't able to go to school, you weren't able to go to private school and you don't have a good job, you’re screwed.\n",

      "M:\tNow, what are the sort of next steps for you future? What are you going to do now? Like next steps in terms of migration next steps in terms of life course as well? Like, what are you looking forward to?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tnext steps like a generic next step like life, professional life, profession, and migration. Yes, I'm trying to apply in January for citizenship. And the reason is because in October, we it's two years. I'm pretty sure you know this, but if you were temporary residents before, you're going to remember, isn't it? You can get like a bonus one year from before. So it's one year from before plus two years and permanent residency. And the idea for me and my wife would be, so this up to so in January 2020 we want to apply for citizenship. So that's the migration thing. After that, I might stay here. I want to stay here. I would like to run every like the city. I really like the quality of life. But then again, it goes to who just saying like you. I love living in downtown, because it's super convenient. But so expensive. It says like, the problem with that is that it goes with what we were saying is that you need a, really, really good job which pays a shit ton of money. So it just goes around with I was saying like, if you have money then you get the best of the city, which I'm fortunate enough to have right now. I just think I've been really lucky with my path here. The job that I got the company I'm with when I joined over less than 20 people. Now we're like 60, and I was able to grow with the company. So, I started as a product manager. Now I'm a senior director. So I mean, I think that's, I was really, really lucky to get that. So that gives me the opportunity to live here to earn enough money to to enjoy Toronto. If you don't have any money, don’t have a good job, you have to live somewhere far like Scarborough and you need to take the Go train in the morning and you need to get here and youre commute is like an hour and a half. Know that. So those kind of things is it just goes back to what I'm saying about it's a really embracing culture in the lab, but it's still very elitist. You need money, you need studies, you need to be young, you need to be a certain type of person to actually enjoy the city. I never wanted kids. So this is now. So, as I said, January 2020, is citizenship. We're planning to buy a home maybe this year hopefully. We've been saving through to for example payment. Again, we want to live in downtown so it's even more expensive than I think so we're looking into I think, because we want at least a one bedroom apartment were you talking about like over half a million dollars so so I saw one that I loved was a two bedroom plus den, two bathrooms was a $1 million plus den. You know what, like the you know, like, for example this in my apartment is you enter here. This is the kitchen. Yeah. And we have a sink here and it's open and then you have kind of like the living room/dining room. And then we have a door here and then we have the bedroom and here is the washer. A den is basically a space where it's open. There's no door. And you can use it as a small office or guest room but it has no door. Okay? That's the definition. It's like, Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be mostly for us. So we're gonna be like a small office. Oh, that's what we're looking looking into it so we want to buy a condo. I wanted to be one bedroom, plus den. That's that's my idea. As I said downtown. That's something that I think we have enough money to for the down payment and start something that Let's see, this is really expensive. Professionally, I like my job. So I'm pretty sure I'm gonna stay there for a while. So I would say by professionally, there's no change. No change. But I'm doing side projects. So that's one of the things that have been missing. I started the podcast, yeah. And then continue with that. My goal is to interview 100 immigrants. Maybe after 100 I give up or not, but that's the goal. It's in two years. I wanted to meet 100 people. And I'm also writing. One of my short stories is going to be published soon. It's It's it's a parody of an immigrant from Mexico. So his name is Jesus because it makes it it's a very common name, but it's spelled Jesus. So, people make fun of his name because they know your name is Jesus in, in an Anglophone country, nobody's going to be named never gonna name the baby Jesus. Jesus is very company. He needs to explain love of Mexico that and then he is getting a job interview for an entry level job, but he's very stubborn and arrogant. So he doesn't want to get an entry level job. He thinks that he's the Big Shot. He's been a year without a job because he's looking for the top. Like, he's gonna He's going for the major leagues, but he doesn't have the skills and nobody wants to hire him. And then he gets divorced. It’s a take a very dark humour. Its being published by the immigrant writers association. So actually, if you listen to my first episode of podcast, I don't know if you listen to you listen to the first one. The first one, I interviewed the founder of that.  So it's funny because I started it just from college, I started taking a vacation program in creative writing. And I started writing that as, as part of the, of the school project. And at some point, I became a member of this association and they launched, they were asking for people to submit their stories for because they want to, they wanted to create the first anthology and it was going to be stories about immigration. Like I already have this. I just need to polish it and send it so I worked with some of my friends from school, polished it and sent it. They liked it. And it's gonna be one of 10 chapters in the book. I started writing of a young age, but I never pursue writing as a career. My mom is a writer, my sisters writer. So for me was just like, normal. I also take, I am like an amateur photographer as well. So, I do a lot of those kind of things. So yeah, that's, that's another thing. I'm going to continue pursuing my writing right now. Right now I'm writing a novel as well. So, I'm going to say novel. Yeah. Most of my short stories are like that. And like, I try to make people laugh, but my novel is a sci fi action dystopian novel. So it's a little different.\n",

      "Ol:\tI could, um, yeah, absolutely. I just would do it a little different. I would. I would be, I guess, I guess the difference right now. I wouldn't be escaping from my country. So if I consider something now, I would think a little more and maybe don't go the way I came like, I left everything and lets see what life gives us here. I think if I move somewhere else I would be a little more careful and be like okay I need a job I'm going to go get a job and it has to be something that is really is fulfilling not like the first job I have something that's fulfilling and but I would consider I would completely consider moving and there's places that I would love to move. Mostly Europe, Europe, mostly UK. I would love to live in the UK. London To be honest, is my favorite city in the world. So that I haven't been so yeah, I would imagine it would be great. I've been there so many times. So many like three before four times. But it's still like you think about me like I I don't come from I my family's not wealthy. That also made the first time I left Mexico. I was 27-28 I never left my country and there was 28 years old.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tCuba.And then the next time I left was when I was I got married to my wife. And no, no, before we got married, we wanted to cruise to the Caribbean. So, the second time, and then we got more many more here and then I started traveling a lot. But what I'm trying to say is that traveling is are quite expensive. So I never did it when I was young. I never, I always dreamed about we're going to grab a backpack, I'm going to tour Europe with a bag, but I never did that. So now when I travel, I travel with a backpack but it's different because it's now because I know that I have a job that I'm coming back to a job at the time. It's like I'm just gonna grab a backpack in travel the whole whole Europe and maybe Asia for for a year and see what happens but never never did it. Yeah, but yeah, I would consider migrating but it just would be a little more. I wouldn't say careful because I think it was careful with me here. I think it would be more picky in the sense that it has to be a place that I really want to go, and I need to get a job I really want. And that's like kind of like I actually got a job offer a few months ago for the US, California, And I said no. Two things first, I didn't I didn't want I don't want to leave before I get my citizenship and also in the United States, and it's not a good time to be Mexican in the United States, even though I don't have Mexican. And my accent is, I have an accent but its not that Mexican-ish. So I will be okay. And it's California. I completely get it. But still the US. I don't want to live in a country where you have Trump as president.\n",

      "M:\tI mean, if you if you have nothing else to add, but I suppose I have I always have this final question when people draw a map. How do you feel looking at all of this now?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ol:\tWell, first I feel…I feel like really happy. I never I mean, I knew I did all this. I knew I applied to all this things. But I'm, its the first time I put it in somewhere and I can see it. It's like, there's so many steps that I did to get where I am now. So yeah, it's like, Wow. I remember it was it was it was very stressful. Every time that my I think the most stressful times was when I lost my job. And I knew I needed to get a job by June, or may or the summer because my work permit was expired. And I  needed to get a job in my field to apply for the NAFTA extension. That was so stressful. And now that I look back I was like, I was like I feel like, it's it's a strange feeling because it's physically like I want to cry because I remember those times I remember how stressful it was but also I remember the time when we got here. And we had we didn't have any furniture and we were sleeping in an inflatable mattress because we were waiting for the furniture to arrive. And like just a feeling of a fresh start was so invigorating. If you look at the picture of me when I arrived, and a picture of me two months before in Mexico City, I look like five years older in the in the in the picture from Mexico City. Like I think the stress in Mexico. You know Everything just made me look way older. Oh my god, I felt so renewed and all that. And I remember thinking, it's like nobody knows who I am here. I can be whoever I want. I have no baggage. I can do anything I want. Yep. And that's feeling I think it was. I think only someone that's actually gone through the migration process knows what it feels like. To look at this and that kind of reminds me this time when we started deciding because which we actually the reason we we started thinking about moving was because I had a company in Mexico we went bankrupt, lost everything so it was like shit, I need something I need a fresh start. So it's kind of tired of the whole thing. So it's just looking at this is just has been quite a journey. Has it been worth it? Yeah. So I mean, that's that that's that's the thing, right that happy at the end of it. So that's good. And yeah, um, look, I mean, I, I don't really have any more questions, you've pretty much covered everything but is there anything that you you think I should have asked that I didn't ask? I suppose the one thing that I do maybe want to talk about, is you providing advice. Do you give migration advice to people? I suppose through your podcast, that's one avenue that you do. I kind of do through podcast but I just started with this good podcast. Before, I'm usually very open to anyone who like for example, someone contacts me through LinkedIn. I always reply and say like, Hey, can we have a coffee? Can you tell me? I just thought I was them at some point. So I know. I know the struggle. I know the desperation that you feel that this is not going the way I wanted it to go. So, Yeah, I'm always open to that. And that's the reason why I started the podcast. Because I wanted to give something back to. I would, I would. I think what I want to say is like, I would want to give back what I would like to have would have liked to have back then when I started the migration process. Like someone, and that's what I'm focusing on the stories of normal people's like, everybody's struggling. You're not the only one with the issues. Yeah, everybody has issues.M:\tSo let's just begin with when you say Don't worry about this yet. We'll get started later. But when did you first migrate to Canada? \n",

I worked with a corporate for three years and innovation, digital innovation and change management. Then I moved to a news channel Hum News and I joined as an anchor person. But while I was there, I had met my husband, so I realized I probably wouldn't be able to go through and it was wrong to the channel. So, I changed my role.

But once you've left, getting back in with a job is more difficult than yours there as student and continue to find work. But yeah, I think Just it worked out.

So the initial one was actually a visit. So I did come on a visit visa. And then when I came here, i came early summer, so that's a good time to come to Montreal. Just grew on to me, and then I contacted my work people and everybody and I was just like, I think I'm going to stay here. I don't think I'm going to go back.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tYeah, I did. I did do like when I was applying for the immigration initially, I did do the skills thing. So, I think I used to score something like, for Canada, I don't know what the minimum is. But it used to be something like 150 to 160 points, which was well above the average mean. So, I don't know what that means. If that answers your question. Okay, So in that sense, like, because I have a very diversified portfolio of work, so I don't have like, I don't I don't think I'd be able to say like, I have a skill in like carpentry or so but I do have like very strong editorial analytical skills. I have writing skills. I write a blog for one of these non-profits which works on mental health. I'm working with this other non-profit which works with foster children. So I helped to give them life skills such as just being a budget and you know, preparing the resume. So, I have those I have. I have mentoring skills. And so yeah, because I'm more of a generalist, it's something that I can I can fit in a lot of areas, basically. Yeah. So, I don't know, if I start to list them down. I feel like it's gonna be kind of like tooting my own horn. But also I know that it's multifaceted. Right so like I mean domestically I think it's I pretty much do everything I can I change the bulbs. I can I cook I clean? It's a Yeah, I don't think there's except for like heavyweight. I'm pretty adept at everything that goes on in our place. I'm also one of those people who changes like the electricity voltage things and like makes a three pin plug to a two pin plus do that stuff like that. So that and technologically I'm pretty good technologically just get it mixed up. So I like that's a natural inclination to it.\n",

      "Az:\tI don't think I feel that too much because I just I was very independent when I was home as well. So if you like, yeah, my mom came to visit and that was good. She was here for a couple of months. And that flew by pretty quickly. So I feel like I was already living one person then now I'm still living with one person. It's just different in the sense that this person I'm getting to know more and more every day. Yeah. And because he's a guy and I feel like in all of my childhood, because my father also passed away pretty early on the only male presence, I had was my brother’s. And he also left pretty early on like when I was just 20. So I don't really remember much about guy habits. When I moved here I was very like, interesting to me. And I thank God that I have a brother because when I used to visit his house in London like over the summers I get I'd start to clean up this place and then I'd have to stop myself that I'm on vacation and I'm here to do this. So, women generally I feel like just have a natural inclination to be more organized and more clean or like keeping a place a pretty good. Yeah, so what I moved here like my apartment was full of boxes. And I asked my husband if he just moved in. And he said, No. And he had told me before he came that he was cleaning up the apartment and because the lease was ending, so I thought he packed it up. But it turns out, that's how it used to be like, forever. There was just boxes everywhere. And, and I also realized that he has a very different way of organizing things. So, this is the closet. It's a closet. Now, it doesn't matter if it's in the kitchen, or the room or the bathroom. It's a closet. So, you will find things which will be like, Why is this here? And then you realize it's a closet, it doesn't matter where it is. So, there would be things completely like the kitchen drawer would have like tools in it, and I’d be like shouldn’t this be anywhere else except here. so I realized like it was a bulb which went off in my head when I realized  that for him a drawer is a drawer. It's not where it is. It's just a drawer. It's a place to put things. So he, in general, he does agree that he's a bit weak at organizing, but he but for me, that was a completely new way. So I realized like, and for him, like, if it was messy, and he was fine, you know, he didn't really like even if it was a bit dirty. He was still fine. It didn't really matter to him basically. \n",

      "M:\tSo awesome. Great. Okay. So we'll go into the mapping part of it. I do want to clarify that at any point, if you don't want to answer something, or you think that you want to remove that from the transcripts, that's completely fine. We can do that as well. Okay. So, all right. So I'll basically as You two questions and you will just draw it out. And then this whole thing will be recorded, and we can talk through you talk through your drawing. Okay? The drawing is completely up to you; however you want to do it. So from the initial sort of point of leaving Pakistan, I I in your case, I suppose it is about going to study as well in the US, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tWell just to mention I grew up in Africa. So, I moved to Pakistan when I was eight years old. So, for me Pakistan never really felt like home. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tExcellent. So let's put that on the map as well. So let's just talk about all of the places that you've been and all of the kinds of statuses like the visa status that you've been okay, I guess that's Let's begin with that. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tOkay, so all right. So lets just make like...That's Africa. That is Asia.. Here is your Australia and I have no clue what North America looks like it says this big blob over there. So, here is my.. Botswana. Yeah. And then here would be Pakistan…here is going to be Philly and then we're going to move Montreal so those are the four countries well that's a city where I have lived in USA, Canada should be in red. Okay, so that's that's Africa. Yeah, Asia. So, in Botswana I was there for zero to seven years. Pakistan, I moved in 1992 to 2011 and then from 2013 to 2018. Philly is 2011 to 2013. Canada is 2018 to now. \n",

      "\n",
      "Az:\tMy father was working there before I was born. my mom was expecting me. So he moved there, and he thought it was was good. and then he was able to call us. So I was still like about three months or so when we moved there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo yeah. And do you remember like what it was like? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOh, you do. So yeah. Oh, that's amazing. Awesome. All right. Okay, now we'll talk about your sort of migration journey. I suppose this might have to do more with your education in the US and also with Canada and moving so I wanted to ask you about commercial services that you used throughout. So, things that you paid for, which are legends, lawyers, document translation services, language tests, internships, anything that you had to pay for in your move, maybe more recently, maybe either Canada or both Canada and us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tOkay, so here [Botswana] it was not paid for. Yeah. Okay. And over here. This part is also not paid for [US]. Yeah, because you're Yes. And this part when I got to get here  - GRE. And the TOEFL. GRE is to get into any school and TOEFL is because even if you had an English medium education, you're going from Pakistan so they need to be able to tell. So at some point, though, I know that I did take the IELTS X 2. Once way earlier when I was thinking of immigrating to Australia in around 2009, I think okay. And once I took it right now, when I was thinking of coming to Canada So I was twice because that's a requirement for Yeah. And then when I moved to Canada, we consulted with the lawyer twice. But I did all the paperwork myself. So just a lawyer fee, which was, I don't know, $200 for 100 for every time so it wasn't too much. So yes, but every country I have visited in my life. Yes. Okay. Visits is equal to visas paid for. And that would be about – because it’s a Pakistani Passport. So I pay for every country's visa, right. So it's going to be at least.. I paid for at least like 30 countries..30 times. So that's a cost, but I have never consulted anybody for paperwork. That's only in Canada – background checks. Because of my immigration. That's all because to the US, I was on a scholarship from the US Department. So, I got waived for a lot of the costs than anybody else was going to the US to study…they would have many more of the loops and hoops. So, for me till now it's the lawyer, the police, The medicals, not yet, if they asked me it's not necessarily for everybody. When you do your PR it's a spousal one so it depends. Some people …they skip. Oh, yeah, I did do it. For the Australian visa I did do the medical test for the visit visa. No, they made my mom do it. Not me. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay, and what about the immigration to Australia? Like, did you like what happened to that? Cuz considering that you were thinking a move in 2009 I got the in 2010. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tIn 2010 I got the scholarship. So that fell through. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay. All right. We'll move on then. Tell me about the role of technology in your migration. And what I mean is everything that you use tech for. So online searches, what resources you used, what social media you used, your own a particular groups. Also what technology you use. Today maybe to navigate in a new place you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tSo, all of this - 1999 onwards is all tech dependent. If there wasn’t tech, especially in particular internet, I wouldn't be here basically. So what I use right now - let's go backwards because it's more fresh - Now I use Facebook for Canada spousal group, spousal support group. Its excellent. Nobody posts any junk on there. Then theres an online support group. These guys on online support group you can just post a random question and but you may or may not get an answer back I'm forgetting what the name is but it's anonymous support group “apply Canada immigration” something like that yeah some days it comes up as a first search what you do it. After moving here or even before moving here so always flights are always looked up online, flighthopper is a great tool, visa requirements are always looked up online, college applications, full bright application, undergrad, all of that work, Almost, except for the employments I created myself on the, job applications. Even like when you find your way just general maps Yeah. Kajiji for a lot of shit. Even if like right now like the blog I work for a link to community management stuff that I do. I helped organize it's all Online. So, it's because I'm new in the city and I don't know many people. So, everything that we are finding and my husband is more of an introvert he doesn't know a lot of people. So, everything I do is like, by going online, do it. So if I didn't, that's what I feel like I feel like if I don't even understand how women did this by doing these moves before us. Like I don't know what they went through because they'd write home a letter in the received one like a month later. So I just absolutely have this amazing respect for what they’ve actually been through. If you're depressed. Are you looking for something else? You do this? You know? That's where you turn to either. Just place a search. The world's at your fingertips? Absolutely. So for me if there's no net, there's no life, basically.  I mean, I met some people somebody, like, met through the net. I found like a job fair. I'm coming back and I'm going forward. So on the job for found one, I made one lead and went to one of their sessions. And that led to two leads. And that's how I think it goes through basically. So that's one and then one of the social works that I do. I found it was recommended by a friend who knew about them – Vent over tea. I love this place. Its mental health places. Basically, you go online, you book a venting session with somebody who's trained in active listening and you get an hour. I write a blog for them. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd do you think that language plays a role here because considering that Montreal being a very French part of town…\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tI think when you're new here you think that French is absolutely essential. As you leave here more and more you realize it's not that essential. You see job opportunities and you get disheartened because most of like all of them always say bilingual, but you realize that through experience that is by law, there are required to write that on job descriptions. When they write bilingual they are actually looking for somebody who speaks English. So, but I have learned French. I am still learning and I manage to have a basic conversations like shopping in French, I can talk to people, I can tell directions, like shop for groceries or anything I need. So yeah, I think I've picked up the language\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tGreat okay and where do you learn French? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tOh, so first I was here at the YMCA for like two months and then I realized it wasn't helping me much. Then I joined one of the we works and that was all right. Now I move towards more government different places so I go to of archives national Quebec what's called a bank OBNQ. So, I go there for classes which are free once a week, which are only in conversation for French. And then I do at Dawson college, I go Mondays Tuesdays. The Dawson ones are not free, but they're almost like, what they asked for is very small. When I went to the summer, to the ones which the government offers, they told me my work permit did not qualify for it because it's an open work permit. But somebody I met just now. [Draws] This has saved my life. One of the persons told me that now they do accept it. So because she has just started it. So I feel like the meetup groups really helped. Again, I think if there weren’t meetup, I wouldn't have found a lot of people in a lot of places. The friends I did make though, I found them in my French classes. And so I just feel like the one or two people, friends in recommended, like, oh, you're going to Montreal. You know my sister lives there. And I was already a bit like, because I know me and my sister were poles apart. So, if somebody is her friend, most likely they're not gonna my friend and vice versa. Somebody who recommended me their sister and when I met her, I was just like, I'm friends with you, not your sister. I just it's not necessary. But another friend of mine, his sister moved here and we got along pretty good. So I think it has to do with the fact that he's a male and she's a female. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo I mean, I thought was kind of going to go into the next question that I had is about social connections so friends, family or greater community that have supported you in your move here. And if there's anything that from there that you want to put on your map\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tSo I feel like I am a very independent person. I have always been a very independent person and everybody was, more than advice, everybody was very sure that I'd make friends in no time and then again, you know, I'd be on my feet. When I moved here, I thought I would need friends. But initially, I didn't want to be friends, like look up or go seeking friends. Like, I just wanted to be on my own. Because it was not just a physical, geographical change, but it was also change in my marital status. So I wanted to, you know, understand the dynamic of this relationship I was going to be in. Nobody hands you a JD for how to be a wife. What is it going to be like. And you just pretty mimic what your parents did. That’s the only training manual you have. So, I feel like it would be very helpful if my husband has been more supportive, okay. And I feel like he should have had some tools to help him understand what I would go through…for example, well, because he has his life going on here. And, of course, nobody's asked to reorganize all his life here. But he, to understand that his presence would be important, and in a meaningful way, not just being physically present mentally absent. So I feel like something like that would have been very helpful for me. And if he had, I do believe that if he had known about a resource like that, he would have reached out to me before I came, so that just give me an idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[I'm gonna make a start up along those lines. So I'm thinking about multiple things think that you can use this paper if you want. Okay? Actually, I do keep making notes. So I'm just because I create things myself. That's what I do.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think that's a great resource as well as for anybody who's new, for partners. So before they come in here, because it's it's like I had to find everything, you know, and because I'm a woman, like he just showed me like, heres the pharmacy, heres the grocery store. And the rest was just like, I'm going back to work. So who do I meet? Like, you know, and I feel like also because his and my personality styles are so different. Like, within one year, I feel like I've almost made more friends than he would even like to have, you know what I mean? Because he doesn't have many friends and his friends are not necessarily going to be my friends. And I would rather not because I would like him to have his time doing his thing. So yeah, so I think that it's just really important that does have to be and for me, I didn't know who to reach out to, if I needed support. So even when I went online, I didn't like and it's also I think some of the part of you doesn't really want to admit that you want support. Yeah. So you're, you're not willing to do that in the beginning. So yeah, so it's like any place it's not easy to move to a place when you when you're somebody who's used to having a like a full schedule, and like work, you know, all engines burning basically. And then you just move in this all really down to zero and you also have a perception that it's all French. But it's not. But for me, I like the French perception because it's kind of pushed me into learning a language I always wanted to learn anyway. And for me, it's not just to learn language I can get along it's for me to it's more like to read more books or literature in French and actually get an understanding because it just opened up a whole new world so I already do write like small stuff in French and I manage all right, because I write stories so I write those in French and I find myself thinking in French already. So yes, so language does play a role and I feel like either you would embrace it or let it deter you, and it's all up to you. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tYeah, I feel like he does agree that he could have done a better job, but how he could have done it. He could he doesn't know. And so I don't blame him for that. We’re both lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tBut anyway, alright, cool. Um, how did your decision to move? But I suppose you've kind of answered that before. But do you have a very close connection with your family? And did that affect your mom, for example, that you were moving and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tMy mom somebody who's like, I know that it didn't affect her, but she had, even when I was there, she had a routine. She has a very strong network of friends and family and she's she's…And she did 2 years without me any way. Two years without me when I was in the States. So she kind of like, already knew that. But the thing is, when I was in the States, she was still working. And she retired the year I got back. So, for her, but she still is very regimented. So, she’ll get up at a certain time every day. She has her whole routine. So even when I was in Pakistan, like, if I came back from work earlier, she was like, okay, you're home, but I have things to do. So, we're going to sit together at the time we sit together every day. So, like, and that was good to see because it just showed me that she's going to be fine without me and she is so she's a very, she's a she's a very strong and she's she's because she's so independent. She's always promoted us to be like, you know, raised us to be very independent individuals as well. \n",

      "\n",
      "I do have some more questions that you can potentially think about putting on your map. First, these regulatory aspects of your migration you did talk about police checks and you have put it already but any other government requirements that you have to fulfill so characters or points or health or immigration forums or anything that was kind of very government based that you had to let do get \n",

So, and the guy was like, very sweet. He's didn’t even charge us for it. We didn't even know him. We found him online. But he just said, we also wrote for him but the translation was, so he just had to stamp it. That was here. I mean, we did have to go through Of course, we had to do the PR papers, the PR paperwork and the work permit paperwork. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo the PR paperwork and the work so what's your status now? Are you on a work permit only or PR? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tMy PR is approved in principle. Its called AIP and work permit is to 2021 which means my extension to stay and stuff I have my driver's license, health card everything by now. It took it's time, but it's here now. The paperwork itself is this one is the worst paperwork I've done in my life. I could have applied to five universities in that one paperwork – that’s how much it was because we've been married for less of less than a year when we applied we had to actually prove that this was a legitimate real marriage. It wasn't just done for the sake for getting an immigration. So, we had to give them like photos and they have a cap on photos so we had to be really like smart about the kind of… we had to thik really out of the box in terms of what we give them.. like actual evidence so like we give them photographers contract for the wadding, we gave them permission slips for wedding shoots. The good thing about Pakistan is now that it's pretty becoming pretty regimented and people give you like receipts of the cake, the wedding catering, and everything. So, we had that, and  everything's in English. So we gave them the gym membership for here and then you know that we're both coming here together, opening a bank account they needed…they had absolutely required a joint bank account and me being on a Pakistani passport on a visit visa none of the banks was actually giving us that because they're just like, No, we don't give it to visitors even for joint, so that was like such a catch 22 because we just kept going round and round and I didn't even know which banks were here and then just searching that and thinking out of the box kind of thing. And I basically I think I thought of that only because I had lived in the US and I thought okay they should be able to give me a bank account based on my own nationality and sort of my visit visa and that's how I thought of like an International Bank. So this paperwork’s a bitch, I swear, we have had so many fights and doing this and almost when I went on the support group page, all couples have had fights doing this so we were thinking they should put a checkbox underneath and saying, how many fights did you have one completing this because you're not gonna do this for anybody unless you really love them to be honest. It's that bad. And even though I’m doing inland I think Outland I don't know how land is because you stay away from your spouse most likely for like two years and that is probably hell added on hell. For us because I was hearing a reason you can only set stay at six months stretch. So the deadline was approaching. So it was more like we do this or goodbye. So we were able to like keep our eyes on the prize in terms of like, No, we mean more than the paperwork. This is a mountain a molehill, and a mountain in the way, and because we've been another long distance relationship for six months before we got married, so we, we'd already done that, and we didn't want to go through that again. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "M:\tOkay, great. And I suppose you did kind of mention this, maybe this might have been your biggest challenge. But overall, throughout your journey, looking at your map, what was some of the biggest challenges or obstacles that you would want to point out and put on your map.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Az:\tI feel like in getting here I was pretty okay because I was already like, pretty sick of where I was and I knew that I had to move so in getting here there was not like, for me it wasn't an obstacle to choose like, Oh, you know I love this place too much and I cant give it up. It never felt like home to me and I was perfectly fine moving away. So, and surprisingly the only city in the in my entire life I've lived in four as you can see, and Montreal has actually felt like home pretty instantly. But I feel like the biggest obstacle I felt when I got here was because I have seasonal affective disorder. And the fact that the winter here is pretty harsh and as much as I love the winter actually, s.a.d, plus, my husband's I don't know, lack of awareness of I don't even know how to put it in a good way like, because I don't blame him for it, that's the thing and I don't hold it against him. But his kind of like the fact that his ignorance and him having a full load of work kind of like timed at the same time as winter hitting in, you know, so because his work is very seasonal. And this and the next semester are his main two semesters. So, I feel like his his business or his life carrying on basically which I cannot absolutely grudge the person or Yeah, so his business plus sad so the timing of that was probably like the worst combination. Yeah. And this year, like as it starts to become when you get close to winter, I almost dread it because it's almost traumatic to think that this cannot be a repeat of the last year. Yeah, right. So see, so a lot of people just say that we have winter blues. All right, okay. Right. But then people who have seen winter blues is something like almost everybody faces because the sun is nowadays are getting shorter to get less sun time and everything. But seasonal affective disorder is when people actually almost move into a depressive state. And you have to like, like I had learned to manage it in Pakistan as well because I would you know, up the ante on my physical activity and everything but here there were some essential vitamins which I wasn't aware of, and I should have started taking them…I should have started way earlier. So, I feel like that affected because they affect the chemistry of you. So that and the fact that you know, I didn't know anybody, so I didn't have a motivation to get out of the house. So, I mean, I mean, when it's snowing everybody wants to stay in any way. Right. And it's beautiful from inside, but I feel like it's beautiful outside as well. But if only if you have like, a purpose to get out, yeah, I just didn't have a real and like for me because I mean, I was living right here is a good thing and a bad thing. Because if I had to go to the gym, I would just run from there to here. Right. So I didn't even have to wear any winter gear on something. I just sprint and I'd be in here then I just went out. But I came here I went to the gym. I didn't really talk to anybody. And the fact that I had very low human interaction, and somebody like me who's extroverted really needs a lot of human interaction. So that and then so the human interaction factor, like very decreased and then the time zone change because everybody back home was like, 12 hours at a difference from you. Yeah so even if I go on everybody it like my friends and you know the fact that you know you you're not there and you see lives moving on basically. Yeah, you have that's the negative of Facebook, and social media that you're able to see things happening and you're not there. it's a con in that sense, the connection is not there. Like, your friends are meeting up the way they used to, like you see their stories. \n",

But when you mentioned it, like, I don't think I got good or bad advice. I just didn't get advice. And I think that that itself is not a good or bad thing. Like it may be more of a bad thing, because I just didn't get any advice. I think I feel like either. Everybody just looks at me and thinks that knowledge. Yeah, because I've learned from a very young age to steer my way. So, either everybody's perception of me Is that she should be fine or are they just don't know what to say. So yeah I don't think. I feel like there should have been some something. I feel like my sister in law was had moved to London from to be with my brother. And she like only now like after a year she mentioned that yeah, it feels like you're just you're just reborn you have to do all these driving test again you have, you're basically starting your life is scratch and I feel like, something, a conversation along those lines with somebody would have been helpful. And any of his friends wives that I met, were also not too forthcoming. Now they are not earlier because they didn't know me, or they didn't know him too well. And they didn’t know what to say basically. So, so I feel like it would have, I just feel like there wasn't much conversation happening. That's why I'm taking notes because I am considering of building this on on a side of talk to one of these organizations as well, where I can actually hold workshops and have mentors and stuff. So I’m thinking of doing something for women who are or even men who are place like me. I feel like I've got like so much like, that's what my first blog was about, like how to prepare for the winter, that's exactly what it says. It's about winter blues, basically. But I there's a disclaimer about SAD at the bottom. So, it's basically trying to give those tips to people that I do do now and that have worked for me. Yeah, so it's so I do find a way to like, say those things and communicate them because I just feel like if I had that information, it would have been much more helpful for me. \n",

But I feel like my brother is also more intent on taking her there. So I'm just waiting till I get my PR and I'm able to sponsor somebody. She’ll get more points for her brother being here. He cant sponsor her, I can. So, I'll just I'm just waiting it out to see what the situation is. Yeah, but right now we're a bit like okay, because we know she has a multiple visit visa for the next eight years. So at least that's good.

And low maintenance child. So I think for now, he's keeping us happy. Yeah, I do think I would like to like, find a job. Only because I think what I have, because I'm just so used to doing so many things. I feel like when I have a job in addition to what I'm doing, it just helps me. The more things I have, the more focused I become. And like you can see I'm sleep deprived right now, but it makes me it just gets my juices flowing, or else I can keep sleeping. I'm somebody who can who has slept for more than 24 hours straight. It's like I was sleep deprived. I was working like crazy. So I went to London on my spring break to be my brother. And he arrived at 7am. He took me for breakfast, went to work. I went to sleep at 10am at 3pm I'm getting like a message from him saying, Are you okay? What's wrong with you? Like, I just fell asleep. He's like, yeah, it's 3pm The next day, the next day, my God, wow. I was like, Oh my god, I have so much work to do. But I needed that sleep. I'm a nocturnal person just yeah, I'm a very productive at night. Oh that's great so that's why I stay up like three or four and I'm getting a lot of stuff done but also my sleep is less like four hours of sleep and I am good.

      "Az:\tI'm not too sure if this is actually really reflective of all the things I have actually paid for. Okay, you know, and I think that's an important part because these things are expensive. It's not like they're not expensive. Yeah, you know, just the fees itself is very expensive for the paperwork. But like, I feel like so for me, something that I like about myself is that my education, my entire education, which is 18 years or so, has almost except for two years, it has all been free. So I think that is not like something which other people get. And good education especially right, like I went to an Ivy League school. Yeah, a private school like that. It's, it's so coming out of that debt free, you know. So, the only two years I paid for was two out of four years on my undergrad when I was not on scholarship. So, but I feel like if you don't have all of that education, you would pay much more for it. In all the things that I have done, and a lot of my trips have been paid for. Of the 30 countries I've visited, I didn't pay for those airfares. Most of them were paid visits, either through my work, or through my school or something else. So, because you're educated, you know how to get things. You know what I mean? Like if you want something but you don't have the money at that time, but you have a very big asset, which is education and awareness. And you find somebody who's gonna pay you to do that. I really wanted to go back to Botswana. After like 20 years, having left it as a child. And I went to Penn, I saw the Penn as a Penn and Botswana partnership. I applied for the summer internship and I could have checked all the countries in the world on that actually, and I only checked Botswana and I said, this is the only one I want to go to. If not, I'm going to stay back and I had two internship offers in Philly and I said I'd stay back and I do that. And then they contacted me and said your waitlisted, not shortlisted. Would you like to be waitlisted? I said to myself, hmm waitlisted means no, but I said, I'll take that chance. And, and that's what happened. Somebody jumped out and I made it, you know, I went. So, my 3 months over there were paid for it. You know, so what I'm just trying to say is somebody else would have to pay much more, even if I paid for those visas in many cases. I didn't. even pay for the visas. It was coming from somewhere else. So, I'm just saying that this cost is not reflective of more than average people. This is like an outlier in terms of cost. My brother in law he has, I don't know if this will help you in any way. But he's working on internet for all access, like his mission is to make the entire world have free access to internet, based in San Francisco, and he went to the US on the “genius visa” was the genius visa. It's given to Absolutely exceptional people is a very few brother in law as in your brother in law, my husband's sister's husband, husband, sister's husband, okay. So he, he is he actually is a genius and he was he works with all the start-ups and everything inbox on as well. And so kind of uses like he's our age, but he is a phenomenally inspirational person. That's amazing. So that is his goal. And this this awareness is something that he brought to me that a lot of people, a lot of things I do is only because I have access to internet Yeah, just not having access to them, but also knowing how to use it. Absolutely. So that is an absolute privilege…that's why I just wanted to like give that disclaimer at some point that of the GRE, I took the GRE four times. How many times did I pay for it out of pocket, two times? The only trip I paid for, for the first time in my life was my own Umrah trip in 2009. Before that, I'd been to the US to Nepal to like, other Australia, all these other countries that I'd gone to. They're all paid for by somebody else. And after that, as well, I have there are very few trips in my life I've actually paid for. \n",

He hasn't travelled as many states even though he’s lived longer than me. Even in Canada. I have visited more places than him. Some of the places he’s visited, I haven't like Europe. Yeah.

There is some more and more French Osteopaths in Canada because it's the place where we can work with our French Diploma. I just have to have an association here from my French diploma, but its like a separate subscription. And I'm just going to work with my French diploma. So it's really good because the French schools are really good for Osteopathy than in Canada. I think, maybe not. Better. I don't. Those are better or not.

So, yeah. At the beginning, I would like to go to Australia because I saw all the pictures and photo and I say, Wow, I want to go there. But it was impossible for me, for my for my work. So I think then I did a lot of search on the internet. And there is a website, a French website already good one to a lot of information about the working holiday visa. And then also on the website of immigration, Canadian, immigration, but more on the other side. I just know that I didn't want to go to Montreal and Quebec because there was too much French people and I don't want to be only with French people and then I didn't decide Toronto. I only decided because I have a work and it was easier for me. So whatever the country, if I speak English it doesn't matter for me but Toronto it's a really good city for what my job but there was a lot of stuff to do. It's not so far from America. There is a good airport if I want to travel so it's a good combination. Actually, I work in two clinics, so I decided to live at the middle. But I am at 25 minutes with the subway as a street car so it's it's not so far and I am a junction triangle. And it's on the line too. And I'm five minutes away from the subway.\n",

So I discovered co-living. And I also know that I didn't want to buy a lot of furniture for my apartment. So, it was a really good find because everything is new, and I just have to pay for my food, and everything is included in the price for the apartment. So, it was really good for me, but now I meet my roommate, and it's everything is really good. And maybe we are going to change to pay cheaper, because it's a little expensive, but to start, it was the best decision for me. But now that I met my roommate, maybe we are going to change apartments for another one, less expensive and maybe in the same place, but other apartment. \n",

So there is lots of people and not so many place. Little by little Canada open more places because they want lots of people to come. This is for France. Yes. If I wanted to go to Australia, I just have to pay and go. But for Canada, It's a draw. So sometimes people are waiting for years and never drawing. And I just made my subscription in December and one months after I get it.  So, it was really fast. Lucky draw. So, it's just about chance. It's not about your work that's about your education. So, there is an age it's 35 but You just have to sit and wait you're lucky like me you get it if not you're still waiting. So, I was very lucky. And then after getting my visa we have lots of paper to do like to give information about me, about my family, even my brothers, my job so I have to make medical visits because I have to work with babies and lot of patients so I have to pay expensive for this visits. So, I needed to go to a different province for my visit [medical]. I need to go to Leon for my biometrics, yeah, it was step by step. And I think in April, it was done. I just have to wait for when I want to go, so it was really fast for me. [The draw] Because there was too much people. I think I did in September 19, I did one subscription for Canada. But it's only I think we were around 8000 but its on this day, four place for the last session. So, I did it again in December. And I think if you check now maybe there is still 14,000 people.

I was I it was difficult for me to find working friends. I only do some replacement but only for a few days. I was with very boring in France and I told to my mother That's okay. I can't find a job in France. I'm losing my time. I always want to work abroad, I can work as an Osteopath in NZ, but I can make my subscription for Canada and waiting for drawing. But in the meantime, I can go to New Zealand to work and to improve my English. So, in it was a Wednesday I was on the point to make subscription for NZ, It's like Australia - just pay and go and I said no, I will do that tomorrow because I want to do that quiet and very. Yeah, just quiet because there was a lot of paper and lot of stuff. I don't want to make any mistake.

But I know that little by little it was like more and more so. I paid for flight ticket. But I do Paris and to New York.

It's the website where I find all the information for my working holiday visa, Pviste.net. Yeah, it's like working holiday visa but in French. It's like an extension for the people. It's a really good website and it is for all the working holiday visa. There is like Australia, Canada, NZ. Everything is there, it's really good at the lot of partnership to have some prize. For example, if I did Paris to Toronto, I can use air transact and I have one baggage free. Do you know Skyscanner, A lot, I use it a lot. I will put like that but because it means I during this period I checked pvitste. I checked this website. and now I use a lot of Whatsapp to stay in touch with family and friends ofcourse and Facebook but to find your advice and tips and at the beginning for my apartment. \n",

After this I get in touch with my first boss and I think the second boss, it was in, I think it was in May maybe April-May. It was not a real interview it's just about talking and to see our work and to see our thinking about my, my work and just to know me more and our work and deal with the clinic and everything. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "B:\tSo most important problems at its people in Canada are more open minded. In France it's a generic. But in France, for example, you will see each patient only three or four times in a year, but because they are not reimburse a lot. But because in Canada, there is big insurance and I see each patient maybe every two or three weeks, sometimes more. It depends. But I see a lot of patient every two weeks. And at the first time it was very strange for me, because when they say actually, “when should I come back?” I say “oh, come back. Three to Six months”. Like in France I say. And they are like “Oh, okay”. And I saw that were not happy because I think if I say three or six months, they consider that I don't want to be to take care of them. So now, I do like everyone andI just said, “if you want to come back in two or three weeks, it's okay for me”. But for that I have to adapt my practice. I don't do the same. If people come back in two or three weeks, then if they come back in six months, I don't do the same. It's not about techniques, but it's just about how I see my practice now. I adapt myself, for people in Canada. And I think if I go back to France, I have to adapt again for people in France. So it was very different, but I don't prefer France or Canada for that. Its just different I just need to adapt. \n",

      "B:\tYeah ofcourse. Okay since the beginning, my best friend because I made 10 years ago and since the beginning to those that I want to work abroad and since the beginning she say, “okay, no problem. You can go and nothings gonna change between us and I've seen we are more close now that Im in Canada, because as a beginning, I saw That okay with the jet lag of six hours. Maybe I'm not gonna be able to write to you every day to answer you every day because of my work because of the jet lag because of my life. And actually, we are all we speak every day with WhatsApp with vocal message. It's easier. And yes, really we are more close now than ever. And, of course my family, and mother. Of course my dad but I don't have the same relationship with him and my brothers.  I have two brothers. So the one who lives in Boston Well, we're more… I am close with my two brothers but it was easier for me to speak with Gayle because he’s in Boston and he also left home. So, I will Gayle first. And he was there “just to tell me it's gonna be okay. You can go Yeah, I can do it. Yeah of course because I was alone. Yeah so it's and, and I'm alone and I'm a girl so it's not difficult I seen it was not a program for me. Of course I think about that because I'm a girl but I feel so much insecurity, here than in France. So, I really feel comfortable now with that. And my brother move with his wife and his daughter, so yes, he moves to Boston but he is not alone. If he needs to support he can just go home and he has support. If I need support I have to call my best friend and it is not the same. Im alone. Of course I met some people here but I will not tell them all my problems and my difficulties. So, \n",

      "B:\tarriving here to be alone. All the month of August was difficult, because I don't have a lot of patients. So, I didn't work a lot. I stay home and of course I go outside but I go outside because I told myself okay, you have to move and not to stay in. But if I go to the gym, people don't speak because they are in their own routine I did a lot of stuff. I go to the beach, but alone it's not the same. And I have a big apartment and I was alone because my roommate was not there. So yeah, it was to be alone – in every part – work, at home, outside. Now I feel better after one month. I feel better.  I feel safe in Toronto more than France because when I was studying in Lyon, if I were as well, I don't wear skirts, but a short.. just a short. I know that I will have some… I don't know the word.. well I can't wear what I want in Lyon. I always was thinking about oh, what's going people say, because I'm wearing wearing a short or a skirt? Because they are crazy. They are not open minded and if a girl has a short, it's means that she wants for example sex. Lyon is a big city, but it's like…. it will be the same in Paris. There is types of people of course, but in Lyon it was very difficult sometime because I go.. I will were short and I know that I will have some words on the streets and everything. When I have insults of some people, it was from one community, but you don't have that in Toronto. I can wear what I want. I can make up as I want, I can go to city in a bikini if I want, I will not have any insults or remarks. If you do that in France, Oh my God. Do you know scum? Like that community? That's it was very strange because sometimes you go in a place and you will not expect you to have some insults and you do. So, if at my parents home, it's a small city, so it was not all the time, just sometimes. But in big city if you go to some place, you know that you are not so safe. I really feel safe here. So for example, I go to a party for And if I have to take the subway at midnight, I was uncomfortable and I was always check behind me. I have to wear my air pods. But without music just to show that people that I can't listen, but actually I listen if something happened. In Toronto, I just came at midnight Thursday, and I feel really safe. No they don’t. May be they want because maybe they miss me. But especially my mom, because I'm very close to my mom. But if my mom knows that I'm up here and if everything is going well, she will never ask me to come back. I have news for all my family maybe every day because we have a group on WhatsApp and it's really easy now with the technology. So it was not like years ago, but they are coming just to visit me to to see how I live, where I live, where I work, and how is the city just to discover my new life. But they  are really happy for me so they will not ask me to come back home.  \n",

So the French people of my school especially, and one of the friend of me, because she wants to leave France too, but she want to go to Montreal, but I just explained to her like you have to make a subscription online, you have to pay this. And you can't. You can't find a job before, its only if you're lucky, but it's easier when you are here. And some people like school asked me, How did I get a job and how is the life in Toronto and how I feel. So I give them some advice as they want to come. But first, they have to get the visa in the first place and finish school. just sometime when on Facebook, some people ask if I have the answer, or we tell, but I don't go specially on a group or on a website to give advice.

      "\n",
      "\n",

And it's insurance and this insurance is a partner with Pvtiste. Yeah, there was lot of insurance you have to choose between what you're supposed to need. And I took this one because a lot of people take this one and it was better for what I suppose visit here and it was 800 euros for two years. And for exam Oh, I also like this one because if I only stay one years, they reimburse me. But if I took another one you pay more expensive and they didn’t reimburse. And you don't take for two years your insurance, when you arrive on Canada, they didn't give you your visa for two years. Only one year. So you have to get for two years. Then if you only want to stay for one year, you can ask your insurance to return the money back. \n",

But if I have a lot of patient and if they have lot of patients, I don't see anyone. I just cross them in the clinic but that's all but everyone is really kind. Sometime we make some after work plans together and the evironment is very good and peaceful and I feel really comfortable. The first time I arrived, my boss said, Okay, we're going to do some shop. I want you to feel comfortable in your room. So we have bought some pictures put on the wall. And I said, Wow it will never appear in France. No. So it was really I feel really comfortable and at my ease. And it's the same in the other. And if I have patient most of the time, I see only my patient.

Some people are still waiting for one. You have to stay two years, and I was ready stressed for that. And now I say okay, you have work. You have an apartment. Everything is going well.

When did you first move to Canada?\", '', '', '', 'Mi:\\tIt was 24, August 2009. And I came up with study permit. My whole point was just to come here and get my education rather than settling here or having an immigration experience. So, I just wanted to focus on the education part.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, and what sort of program did you study?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI took the post-secondary International Business program. So, it was a college program. And at the same time, it was a full-time study. So, during this program, I didn't have a chance to work, even though I had the chance to get the on campus work permit, but because of the timeframe, it was a really intense program. I didn't have a chance to work with doing this one year period.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, so and what were the motivations behind your move? Like what what did you consider in making the decision to move to Canada?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tSo that's a good question actually. Not specifically Canada because I would like to start, I would like to back forward with a bit… a bit regarding the Austria experience because I always wanted to have an experience for the different cultures different kind of atmosphere that I could, I would have access to in this case, to gain more, not just the knowledge, not just the experience but to be part of an interaction, human interaction, because and then I decided to go to Austria which was part of the exchange program that I was in. I was doing my undergrad and political science. So, after that exchange program I felt totally different. My old stereotypes were demolished on my mind, which was amazing.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd this was ? Where did you go? Sorry?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tAustria. So it was the year was 2008. So, the year after, I definitely wanted to have a chance to experience different cultures. So, I knew that European culture was pretty much the same, especially in the Western Europe. So especially on also the education system was the same. And I wanted to try either Australia, as I mentioned to you before or Canada. So, the main motivation was, of course, as I said, to broaden my horizons, for not just the educational aspect, but just to learn different cultures to engage with different kind of atmosphere. And I think education was good tool to get myself into that door. So, but making the decision specifically Canada, that was one of my father's friend that he's Turkish, but he got married with a Canadian. So yes, so he was highly recommending about going to Canada but he was mostly endorsing about immigration processes more easier in Canada, but I was insisting on the fact that my intention is not the immigration at first place compared to other like the majority of people. So, but he was still insisting on Australia is tough on immigration. So, you better just go to Canada. And, but the motivation was for me to go to Australia. I mean, for me to want to go to Australia was climate. Of course, it was nice climate, the landscape. The culture itself, have it looked from Turkey from my perspective, of course, I never been in Australia before. Yeah, so I made a decision of course with some of the endorsements from my friend. And also, the second part was there was an educational consultancy firm that they came to my campus when I was doing my undergrad in Turkey. And they did a seminar regarding the education institutions in Canada. So, that was also a bit tempting for me how to education system is good in Canada, I mean, compared to Turkey specifically, and it was also different… not entirely different, but there was certain differences compared to Europe. So, in this case, I would like to I just want to decide to move forward with Canada so that was the main reason.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, great. Okay. And so this is I'm after your undergrad in Turkey and your ethnic background is Turkish?\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI am Turkish I was born in Turkey and raised in Turkey till 21-year-old. And after 21, I went to Austria, the one without the kangaroos. Yeah, that's the joke actually. So, yes, and 2008 was the year. But also, I have, over there because the international student community was so active, I didn't have a chance to engage with the Austrian culture itself. It was mostly field trips, backpacking and similar things. But other than that, I was mostly melted in the same pot with other international students. So, I think I would say it was a better experience for me because it was an amazing experience in terms of having some friendships from South Korea, from Australia to from US from parts of Europe, from Africa, so it was it was good. I mean, I had some roommates from Ireland and Spain. So, I never had this experience before. And it was teaching me so many things, how to share the common space, how to share different cultures and respect each other in certain terms, even though I wasn't accepting certain things at first place, but it's helped me to absorb and respect them. And then the next stage was to gain some cultural share. So, which was important for me, and then I enjoyed it. I enjoyed that time being and then yes, I decided to take the next step. And that was Canada.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo why not Austria itself? Like why didn't you think of Austria as the did you think of it? Maybe?\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI never thought of it. I taught mostly in Europe, somewhere in Europe. I personally, I like Mediterranean countries because of the climate as well as the culture itself is more welcoming in general, again, it depends on person to person but and also, I knew from my knowledge and as well as some of the Turkish diaspora in Austria and Germany, and I was mostly talking with them day to day basis. So their Austrian experience wasn't that satisfactory in terms of racist behaviour in terms of, in terms of the how the integration process was missing and was not welcoming especially the first generation, the law and second generation and third generation they were partially pushing themselves where I wouldn't want to use ‘pushing’ but they would like to they wanted to try to be part of it. But again, the integration whole in Europe is all different country by country. People were thinking that just because of the common language Germany and Austria have the same kind of integration policy, but I think it's different. I found Germany is more welcoming, especially even though the integration fail. It was accepted by the chancellor. I think it was 2006 that he admitted publicly that integration process failed. But even though the integration process failed, I found during my trips in Germany, and also my classmates that who were from Germany, they were more welcoming, they were more friendly, and they didn't make me feel that I was stranger. But I had, I had two Austrian roommates that we were sharing the same building, but they were not that welcoming. And they were not that friendly. But maybe it's just we can limit for that two people. But in general, even when I was going to the supermarket or when I was going to a bar. It was different. I mean, you could sense that. It was a small town which is called, which is named Kufstein, but it's really closer to the one of the biggest cities in the western side of Austria. It's called Innsbrooke. So it's a 15 minutes difference, as you can imagine the differences in Europe is as I mean distances in Europe is not that huge. And there's a connectivity in terms of the location and the train system. The transportation system is well organized. So yeah, I mean, it was closer also to Munich as well, one of the biggest cities in Germany. So, it was 45 minutes remaining 15 minutes to Innsbrook. So, it was really good in terms of the location… to the Italy border, the Italian border was one and a half hour so it was in the central hub of Europe pretty much.\", '', '', '', 'Mi:\\tyes, my at my schoo…l I mean my time being in Austria was finished in May 2008. That was for one year. So, May 2008 I packed my luggage and I had to come back to Turkey. I had a Diploma ceremony for my undergrad so that was… I was busy with all summer regarding this and then also I planned ahead that I needed I needed to apply for certain programs in Canada and Australia as well. So, I decided mostly the Canada as I explained to you earlier and then application process started. And then, sorry, my application process started in my second term when I was in Austria. And then, I applied for. For the program, I got a approval from the program from graduate college International Business diploma program. So, then that was three, four months period that I applied for visa for Canada. I prepared my documentation. And as you can imagine all that preparation to go to a new country like your health insurance or travel insurance and all that. So, then it was 24th August in 2009, and I travelled to Canada, Dallas for educational purposes. ', '', '', '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, so let's know let's talk about your professional background. What's your\", '', 'professional background? ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tMy professional background, I studied international relations. So, some people think that it's a profession, but an academic field shouldn't be a profession. It's a, it's a different aspect. But in Turkey, the understanding of academics is totally different. They treat the academic programs as a college program, but that's why that's one of the missing parts, my personal opinion that in Turkey, there are some college programs existing but it's not that sufficient or it's not utilize it utilizing it in a good way. That's different topic but to answer your question, yes, I graduated from international relations program, which was in back home in Turkey. But during this summer times, I actually worked in, I wouldn't say work but internships mostly in some firms that was one of them was Hamza bus manufacturing company. I was in their Import Export department because the International Relations graduates in Turkey, they are mostly people, the understanding of this program, when you're working in the field, the field should be in the big companies for corporate environment in their Import/Export department. First of all, they are expecting the fact that your language level I mean, the foreign language, or let's say English, German or Italian, Spanish, whatever that the language that you have. So, they're assuming that you can manoeuvre that process more smoother compared to other administrators. So, we're basically administrator but more and more in a structured format because you have to know the export policy, import policy, and all that. So that was a dimension, but I just wanted to double it also the mandatory on the school that you needed to have that internship during that time frame. So other than that, I didn't have any work experience. So, when I came to Canada, that was my first work experience and that was abroad. So that was the interesting part.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOh, and what was the first work experience? ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tFirst work experience I, I mentioned to you earlier that I didn't have a chance to work that much at the regular college, during my studies. So that was a point that because of the financial difficulties, I had to find a job and I was working at the Indian restaurant. Yes, it was mostly serving position. And my school was typically ending at 4pm - Everyday Monday to Friday.. it's full time college program. So, as you can imagine, it's not like undergrad or something. So, 4-6, I had two hours difference and I was evaluating this time mostly either feeding myself or reading some materials and then going to the restaurant my shift was starting 6. It was ending at 2am. So that was four hours. But not every day though. I would say the hours were between 20 to 25 hours. And sometimes this restaurant was catering to the to the weddings. So, first time, I had a chance to see some Indian weddings, some Pakistani weddings, so that was fun. That was my first, but it wasn't full time. It was part time. And as you can imagine, as a student, the best way to find employment is hospitality - food and beverage. So, then the first full time experience was again hospitality. That was a Tim Hortons. But again, part of that was, so after my graduation, the process is in Canada, you have to apply for postgraduate work permit. I'm not sure they change that or not, I didn't have a chance to analyse the policy how it looks like but so I applied for this postgraduate work permit, but at that time, the ideal way of getting the Canadian permanent residency. So that was the provincial nomination program (PNP). Okay, so here's the thin line. So I wanted to get the Canadian work experience, but I heard from so many people that if you have just solo work permit, to find a job is really hard, or you can find some certain jobs, but that's not going to be as satisfactory because employers - their perspective is typically you have a work permit, there's a validity for it. So, how can we rely on your work for immigration and afterwards but if Canadian government or Immigration Canada wouldn't like you to continue with you in terms of the immigration process, so this kind of jeopardize situation for employers and also jeopardizing the employees as well. So that's why I was in between to apply the PR or not. So then I decided to move forward to be part of this PR  program, because I wanted to get the work experience here and my program itself after I joined the program, I realized that it's, there's a core program that I also joined core program, I forgot to mention, that was not paid. That was an internship as well. So, my goal again, I was still sticking with the same goal or You got your education in a different country, and you got the North American aspect. And then you can add an additional work experience to real life work experience, and then you can go back home. But again, during this time, it was so tough to find a job that compliments my, my fields like international business and international relations as well. Part of it is education. Credentials back home is not recognized by the employers. It's recognized if it's in English in Canada, that's why they accept you for the next step to be as an international student, as obvious. But - employers they typically rely on your Canadian experience either or the Canadian educational experience. So, and also consider the fact that we look at comparing two cities like Toronto or Vancouver, the job opportunities are really rare. Maybe if I would be in in Toronto or Vancouver, maybe chances would be better. But, again, I was in a position that maybe if I could get my permanent residency, then I will get the real Canadian work experience. So I was in Winnipeg. So that makes it more interesting. So during this time period, either like, okay, so you get your PR, and then you can get the ‘real’ job, but you get the PR, the PNP program. It's a bit complicated. I'm not sure if it makes sense yet. Yeah. So the permission moment of programming still continues right now, but I'm not sure how efficient it is. So, it requires that first of all, you get a job letter from a certain employer. That's not necessarily relevant. Doesn't have to be relevant to your background. But any kind of institution any kind of Corporation, Tim Hortons or Starbucks, or a catering company, any kind of field sector …needs to be full-time. So this job letter and and some other documents that you provide to provincial government and the provincial government may or may not they give you a certain credential that okay you're approved for the nominate program and the next step is to apply for the federal program which is the permanent residency.\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tNot Express entry, it’s the PNP. I'm not sure that it was existing at that moment. I don't want to mislead your research, but it's definitely it's definitely worth to take a look at it because we are talking about here 2011 that I applied. Sorry, that's correct. So 2011, it's worth to take a look, if there's express entry in Canada.. So during this time, I was working at Tim Hortons, but also, I was an entry level. So if I was a storefront, they name it. But also it was the suggestion of the employer that you were suggesting me if we will put you on a spot to be in the management. So, your approval from the federal would be more easier. Because you'll look like you're more skilled and it could correlate, or it could it would complement your international business diploma because you're somewhat doing the business management. Yes. So that made sense for me. And it put me in the management program, and I've worked there for entirely three years. And because the process takes took three years, and unfortunately, during this process, you're not, you don't have a chance to change your job. So that was the, that was the process. And even I got some job offers during this time, but, but I couldn't I couldn't change it.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tUm, in terms of moving to Canada, I know that you discussed it, but like, how long did you prepare for it? Like, how did you plan? How long did you plan and think about it? How much time like did you spend doing? ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tSo I think it was… it also overlaps the idea of ‘going abroad’ and moving to Canada. So specifically, just to answer your question about Canada, I would say six to eight months, but going and living abroad. I wasn't sure I will live entirely all my life. But just to have the taste of that. I think that was always on my mind. Since the elementary, because I always thought that the territories are something that we didn't create. So, I wouldn't I didn't want to limit myself in a certain boundary. I knew that there was always more to explore. Yeah, so that was just my way of understanding, as a word citizen or you can name it in a different way. But Yeah, that was this idea was always there but specifically for Canada I would say six to eight months, but it was mostly the mental preparation for - I mean just googling, doing some research about the climate first thing, and some other things the job opportunities, the culture itself, the education system and so on. Whatever you can imagine, I tried to do the research as much as possible and also the fact that I am as I mentioned to you earlier, the educational consultancy firm, there are also somewhat helpful in terms of mapping it out what would be the ideal Canadian experience - that they were not sufficient in sufficient in terms of how to you know how to prepare fully, because they were get imagination was or the their way of endorsing this imagination was mostly a ‘Canadian dream’. Even though that the process of getting your work permit process of getting a PR from the residency that was totally different than whatever they told me and whatever I experienced here because they were generalizing and putting in a different format for every single person, but they didn't mention about the difficulties or they didn't mention about the cons. So they were, they were mostly focusing on just the business part rather than this person is changing his entire life. They're not talking about the career, we're not talking about life here. So unfortunately, I would say a mental preparation was four to six months and between, I would say the next 2, 3 months it was mostly the documents and preparation, documents preparation, some bureaucratic preparation, but the mental preparation was, I would say four to six months, but the entire preparation process was six to eight months. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo move to Toronto?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tNo, that's another part that it's a complicated part. So, I decided to work in the marketing sector. So, I was really interested in the marketing inside the business spectrum, Business School spectrum. So, I decided to look for certain jobs but then I found a media integrated specialist position, which  was focusing on advertisement and marketing. It was an entry level position. And then I gave my previous knowledge to Tim Hortons. I was assistant manager at that time by the way. And they offered me being a store manager, but I certainly didn't want to move forward with hospitality because it was enough in terms of the difficulties and plus, I wanted to try more. I wanted to get a different insight, a different part of the business. And then I got this job at a different company - this is still in Winnipeg. I dis this job almost six months and then I was doing good in the company. But what happened was, there was a family emergency my mom had a stroke and she had the open-heart surgery. So, then I had to move back. And I had to give my notice of emergency. And they kept my job for a while. But after a certain period of time, of course, I totally understand the fact that they couldn't keep my position. And so that was a time that year.. 2015, February, I decided to move back to Turkey, not permanently, not definitely, maybe indefinitely. So, it was a big question mark. It was just an emergency purpose. And I didn't know, I didn't plan the rest. So that was the heartbreaking point in terms of not having the full taste of Canadian experience at that time. I didn't even know what was gonna be my future. Yeah, at that time. So then we've been 2015 February till 2016 October, I had my Turkish experience, I worked in two different jobs. One was the logistics coordinator in an international firm and the other one was, I was the procurement specialist. So I was mostly working in the agricultural company that they were important to exporting and they were actively participating in the tenders of United Nations and I was also working in the tender department as well. So, it was a well-paid job considering the fact that the standard of living in Turkey and some other factors, but after my mom's health was getting better, I offered my family to move entirely to Canada. I didn't want to limit their time being here because I offered them even six months in and out Not because of the policies or procedures, because I knew that, because of their age because of their cultural background, maybe they wouldn't be a good fit. Or maybe they wouldn't have a taste of Canada. Maybe they wouldn't like to be here. So that's why I suggested be with me six months or four months, whatever. And then you can go back to Turkey, we can maybe get a mortgage here or I can settle here because I definitely, I mean, doing this one and a half year in Turkey, I decided to move to Canada entirely, and I want to settle here. That was that, that tangible and concrete way of thinking that I would settle here. So that was a time, because of the economy, part of it, it's the polarized society. I didn’t want to live in a polarized society. I didn't want to live in a society that that people are judgmental about certain things, and I'm still not sure if running away or leaving the country is a good choice? As an individual, maybe it's a good choice. But if you're thinking more of a, because I love my country, I think that individuals can create certain environment that it would definitely impact your campaigns. But sticking with the subject, yes, that was a time that I decided to move back to Canada and because of the job opportunities, potential job opportunities, I wanted to come to Toronto so year 2016 October, I came to Toronto from Turkey this time \", '', '', '', \"So first I wanted to continue as a procurement executive because I wanted to see that there's any way of working in that field and plus my, even though I was working in a domestic company in Turkey, but our operational spectrum was International. So, I was hoping the fact that maybe I would get somehow, I would get some opportunity in my field as a procurement executive. But unfortunately, my application process was really heavy. Even when I was applying to certain job boards, like indeed… they were reviewing my resume, but they weren't responding. Because I know the fact that whoever I went to and ask, even the professional HR specialists, they were saying that yes, you have a rich background, we can definitely take advantage of it. But at the same time, you don't have a specific procurement executive experience in Canada. So that's the roadblock. And then I decided to change my way because I needed the financial funds. I started to work, which is entirely different field, as a construction worker. I worked in construction for six months. I needed just cash to get to the next level. And I was offered by my employer that would you like to be an installer and the money is really is really good. It's a lucrative business. You need to work with your hands but at the same time with pays off. I said, my goal driven, I'm a goal driven person, but not the money driven person. Money is a tool should stay as a tool. But there should be more than that so I said no. And meanwhile, I was looking for some job opportunities. And I took an opportunity of being an account executive in a software as a service SaaS company. So, we were building platforms like coding platforms, yeah, JavaScript and then some other programming languages that we were using. So, it was fun because I was dealing with the schools directly. I was managing the account and as well as I had the program coordinator that she was helping me out, how to coordinate after the sales process. And I learned a lot I learned the structure of not the post secondary or for the university level institutions, but high schools, primary schools and JK to 12. I had a chance to having an experience of the structure is, so it was it was eye-opening. And then I decided to work for, because I needed the money because my initial goal together to get my master's degree in something that, what I am pursuing right now, immigration, settlement, similar approaches, which would be ideally multidisciplinary. And in this case, I can take my international relations, political science background and I would enrich it with the different aspects such as sociology or anthropology, which as you know, it's not enriched in international relations program. There are some courses but the courses are mostly just intro to Sociology and intro to anthropology or so on. So that's why I needed some funds and I got a good offer from a financial institution that as a credit counsellor. So it was also helpful for you to understand what the society's is going through right now in terms of debt. Debt is one of the biggest thing and in Canada, I think the overall lean on the word worldwide, right? So I worked there for for two years, and I saved my money for my tuition and luckily, I got the scholarship as well and I put this money on the side. So, in this case that I don't I didn't need to hustle that much and work doing my studies. So right now, I'm not working. But if you're asking me in general what I graduated from, did it entirely compliment my experiences? I don't think so. Because of the circumstances because of the the job availability itself, and because of also the other the reason I think personally about I experienced is the need to make money, we need to survive. So that pushes you in certain fields that maybe you're not going to be engaging. Maybe you'll know that first place when you read the job description, but at the end of the day, you have to bring the food on the table. So that that was the main reason that why I kind of switched from one sector to another sector, but it was all complimenting the business, which I took my business management, administrative skills to jobs, and sales. I think sales is a different ballgame. It's you can either learn, and it's not something that you can entirely learn. You should have some sort of sales skills in you, but at the same time, you can enrich it. So, it was helpful, but at the same time, I've mostly enjoyed my role when I was not selling the educational coding platform, but I was actually giving some presenting my consultation, like counselling sessions to the people that who are in that. So, to see that how people are desperate, lack of educational background for lack of skills that there is a lack of financial literacy too, which is not getting taught in the primary school or high school. So, it was an eye opener. It was a it is a life experience rather than that work experience.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tYeah. So I mean, I think you've answered a lot of this question already. Okay, about about your skills or how do your skills fit in the skilled migration program.\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tSure, that's a good question. I think I have Okay, this is a I want to start from this story… When I was seven, eight years old. I saw footage on the TV. That that was. That was a topic that some anchor-man they were discussing about what's happening in Bosnia war. So, I was seeing a truck that it was saying UN - the United Nations. I didn't know what it stands for. So, I was asking my parents, they didn't speak English, of course, they didn't know. And they figured out that they probably bring some food. And that says Un in Turkish Un, it's a flower. Yeah. So they kind of correlated to that. I said Wow, that's nice. What are they doing? They said ‘Oh, they're helping people that were actually suffering from war. So then I started with dig deep about UNICEF. What they are doing, I didn't have any knowledge now reach like 10-11 years old. I told my parents that I want to work for UNICEF. I want to help children, I want to, I want to be part of the community that whoever is suffering from war from certain difficulties. I want to be helpful because if I'm not going to be helpful, what is the purpose of my entity in this world, my existence in this world, that's a different way. We can discuss later What is the purpose of being present in this world. That's a different topic, but I wanted this and funny enough, I chose international relations and then I was more involved in certain cases, theories, how it was helpful, or it wasn't helpful to interpret certain situations. And then I found myself in this job, In business kind of field, which I don't like because there's no human touch, in my opinion, I think. You can, you can actually covered it, or spice it up with a more humane touch. It is totally up to you. We don't need to, I don't need to put it as an excuse. But I think how I can bring my economic experience and my undergrad experience with the business. First of all, I have a, I have a theory I have the idea of major research paper. So, which I'm thinking about how the business class immigrants, they switch from business class to different streams. Either being an entrepreneur in the entrepreneurship program in Canada, or they go different streamlines because they don't have the channel that they can actually continue in that channel. And actually apply their, their experiences, right? So, I'm thinking about doing a research about their experiences, their difficulties, specific before that was, and also what are the challenges and how to overcome it. That was my idea. But once I'm getting into more and the program, I'm seeing and getting influenced by different kinds of ideas, ideas that are right now, so I might not stick with that idea in terms of my major research paper, but just to answer your question more clear. I think with my, with my business skills, I will I wouldn't just name it just administrative and also some marketing skills, but you can just put a bit from here and there and kind of make it a big, big impact on your future skills. But again, it's so limitable. It's not that why I mostly feeding myself from my international relations background and my interest in that field, even in the in the class discussions, I'm seeing myself more confident, not because of my business background, but because of my international relations background. So what I want to do with this field, unfortunately, I can put my business skills, mostly maybe into the presentations because I learned a lot in the program, or my, my dialogue skills or maybe administrative format, when I'm preparing or writing a paper because in the undergrad level, you have some short term limits that you can go beyond, but International Business program it gave me an understanding….I was involved in so many different marketing research projects. So that gave me an understanding of how to do research. How you can excel to a point that you can be successful in your future endeavours. So I think that could be helpful in that sense. But compared to my undergrad and business, post-secondary degree, the book will be helpful but in different ways, it's hard to tell how it's going to help me. It is more hybrid. That's, that's good way of explaining that. So, but in future, I would like to work in an NGO, or I would like to stay in academics, if that will be able to position, if there will be any sort of day. I know, it's really challenging, and it demands so much from an individual. I would love to do that either stay in academics or working for an NGO. In this case. I don't want to actually be in specifically Canadian settlements, sector. I don't want to just file the papers and just check the policies. I think that I, I can do more. The more is? It's a good question. It is it is really. I mean, I think certain things, for example, helping someone's paperwork in the settlement sector, or trying to figure out what's the what's missing policy in here, or what kind of policies we can implement in this case? That's totally valuable. I understand. But yeah, I'm not trying to degrade the value of it. I totally respect that. But at the same time, if I can stay in academics, I can try to see what are the missing parts in the policies\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo do you see any missing parts in policy now?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tNow … temporary foreign workers. Yeah, it's a big time. I mean, I was reading an article referring. She She has a Filipino background. And she was focusing on the temporary foreign worker program and how Filipino migrants actually suffered from it. She had a focus group and everything. So, first of all, it's good to start this four years in, and four years out policy. It was it was totally endorsing the fact that there's a Canadian dream, come here, work for four years, but at the same time, that the officials they were doing numerous trips, from Alberta, Saskatchewan from different provinces, Manitoba as well, that they didn't actually fully explain in the thesis. That's what it says. They didn't fully explain what the pros and cons are, they were mostly talking about pros like a salesperson. I mean, we need to explain that first. So four years in four years out policy is once you are accepted as temporary foreign worker. So, the policy was, I'm not sure if it still continues the same way. I think government, Immigration Canada was trying to do some adjustments or they were discussing about that, I'm not sure if it's an act right now or if it's a policy change on the table. But once you're in the four years, you allowed to work 4 years and after your for your duration is expire, then you have to leave the country. That's what the program says, but what actually this program led these workers because they created an environment here they created a belonging here. So they want to find a way to apply for for permanent residency. So, at that time PNP program was a good way of finding that channel. Mostly It started with the seasonal workers. So speaking of skilled classification, yeah. That definitely is related with this temporary foreign workers. So, they are typically mostly the temporary foreign workers, they were low skilled. And most of them, they wanted to stay in Canada. So, they either went for PNP, or they were looking for a sponsorship. But the sponsorship as you can imagine, directly from an employer, it was so rare. But mostly it was the PNP programs that they were finding a way to get their permanent residency.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo, sort of a Alright, so let's also talk about your family. So you losing your family and what was their role in your migration?\", '', \"Mi:\\tSure. So my parents are still alive and Scott, and I have an older sister. So she is 16 years older than me. So I'm 33 years old now. So she's almost 50 I guess, 48. She had no influence or no endorsement in my immigration, migration process. But mostly, my father was a pro. My mom was against.. She was looking at the things more in a sentimental way. And I totally feel for her. And it is a tough decision to leave the country, to leave your family. But my father, he was looking at things more pragmatic way, because he saw that in me that this is what I wanted to be and I would be unhappy to live in the country, live in Turkey. Because of so many reasons, as I explained to you the polarized way of society and the economic situation, yes, I would probably. I'm just imagining myself what would happen if I wouldnt come to Canada Do you think that would be a good way of explaining? I will probably get married in my early 20s. And I would have children right now because of the societal pressure, time pressure, family pressure? It is still there. When we are skyping, they still endorsing the idea of like, when are you getting a married? When are we going to have the children on our hands?, and I'm just saying that I have goals once I finish these goals, and then when they accomplished then my first of all, is not going to just get married -  to find the right person. Marriage is just a paper. The system certificate, interestingly a certificate so accomplishing something of some sort. They do they certify you. So I just don't understand this notion. I never understood. So they are more conservative in terms of the traditional way of living, or being an individual. But I'm not entirely thinking the opposite, though. But most of the things that we don't agree, but I think, in family if you find the right way of putting the dialogue, I think they're going to understand you don't need to fight they don't need to. You need to just empathise yourself. Empathy is the key. So then that works. They don't understand me sometimes. I didn't understand them, but I'm trying and then they started to try my position. So, once I'm explaining what I'm going through and what I went through as I explained everything all the immigration process. Now they value it, and they justify it, my situation that why I'm not rushing, or quitting a job. Yeah. But yes, mostly father was abroad during this immigration process. Mom was against and and the sister was neutral.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAlright, so we can now I think move to the mapping. So, in your case, I think I want to I want to know about all of the visas that you went on in your study abroad, work abroad. experiences. So mostly, that would be for Austria and Canada. ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tCan I map it out in terms of the emotions as well?  Can I draw two tables which was Austria and Canada? Okay, let's put this…So the first one I'm putting as figure one, which is going to be the Austria visa process because there was only one visa, so there's no need to explain other which is simple. Figure two is going to be a little bit complicated. I would like to start with Austrian one because the experience was. So, I think in every single, I mean mostly the westernized countries, their requirements are so detailed. So, I would say this is I would say, stress level. The most two things that I would name is during these visa processes, one is the stress level in terms of emotion. And one is that the work that you put, so I would say the efforts/time. It's gonna go the same way I guess okay so the stress level was not too much because it was educational purpose. I knew that it was going to end really, really soon but the effort and time, European Schengen visa is really demanding, but the stress level Let's just say one to 10 – I would put 4. Stress 4, effort 9. So again 1-10. I would just kinda put here in detail - Study permit. Okay in this case let's put it this way. So Schengen visa process, let's say study permit. So study permit was again one to 10 I would say, because, okay, this is kind of different. The stress level was a little bit less again. I would put 2. OK, because, so the paperwork process for Austria was handled by myself, but the paperwork process in Canada, was handled by that consultancy agency. So, and they're actually they helped me out a lot with that, of course I paid to him. So that's why I knew that they guaranteed the approval is going to be there, you're I mean, you're eligible for so many things, so everything will be fine. So that's why the stress level was not that much, and effort was not that much. So, I would put 4 and 2. Just gathering the documents was a bit tough. \", '', '', '', \"But the PR and immigration is different. So I'm going to draw two figures. One is gonna be the provincial Nominee Program. The other one will be PR process and the last one will be the citizenship application so there will be three graphs. sorry I just couldn't organize on my mind. So this figure, figure 2a, figure 2b, and figure 2c. I mean, it might not be the right category, but I'm just trying to kind of sub categorize. Okay, so let's start with the figure a. which will be the regular work permit/pep. So, again, one to 10 scale. This was stressful. This was this was I would say 8 because the program wasn't explained enough. Even though there were some provincial, like Manitoba start up. Yeah. I'm not sure if you heard of them. They're actually a non-profit organization funded by government. They're explaining. They're providing some sort of consultancy to the people that who are going through this process. So the people over there, the agents over there, they were so helpful. It was good. I mean, I have to justify this of course… but but in general still there were so many unknowns. So, I would say the stress level for the PNP program because it's just the first step, but you don't know what's going to happen afterwards. And the effort and time, I think this will kind of never change because effort and time exceptt this part. This part I'm gonna explain to you the citizenship part, it will always be the same. I would say let's say 9. So this was because there was more document requirements and job another, job offer letter from the employer and explaining this process to the employer. They were even though they were familiar, they were a bit hesitant about certain things, and you had to be nice with them. So other part is you need some documents from Turkey, the official documents and you cannot be scanned. So, you need origin documents. And plus, you need to provide certain documents in different categories. So that was a bunch of different combinations. So, effort and time, and yeah, it was 9. So, the second one, I mean, as a lot of subcategories. I can talk about the PR, which is not the main goal, but the main goal is this, but this is the segue as you know. So we're going to use a different color. So, one to 10 scale again. Yeah, stress level we categorize we don't change the category. I had some some documents already get prepped before, you you would use some documents that are already in the database in this process. You don't need to get everything from scratch but at the same time, the form itself, the application form itself is so detailed compared to the PNP program, or the work permit. So I would say, effort and time goes hand in hand. But in terms of not to gather the documents that much, but to be more cautious about how to fill out the form. Again, I needed some sort of support and I got that support from Manitoba start-up program. Okay. That was helpful in terms of their guidance. They didn't feel the forum behalf of me, but they gave me certain guidance. So I would say interesting way, maybe seven, for for the effort of time, but the stress level was, was more I would say… I don't want to say 10 because it's not a life and death situation. I always knew that I had another option. Worst case scenario, I would go back home. I would find different ways. Different ways mean… just want to open that. People think about different ways as shortcut fails, like getting married with someone or different kinds of opportunities. But I had that opportunity in my previous relationship that she offered me straight – you dont need to go through this process. I refuse. I refuse it because I don't want to rely on someone's bill to you know, I don't want to jeopardize the situation. What if you wouldn't get along at certain periods?\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tHow long will you meet with this person?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tShe offered like I was overall three and a half years, almost four years. But she offered me in the middle of this time frame. I mean, two years. When we were two years together, she offered me she said, You don't need to go through this process. You can just handle everything more smoothly. But I refuse. I refuse that. Again, this is this is really complicated because if you really don't feel that this is the right thing, because some people, they just rely on this, and I didn't want to do that. It wasn't voluntarily some people just, you know, offer some sort of money or internal arrangement. They call it fake marriage, but it wasn't fake. It was real that at the end proves that we are not together anymore. So, I was right. I was right. Okay, so seven, stress level was nine. And the last one will be the citizenship. Yes, I already applied for my citizenship. I pass the knowledge test, I'm just expecting the oath, the ceremony. So, the time that I pass the knowledge test, it was 29 April this year. So, they literally talked to me about the timeframe between six to six months, six months to One year. So, we will see how that goes. It's already five months past, I have no rush. I think the stress level is really low because after this process, it lowers. Its smooth. So, I would say to and the effort again, I got, I was busy at that time, and I got some help from an immigration agency that they prepare those documents. So, I would say after that time, maybe 4, so two and four.\", '', '', '', \"I guess I already passed the certain stages. And according to my immigration consultant, she said that if you pass the knowledge test, and if you provided certain documents and all about, it's all about just waiting for them to call you for the oath, and the ceremony, and then you will be officially getting the certificate of citizenship, so it's not 100% because it's not official, but it's on the way.\", '', '', '', \"I lived in Turkey for one and a half years, the certain requirement is, as you might know, after you get your PR For the next five years, you have to be present in the country for at least three years. So, I had to fulfil my gap for the application process to be eligible for citizenship application. So that's the gap. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAll right. Now we're gonna move on to the next question. So commercial services. So in all of these processes, what are the commercial services that you used? You know, things that you paid for.\", '', \"Mi:\\tSo commercial services - so only two of them so the one for Austrian visa - I paid for it, the Schengen visa/ study permit - that all is the same. I paid yeah the agent. Yeah, yeah. So that was paid to a consultancy agent - that they had the firm. The second one was I mostly use it, as shared with you, that was the not for profit, it was funded by government. So I never got into any IELTS or TOEFL process because first of all my back home with the education was 70% English so let's put it this way - so during my application to the college they recognize that I don't need to provide any IELTS in Canada. So I never got any IELTS or any TOEFL. I found the way. So other than that when it came to applying for citizenship they they were asking basically the requirement is but also what complimented my post secondary, that the regular college, because if you have the post-secondary diploma It shows the certain benchmark, and you're not going to get the test English test required.\", '', '', '', \"So visa fees, I paid it by myself for the Canadian citizenship one. But for the Austrian one, it was help from the parents. So yes, it was paid by the people that I have the relationship with. All the fees of course and I paid for it. So the Austrian one was paid for by my family. It was supported by my family but the rest it was paid by my own financial funds. I covered everything. So yes, I’m going to include that one too. The insurance for sure. So, other than that, as you mentioned the translation services - that was a big thing that I paid for. So, I pretty much paid except the citizenship one, I pretty much paid for all those documents the entire process each time. Okay, let's let's be clear. I'm just trying to refresh my memory so not each time. So, only one time for the for the translation services because I had already got documents that I translated. and not for the police clearance because you need to always renew it has to be updated version as you might know. But the rest like let's say, the translation of diploma or certain things. I had it only once and I kept the record of it as a scan version because I knew that the application process was going to be held online. So that's why it was easier. I didn't have to pay each time. But it is kind of complicated because I set the police clearance and the police clearance from Turkey. You don't pay for it. It's a free service. Like everybody has a right to get that documents without any problem. But just because it needs to be updated. So, you have to literally translate it and get that done all the time. So that's why it was the most challenging part. It was all in Turkey. Diploma, criminal record check, what else? - birth certificate, and of course ID, and pretty much it. So for Austria I would say all. For, Canadian citizenship, just because I had already diploma, translation as well as birth certificate and Id, already so I only needed the police certificate. So for the first work permit – it was pretty much everything. By the way, if it might be more that I'm gonna go home and just check it out. I can add more. PR process – so I think, of course CR (criminal record), I already had preparation for from my previous work premise application so that complemented most of it. So, the health insurance for Canadian citizenship, there's no health insurance needed. Work permit – its hard to think. We forgot the study permit – of course this was a consultancy as well, which is the most important. So study permit. I think I have the tendency to forget that maybe that time. Let's put a note here that I said this one okay, let's put it this way all of the translation services were provided by Turkish origin services or companies. \", '', \"Insurance was a Canadian company called CR something. Document translation was provided by Turkish councillor. Why don't the reason that why I need the Turkish origin any documents from originally from Turkey, that translation Part too because since I was living in Winnipeg, they don’t have a consulate there. The consulate is in Toronto so I took advantage of that in my citizenship application. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tTell me about the role of technology in your migration. ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tHeavily heavily… and I know mom praise Steve Jobs,Bill Gates a lot… because the communication tools are there. But apart from that I actually use technology for my research or to seek certain things even in the city - what kind of gigs what kind of events, even during my time being in Canada too so yes. So maybe you can categorize it and…Connection is one thing. You use technology, mostly, heavily right? So, communication. So, this graph is going to be the first one and use of technology category. So, the first one we will do is the communication. So in communication is I would say mostly I was communicating with, of course, friends and family. So I don't have that much connectivity with their relatives so I would just use categorize them. So, one to 10 scale - So mostly friends were four or five. Lets say four. And family was nine.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what kind of media were you using?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tIt was mostly at that time Skype. Skype is the tool. Yeah, we're not talking about right now we're talking about the most used one is Skype, okay? Because there was no tools whatsapp, viber, no smartphones. Smartphones were there, but this is the beginning, he parents were not able to utilize. This we will call research again specifically for gigs, some events, conferences, which is rare and but it happens if it interests me and then… so research. So, I would say let's categorize this on to So, okay. One is as the Google using as a tool and one is the email endorsement. So it's about, let's say platforms. So, which means sometimes there were some common platforms that people were sharing ideas, gigs and all that. And you already subscribed into it, and then you automatically get email subscriptions, and some weekly newsletters. And one is like, just randomly searching. what's what's going on in the city. So, I would say equal measures. I would say 6 and 6. And the reason that I'm saying Six not because of it doesn't represent the interest level of using the technology but also represents that this may be the rest of 4 that we didn't include, it was endorsed by friends or word of mouth. So, I didn't need to use technology haven't had that much because Winnipeg is a small town. I started to use technology more when I was in Toronto. So word of mouth, it really works in terms of like, how you accommodate yourself in the Winnipeg lifestyle. Because mostly the school platform, I don’t remember the name exactly, but it was school graduates or alumni. \", '', \"I think we should include that one as well, to migration purpose. It was mostly the government website. Again, this is the one that you can rely on. Yeah. And also just because I was using the PNP program, they had their own website and plus Manitoba start-up. They’re helping after you know during your time being there like in terms of resume building, job seeking. Typically they tried to help you out of the jobs of how you can integrate after your residency and after your integration process. Settlement support. So they had their own website, they were also sharing some events in terms of job seeking, or there's a job fair that you guys should come over and for. There's a conference, information session about some policy changes. I was happy with their service. I saw definitely a compliment.\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tBefore I forget, I would like to jump to my experience for coming from Turkey to Toronto. When I left Turkey and when I came in 2016 until now, that's what you're wondering know. Okay, so let's put it this way then. So 2016-present - it was the citizenship process so I already had PR. So let's say PR attained in 2013. So, and then two years, I held a PR in Winnipeg. And then in the present, Toronto. 2015 Apr-2016 Oct I was in Turkey. I can just name it as the transition period from Winnipeg – Turkey – Toronto. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAny significant things from social connections to like friends, family community professional network. I mean, you mentioned the Manitoba startup program, but anything else that you want to any significant relationships that you want to add on your map? And I'm also referring to intimate relationships. \", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI can recall that so you read my mind. So, my my ex partner, she was really helpful mentally. And she was born and raised in Canada, but she put so much effort in to understand what I'm going through. She was always there when I had those stressful times. She was trying to give me that comfort zone by activities, by trying to help me to engage with the environment because I guess this emotional connectivity she wanted me to stay there. So, she didn't want me to leave. That's why I've actually made community like, she didn't want me to leave. And also that's why she wanted me to. She offered that getting Let's get married. And let's go through the citizenship process more, more smooth. But because I had the the military service obligation at that time, back in Turkey - I didn't obey that, by the way. So, we didn't need to, we don't need to add it into the map. So I paid 6000 American dollar at that time, and just to waive it. So, in this case, I would be exempt from military service. So that was one question on my mind and plus Winnipeg itself. If I would like to have a Canadian experience, I didn't want to settle in Winnipeg specifically for my entire life. But at that time, she was showing the signals that…the family was there part of her family. And have she had a secure job. And she wanted to. She wanted me to stay. And she was thinking that Winnipeg would be the place to settle. But I wasn't agreeing on that term. And but regardless, she was really helpful I could her. I would name my father that - he was so supportive. And also, I would mean a close friend that became to Canada together. He was… just because he was in the process. He was so helpful, when the times that I was hesitant about if I would actually put my energy to stay in this country, or I would maybe go back. So, he was kinda lifting me up. So that was so helpful. So would name three people and I guess you're asking it to map it out there. Let's use a different model. I would but with all due respect to my father, he was not there with me physically. So physical connectivity is important, I would put first. I can name her. Well there you go. Ex-partner. The second person would be my father even though he was not there physically but mentally he was day to day, sending messages asking me how am I doing it?, if I need something. So he was there. He was there. And, I can name it as best friend. He moved to Saskatchewan. He's actually he wants to bring his, his brother for his master's. So I think I can name some people in terms of personalities, but also Manitoba start-up. There were two agents there. They were so helpful. They were so caring. They were easily empathising with your situation. And I think their psychology background is so strong that personally I'm not sure. That's what my observation is because they will easily empathise, they weren't looking at you as a case or as a client or just a, just a person. They really can do that. You are a person that trying to find a way to robust your situation here without suffering. So, they were definitely helpful. Yeah, they were so explanatory in terms of the process in terms of even the single boxes in the form that… what to write, what not to write, the due dates, they were so cautious before. So hopefully they are in a good position or not even maybe in the same organization. So 2 agents, I would say.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo if if that's done, then we can move on to the next. So let me let me just ask you about the most challenging aspects of your migration journey throughout. So pretty much everything that you've written so far. Okay, let's circle the most challenging or the biggest obstacles that you faced or mark them however you like.\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tSo, of course the work permit and PNP part. This is the first one.  I'm mixing the colors because just to be just a little more visible. This is the second. This is third. This is 4th. This is for because that's the last stage. I had not much doubt about certain things and I wouldn't want to include Austria because that was a different kind of category. So, for this one [work permit] the most challenging one was uncertainty, the Psychological part, whether you will get it or not. So heres the same [PR], I would say, the psychological factor whether you'll be able to obtain this is the PR or your status or not. So, the PNP and as well as the PR process, it is so connected, interconnected. So, it is hard to, to differentiate from one to each other in terms of psychological. You still feel the stress level. Here just basically you’re in a situation that is your fingers are crossed and you’re just waiting. Can I just make a correction? T his is 2011.  So, the process was, I mean, the PR process was not that long, because each province has different responses. If you're in Ontario, at that time, the process took longer. But in promises like my intro by Saskatchewan, I think the number of applicants, one of the main reasons, is more low compared to the Ontario or bigger provinces as BC. But I think it took two years, two and a half years after I applied for PR. I was on work permit and I had to work in the same employer, even though I got some opportunity to explain that to you. So that was the painful part. In daily basis, let's say you have the moments that you really don't think that this job is not a good fit for you and you have an alternative, but you cant evaluate that alternative because of your complicated situation, status situation. So that was really difficult. And this one was just that just the duration because I think lately what I heard the processing times are getting longer and longer. Yeah, even the Canadian citizenship. So I would just say I think that the duration of the process. This one is more more psychological rather than psychological. It's more….it is kind of psychological but it is more of a, because the cultural fit is gonna to be there or not?. So I would say unknown or uncertainty. Sure, cultural connectivity? I don't know if I just put it in the right way, but yes, there's the uncertainty of cultural connectivity. So, Which means will you have a culture shock? Or Is it the right decision? What is expected of me? What kind of difficulties I will face? It is kind of routing to cultural connectivity still. Let's say it my first year in Canada. So that's going to give you an idea. Yeah. So, I'm gonna put it in the behind, okay. First one year. So, again, we're going to rely on our fancy graphs. This is let's say, time. For the sake of me just try to figure it out because I need time and satisfaction? slash engagement. So, of course the first six months, there's a rapid increase because everything is new, you wanna explore everything. You're not getting homesick. From zero all the way up. Even though I was new, the climate was challenging, but everything was new and I'm a person - If I fail or if I just don't let certain things. I'm not a person that I used to blame myself about my choices, but I don't do that anymore. Because you never know without trying. But after six months there’s a dip. You start to feel homesick, criticism on certain things which is comparing traditions. I put criticism here because it might be sometimes rough, especially in my age at that time, It was hard for me - rather than accepting I was criticizing, And it turned to a comparison. Like why! I was criticizing mostly the lifestyle because in Turkey our lifestyle is more laid back. Not into this is a modern capitalist way of melting our lives in. For example, first time in my life I saw a drive through. I had never seen a drive through. Just sit down - you enjoy your meal you have a nice conversation you take you take your time and you actually give the value to the food. Again this is just the the comparison, the personal comparison for the food – the food itself, and the food culture and how do you value the food. And the advantage part of Toronto, which I didn't have the advantage that much in Winnipeg, like, there are tons of different restaurants that represents different cultures, different cuisines. And then questioning, pros and cons of staying. And then it stopped. The reason that it stopped and it's a more stable line, because first of all, you're making a decision. This time, and also it doesn't the decision that you make it is not helping you to increase the satisfaction level but at the same time you're accepting the situation. It's more like an acceptance rather than making plans. So the program itself that the PNP or other programs, it's not a satisfactory and you know the pros and cons pretty much by reading it, by hearing from other people's experiences, how it takes such a long time to invitation and all that. But by accepting the fact that if you really want to stay, and this is the route, take it or leave it. So that's why you somewhat, your plans are becoming more concrete but at the same time, it is helping you to go up or down, it is more like stable. So I think the first year is really important. That's why I just wanted to evaluate this year. And plus, it's easy to remember. That's why I don't want to go further about  second, third etc.. But I think this will be helpful to understand my first year experience.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tI suppose the final set of things that I want to ask you about generally broadly and maybe part of your mouth This is just questions. Have you provided migration advice to anybody? migration? What advice do you provide migration advice to people if they ask you? ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI do. I do. I had, especially after 2015 coup attempts in Turkey. Turkey is highly polarized. And the young professionals I mean, young professional friends, that which they have skills. I wouldn't want to name it low skilled\\\\high skilled school because that's the comparison what Canada does but I would say skilled. I value all the workers in a different sense. As you can imagine, that's I just done different kinds of jobs within sectors. There's no low skills or high skills. They are just skills. You just have the skills and you can reflect it to certain things. So, my friends were asking about what are the pros and cons of the immigration to Canada? So, my answer was, I kind of wanted to get away from giving a solid answer. I don't want to mislead people. But one thing that I was just sure making them understand the situation and then the process. I said the first thing, it's not easy. It will never be easy in the in the short run, and hopefully things will change in the long run, but and I said, Okay, depending on their age, I was asking them you need to sacrifice certain things and these things are family, these things are the job that you might not integrate your skills very well. And you have to maybe work, you might have to work in different kind of sector, different kind of jobs. And you might have to get used to a different culture, the food itself, not just the food, even the communication level of people. And something that you get used to that back home that maybe it's intimate, maybe that will be offensive to different business. So, you might have to get yourself into certain situations that, it's a huge sacrifice. And you only live once. If you're looking from this perspective, is that worth it? I mean, you have to just ask yourself this question, instead of asking me that, is that worth it? So these are the things these are the tools that I'm giving it to you. If you're asking details, I can provide you the details and I can give you the certain links that you can use search for your research. But yeah, I rather just reflect the question back. These are the things that you should expect if you come here, give or take. So, are you ready? Are you ready to sacrifice?. And then their enthusiasm level is going down and they're like, okay, I better maybe dig deep and take a look at it. And I'll get back to you if I need some sort of advice from you. And they typically don't get back to me. I'm not sure if I do the right thing or wrong thing, but I just want people to understand that this is not something like you’re ready for a backpacking trip. And you should understand that once they come here, they come here with certain burdens, financial burden on their shoulder, maybe they sell their car, their house, it's a big change. So, who am I to actually tell people that, yeah, you should come to Canada, you're going to be wealthy or rich, Canada is waiting for you. No, they need to be aware. So that's why I'm being so cautious when I'm giving them direction. I wouldn't call it giving them direction, I would call them just putting everything on one basket and making sure that the knowledge basket is full and they're picking the one that they need. So, I don't want to give the wrong direction. Because there's no wrong or right direction. It's everybody's own direction. So that's why I'm being really careful. But answering your question. Yes, time to time and they're asking me those questions. For education, it's a different aspect. I definitely endorse the education. I'm just telling them, look either for or learning a new language or if you want to get the post-secondary. If you want to get the post graduate experience, it's worth it. It's worth it. Because of these these reasons, yeah. But if you're just purely about to come to Canada, just for immigrating or settling, it's not easy. It's a long process. So, take the baby steps and think about it. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tokay, and what are your next steps?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tOne thing that I really like to do is when you are so connected with the work environment in Canada and you just have some other priorities to settle and earn, you let go of certain things like traveling, or participating in certain things because it all comes with the certain financial requirements, right?. So, first of all I want to value give the value to it. I want to enjoy what's actually in Canada. That's one part and… but before that I want to finish my, my school. I want to get my degree and I would like to concentrate on how I can fit myself into either academic environment. Or, as I told you working in a meaningful NGO that I can actually put my skills, learn more, gain more, give more. So that's my goal. Specifically, for Canada. Yes, I would like to live in this country. This country is great. I mean, but the experiences are great because we cannot blame either people or culture or physical things. The system has so many missing points. We all agree with it and officials agree with it especially after post 911 they increase securitization and migration regimes, border regimes and everything. It got to a point that stereotyping is so easy, visualization so easy. Unfortunately, as we talked before, taking part in, in in certain environments is not that easy, because there are certain barriers, especially workplaces diversity wise. Yes, yet, compared to other countries Canada is well diverse, but we have to actually fulfil this diversity as we talked before, so that's why I just really want to want to be …want to access certain things that I can fulfil my desires. At the same time I would like to have a good network in here that, which I've already started and I'm building that out which is good to take it to the next level but I cant just commit myself either living in Canada entire my life for going back to Turkey. I cant commit to this because you never know. You never know but I certainly think that there are so many opportunities here that I can take. And in the short run, and between the short and long run, I will definitely see myself I see myself to leave here and take advantage of everything but this is life as as my time being the gap between 2015 and 16. Sometimes things happen and life taught me that. Even though your desire is to be here, sometimes the circumstances put you in that spot. But in normal circumstances, yes, this country can give so much and I can also give so much that this country has got. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tBut what about life goals as well? Like do you want to get married or buy a house?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI think buying a house doesn't make sense, especially this in this. Yes, in this market prices. It doesn't make sense but of course in the future. But again, to to give to sacrifice so much from your life, to make a property meaningful, I think it doesn't make sense to me. I mean, the condition that the mortgage is important. I see some people that they are working for the mortgage for their entire life, but you only be once. How does that make sense? Instead maybe depending on the circumstances maybe buying your land and building my own house that's more meaningful. But again, it depends. So, of course, I would like to get married, again that the marriage meeting that doesn't mean a certificate. Just to get connected with someone forever, because I know some people that they are actually married in paper, but they're not connected. So, living separate lives. I don't want that type of relationship. So, it shouldn't be based on satisfying sexual needs. It should be based on connectivity, chemistry, and you should have your own space at the same time, which means we need to respect each other's space and also share and build something together.\", '', '', '', \"Toronto is not a good place for romance. We can meet so many new people, so many girls. But I think the connectivity is missing? Everybody's excuses is I'm busy. That's one thing.

So that's why it's easy to meet new people, but it's not easy to provide the sustainability.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how do you meet people?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI used to meet people that were that was at the birthday parties or events. Also, like occasional because I'm really open to talk every single person, it doesn't mean that. You know, you're asking for a date or something. But yeah, definitely, just uh, I don't think that the using the online tool Is this helpful. I tried five years ago, but it wasn't working, the online dating. It's so shallow and because you already… I'm not sure how to… I'm sure there's a sociological pathway behind it. But first of all, you're judging them by physical attributes. That's how you say yes. I think so not so many people reading the profile descriptions of that specific person. And when you meet there's a certain shy border and there's no uniqueness. Because everything is all structured. I think there was a documentary in Netflix about this, this topic. It was actually I'm just trying to remember the name of it. Black Mirror. There was an episode that. So that's a good one. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAlright, cool. So now the final question final. I'm looking at your map. What do you feel?\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tThe first feeling? It was it was tiring [laughs]. It was tiring, but I'm proud of myself In that sense that, Okay, I'm not, I'm proud of myself not to accomplish a citizenship process. I’m proud of myself that I gave myself a timeline to reach my goal. My initial goal was to get my Masters in the first place before I came here, because a lot I would make it may be shorter, but maybe it was meant to be this way. I believe in certain holistic things. And so I'm proud of myself that I thought about failing, I mean, if I was failing or not, or I thought about if I should change my path or anything, but I'm happy where I am right now. That's why I'm proud of myself. That maybe I had to go through all this. It made me stronger. Was that worth it? I think it's worth it in a sense that I am able to open the door to reach my ultimate goal regarding my educational view, right. But at the same time, it has taken certain things from me. The couple things that I want to mention, first thing that the family connection as much as I'm connected with, with my family using the communication tools, the technology and all that. But still, I didn't have a chance to witness, they're getting older, that process. I wanted to be with them. But at the same time some part says that this is life and we need to find your own path. Other thing is what I noticed, I think it's by this age and also what you read through to me, I was giving more meaning to the friendships to relationships, but it got diminished. I think during this process, I also seen some personal disappointments too when I was relying on certain people and certain friendships and relationships. That and then that's why also I just certainly focused on education. And to proceed in that field. So yeah, I think some part is missing, definitely I'm not the same person in the first time, when I first moved to Austria. Of course, age plays a role and the enthusiasm in certain things is different. I put more logic into things rather than intuition. It kind of makes me happy because the failure stage is not there. I know that how not to fail certain things which is which kind of makes me kind of happy. But at the same time, what makes us human also… that intuition that's, that's humane touch. But in Toronto, referring to your previous question about dating, or meeting new people. It's meeting people is not a problem, but having that meaningful conversation, It's a problem. I'm not trying to put myself in superior situation or degrade them or finding that put a scale or something. No. But maybe they are in the same situation maybe my, my way of talking to them, my interest levels are not appealing to them, its compatibility. Do you believe that putting up excuses, or is it just an excuse for people to have priorities? If you're really stressed with work, and if you're going to meet people right after your stressful shift, that's not going to be a worthwhile time.M:\\tIt is recording. Let's get started. So when did you first migrate to Canada? \", '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tIn 2018 February. And this is a permanent residency visa. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat were the motivations behind your migration here? Like what were the main factors you considered in making this decision? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tI think the main attraction was that they were giving a permanent residency like I was a US on work visa. To get a green in US for Indian National…according to some timelines, it's gonna take like 150 years. Yeah. So I can explain you why is that but that was the main reason. I would have never got a green card in US. So Canada was giving permanent residency easily so that’s the reason I moved here. So they have a country wide quota. They give green card from a pool of 7% of  the population from a particular country. So because India has a huge population, their dates are like...So, they are still giving green cards to people who applied in 2008-2009 from India, but for other countries like Pakistan, Nepal ,and Sri Lanka, they get it in one to two years. So that’s the flawed system that they have, especially Indian, Chinese and Filipinos are the most affected because of the number of people applying. So they have a cap of 7%.. So 7% of the green cards – they will give to a particular country. So that’s where the challenge is. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo how I mean…What's the difference between US and Canada? I mean, do you feel the difference?\", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tSo there is a difference. In the US, the salaries are much higher, much higher than Canada. It's like less expensive there because of the city that we were living in but generally the taxes are less. So I would say the health care expensive there. But otherwise everything is cheaper compared to Canada. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhere in the US where you?', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tI lived in multiple cities so I studied at Buffalo. Then I lived in Texas for some time. I lived in Indiana, Indianapolis thats like closer to Chicago. Those are the major cities I lived in. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOh, amazing. Well, how long were you in the US for?', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tSo I went there in 2013. So from 2013 – 2018 I lived there. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tProfessional background? what type of work do you do?', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tSo I’m into software consulting. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd are you currently working within your professional fields as well? ', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tYes', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how long I mean did you plan on consider your migration prior to move to Canada?', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tSo I would say, like, six months. That’s what it took me for moving to Canada, like I had to do the IELTS exam, then create my express entry profile and submit all the documents. Once I had my profile, it took me 2 and a half months for the final approval. And then I got my PR cards. Then I moved here in Feb 2018 so for the initial six months I was still going to the US for work, like I’d go on Monday and come back on Thursday. Yeah so I was still doing that for like six months but from October last year, I got a full time job in Toronto so im based here. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tRight. And like couldn't I mean, was there other pathways for you apart from getting the green card? I mean, like, could you just continue working?\", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tYeah, I could have continued working there on work visa but there are a lot of restrictions on the work visa. Like, when you're switching from one company to another company, you need to redo the process again. They are increasing their timelines for giving you approval for your work visa. And then like, if your visa is expired, your driving license expires as well so there are a lot of implications that comes when your expires. And then my wife, she did Masters in US as well. Unfortunately her visa was not fit for H1B so she had to quit her job. So she was on a student visa and she was working on her student visa. But she was not from stem background. So she gets only like one attempt at H1B and her visa was not in the lottery. So they have like, I think they allocate 5000 visas, and they’re like 250k people that apply for them, Right? So like one out of to get like 40% john 30% chance that will be picked in the lottery. So it's not skill based. It's actually lottery based. Yeah its luck based. So she did her Masters. But she couldn’t get a work visa. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tBut she could still be on your visa, though. ', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tYeah like she could still be in the US but she could not work. And so that was the main driving factor because I had work visa till like 2022, so I could have stayed and kept living. I had a good job, reasonable, well paying job but then we decided to move to Canada just to feel more stable and secure in our head…And of course, my wife… and she landed a job as a we got here as well. She’s an architect. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd in terms of your family's is just you and your wife and your, \", '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tSo we just had a kid. So yeah my Mom  cameand then my brother, he lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. He did the same thing. He did his masters and now he started working there and I have a younger sister as well. She lives in Delhi. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo what was the sort of family's broader role in your migration like even getting out of India for the first time for example, like were they very supportive of it what it was? \", '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tYeah. They were supportive. So I went out from India for work. So ofcourse, they were not paying anything and I was getting paid to move.  But then when I had to move to US, I had to take student loan.  But because I had worked in Singapore for some time, I had saved up some money for my education.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo was that always the plan that you go to work in Singapore and then study further in the US? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tNo that was not the plan. I was planning to work in India and then study in India and do my MBA in India. But then I got an opportunity to work in Singapore. So I moved there and after moving there, I realized I cannot stay here for long. Like it’s a place where you can stay for one or two years not longer than that. It’s a very small country. There are very limited job opportunities there. Salary wise, It's like, not too much and the work culture as well, Its like, I felt I cannot stay there for long...like I don’t have a long term instinct for staying here.. So what next, so that’s where the US came in. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tNow in terms of here in Canada, do you have any friends family or community here?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tSo I have mu childhood friends who moved from India to Canada. So I have few of those and then I have some distant family, and my wife has her friend circle. So, they helped us in settling here but for decision making not…It's because I mean, we, we did our own research... we didn’t talk to them much. But once we were here, they helped us out. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how long did the initial like this visa process take?', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tFive - Six months. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd finally, in terms of destinations, I suppose that you wouldn't considering Canada, could you go elsewhere?\", '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tCanada was our top priority and that’s because it is closer to the US. So, I had that in mind like if anything didn’t work out in Canada, I could always go to the US since I had my contacts and all. Also when you become a Canadian citizen, you can work in the US on a different kind of visa. So that’s an added point as well. So yes, Canada was on the top for us. I can say it was the only priority. If not Canada, then we would go back to India. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo as a Canadian citizen, you can pretty much go and work there indefinitely, right? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tYeah. So you get something called CN work visa and you get it at the border. So you don't need to worry about the lottery and…So you can get the visa and keep on renewing it. So, it's better compared to the work visa. You’ll never get a green card on that visa but you can stay there and work there indefinitely. And its still a skills-based visa. So you need to have a certain degree and you need to work in a certain profession. Then only, they will give you that visa.  \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo tell me about your skills now I mean like what what is what is the skills that you applied with? How do you consider yourself a skilled migrant? ', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tSo I mainly work in IT consulting. I have like around 10 years of experience. I did my Masters.. that’s management information systems from Buffalo. State University of New York at Buffalo. So I have a Business technical consultant background. So I work both on the business side and on the technical side. So right now im working for a banking client here. So that’s where, I have my skills. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo I suppose my question so I'll ask you the question and then based on the question you can map it out, right? So tell me about all the visa categories that you went through from the point of your initial departure from India to current status. \", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tSo this is Singapore one. And then you also have from here.. the US. So that was from Singapore.. that’s the student visa. And then US work visa. So student visa for like 2 years and then you get the student related work visa which is the H1B. And then you get H1B which is 3 years and then you get a H1B extension that’s again for two years. So you get for six years but if your company files a green card for you and if you are at a certain stage for your green card, you can get it extended for n number of years. So I was in the process. I was in the middle of that process of filing my green card. So, I could have extended it for n number of years. So I would say within Green Card process. So you don't actually get the green card, but because you have crossed a certain stage in your green card process, you can extend your work visa indefinitely. So maybe just say extending it indefinitely. Then I took the permanent residency.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo commercial services that you used in your migration journey from initial stages to even your current status. So I want you to think about between this part so this was work related so work did everything for you. So pretty much all of the processes throughout this process where you spend money?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tSo Singapore I didn't have to spend anything. My company did my work visa. They did my flight tickets and everything as well, initial accommodation as well. So nothing here. So US student visa, I actually hired a consultant to help me out with selecting the universities, doing like a lot of paperwork for different universities. So, I had I hired a consultant. The consultant was based in India, Delhi. They took inputs from me, of course, and then they like based on my GRE score and my TOEFL scores, they advised which universities would be like ambitious for me, which will be like, suitable for my score, which will be like, like, easier to get into. So they divided the list of universities in three categories. And then I like, I applied to a few in the ambitious category, few where I would get in easily and few where theres a 50:50. And I got in between, So GRE is generally like it's maths and English. And TOEFL is just English. Yeah. So GRE is what gets you admission in like science courses and then TOEFL is the one for English. I mean, these are different tests. So I got a decent score in the first attempt in GRE. So I didn't have to take it multiple times. But yes, you can take it multiple times and apply with different schools. And you get your health insurance from the university as well. Yeah. So you need to pay like a little amount and that was discovered by the university. But yeah, like flight tickets from Singapore to US.. I did them and then universities have their application fees as well. I would have applied for like five universities and then I got an admit from like 3 universities and then I had to choose like, one of those 3 universities. A lot of thought went into it, like one thing was return of investment, like how much I how much my tuition fees would be, and what I'm expecting, like, a package once I graduate from there, how easy to get a job. So that was one of the criterias. Like, there was a university, which was really good, but the fees was too high for me. So I didn't accept that invite. So that was like some of the considerations. So tuition fees. I use, like Facebook groups. University had a Facebook group. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd in terms of now, Canadian, PR what was some of the commercial services that', '', 'you have an agent for this one?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tNo, I didn't have an agent. I so this was something called Canada visa forums. So I used those forums to get all my knowledge and information. They were they helpful.\", '', \"We don't need an agent for Canada. So they have a whole process. So first I need to give the IELTS exam and then I had to get my degrees verified from WES – both for me and my wife. So that was the pre, the process before I applied. Once I got selected in the express entry... So, you get a particular NOC code so you apply in a particular code. So probably that's where my skill came into picture. I was able to apply in I think software consulting code or something like that and I also got nomination from Ontario. But I didn't have to use it because I already had submission points. But that's again based on the NOC code that I had applied into. I had like 478 points. So I didn't have to use but Ontario wanted to give space based on your NOC code, so they did give it to me. but that's a longer process. And I had enough points without PNP. So, there was more that I had to spend here. We had to show money, we had to do medicals, \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd this point [US work visa] was your wife with you as well. ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tNo - she was in India. It was a typical arranged marriage. But she took the student visa. So she studied in the US as well and I invested in her study, so that's a whole different process. She came as my dependent. Then she switched to student visa. And then she was applying to apply for US work visa. So I was on h1 and so she came on H4 dependent visa. And then switched to F1 student visa. So F1 and then she again, switched to my H4 because she didn't get the h1B. So after H1, theres something called the OPT visa. So you can work for… so that's like a student work visa. OPT. So if you are from a technology background, you get it for three years. But if you are like an MBA or architect in her case, you get it for one year. So if your course is not part of STEM courses, you get it for one year. Otherwise you get it for three years. So, she got it for one year. That's why she was able to work with us for a year after graduating.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what does this h4 dependent process have? Like you must show some paperwork there too, right? ', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tYeah but that was handled by company. Typically, h1 visa is handled by your company they do all the paperwork. I mean, they of course ask you documents, but then they have their own attorneys and lawyers who take care of submitting and everything. Student visa is you but work visa, your company does everything. They need to file on your behalf. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tI mean, the initial student visa would have been the main process for your wife', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tSo we did the same thing like hired a consultant back in India again, again, and she was in India when we were doing this process. So you give your GRE, you give your TOEFL. So she had to go through thw whole thing and again applying in multiple universities and then you get an admit. Like I've lived in so many cities, Toronto is where I can say okay, this is such a good diverse city. I really like it actually. It's very, very nice. Like, we were married for like four years in US. But we had a baby only when he moved to Toronto just in last one years because we feel like this is a place where we can settle down. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tReally? Wow, that's interesting. So, what is it about this place that makes you feel that way?\", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tIts so open. Like I’m a Muslim. I was fasting I went to my office. The white guy in my office… I told him I am fasting… the white guy in my office. He kept his chips bag in his bag. So that was like new to me. Like in US no one knew about it. What is it about…what I'm doing? But here I could be myself and still I would be accepted. I think the diversity aspect. People know here. They have grown up with with diverse people. So, they are open to that. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo we will move on, sorry, to the questions of this forums. And I want to know ask you about generally about technology. So tell me about the role of technology apart from your technology degree…from the initial sort of research stages to current migration status, conducting online research, resources that you used, or what sort of forums that you used social media that you used for any sort of general broad uses of technology as well.', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tOkay, so yeah, I mean, again, for doing research about the US universities, I did a lot of online research. I joined some Facebook groups. So those groups were, like specific to those University. So they were so it was mainly for Indian students. So Indian student organizations would be there in each university. They would interact with the aspiring candidates and help them in making a decision as well. So Indian Student Associations at universities. So they helped in settling as well. Like when you arrive at the airport, someone will come to pick you up and they will help you get a room as well. So I mean you need to pay for it but at least someone is showing up at the airport in a new city, new country at odd hours during the night, and then they give you like initial accommodation for a week. So they will arrange accommodation with another student who would keep you in your in their house for the week until you find your own accommodation. And take you around Walmart and all, help to buy stuff and help get a phone connection, everything so they actually help you during the first week. The expectation is that once you become a senior you will help other students too. So Canada visa forums is where I got most of the information from starting from how to take the IELTS exam, how to do WES degree verification. Luckily like because I did my masters in us I didn't have to get my Indian degree verified otherwise in getting my Indian degree verified would have been a big hassle…sending my documents from India to US. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat about like a regulatory stuff like police checks and stuff? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tOh, yeah. So that was part of post ITA… like when we did our medical. We had to get police check done from India, Singapore and US. So, for my wife India and US. For me, India, Singapore and US. That process was fine for India like we had to write to Chicago to the Indian embassy and we got it in a day.  For Singapore I had to send my fingerprints to Singapore for verification. For US it was a lengthy process... not a lengthy process but it was time consuming …took me three months to get my FBI check from US. So, from Singapore and India, it was quicker but from US it took a lot of time because that's how their process is. So they take you fingerprints and then they give a report saying all clear or something. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo actually, I think I'll try back a little bit. Why not? Why did you have to go and study in the US? Like, why didn't you want to do your masters in India? \", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tSo the thing was, you know, to get in a good MBA college, for example, in India, there's so much competition there. It's difficult to get it. So, getting a university admit for US was much easier than getting a university admit in India, because there's so much competition. They have something called quota system, so that pulls you down as well. If you are not in quota, then you have like limited number of seats that you can applying to in general category, you have like 30-40% of seats that you can apply for and the quota is restricted for minority caste. Its not based on your religion, its based on your caste. So if you belong to a certain caste, like schedule caste, then you get into it and that pulls you down as well because most of the seats in government colleges are reserved, and even jobs and jobs as well for government offices you have that reservation. So, so for general category, you have a limited number of seats, and so much competition like everyone is doing Engineering or something like that, and then everyone wants an MBA. So IIMs are for MBA and IITs are for IT. So to get an admit in the top 30 Universities in India, it's like very difficult and the other thing is the return of investment. Like you spend like a lot of money in India. So those colleges are expensive. They are cheaper compared to US, but they're still like, half the fees as you pay to the US. So you pay that much amount and after that if you get a job, which is a high paying job in India, but still, it's going to take 10 years to pay that load. So you don't want to be stuck in that. In the US, okay, the fees is high but the salary is very good. So you can like pay your student loans, pretty quickly. So like, I paid my student loan in one year. So I got it the student loan from India. Yeah. So there was like 11%, 10% interest. Same for my wife as well. My wife was, it took like two years [to pay off] because hers was like a huge amount. Mine was not that high. Like for my student loan, I just put some money in a fixed deposit. But for my wife because it was like a huge amount, so we did have to like mortgage my house back in India. So, you give you a house papers to the bank. They keep it and then you need to keep paying and once you're done they will give it back. So this was my dad’s property. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo the role of family that you want to maybe put on your map?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tFor for the US as well, you need to show the money. So, yes my dad helped out with that. So you need to show a bank statement that you have tuition amount for one year for the first year. So bank statement and loan amount like loan statement that you will be getting a loan. That’s what becomes your….His bank statement and loan - they are the I'd like to two separate things. So you need to show cash as well. So we had to show a letter saying that he's he would be like, financing my studies. And then he showed his bank statement as well his salary slips as well – everything. Marriage is important…So much in migration, like they were supportive. But like, when I even came to US, I told my dad I'm going to US and quitting my job in Singapore was like, What is what are you gonna do there? I was like, study there. I told him that I got an admit for these universities and he was like okay how much?.. and I said..this much I can afford, and this much, you’ll have to help me out. So for making that decision, it was my decision, but they were supportive of it. Then tell me okay no you cant go or anything like that. Marriage did play a role. Like staying in the US, I was on work visa. My wife was in a different city. I was in a different city. She was studying in a different city which was like, six hours drive. And then she was working in a different city as well and that was a 4 our drive. So I would go on Friday and come back on Monday. So, it did, it became a task. Now were both in Toronto…we both live in the same city, we both work here. It was because of jobs and stuff. Like the city where I was, she wanted to study architecture. There was not many good universities around that area. So, we had to find her a university that was slightly far. And then for work as well. You need to work in an architecture firm which would sponsor your work visa. So they will not many forms in my city who are willing to sponsor the visa. So whatever job she got in a different city, she had to take it because they would have sponsored her work visa. I was working in Indiana. She studied in Kansas and she was working in Missouri. But they are like adjoining states but still different states. And my parents were supportive of that, her parents were supportive of that so that’s where the family came in. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, social connections friends, not just not family anymore but just friends or community, um, even professional networks. Have they played a role? And do you want to put them on the map?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tYes, for example like for this Canada thing, I told Canada visa forums, but then I had few colleagues in my company who are helping me out as well. And then when I told my employer that I got a Canada PR, so they, they were supportive. They like they made me travel from Toronto to Indiana. They paid for the flight, they paid for the accommodation, they paid like $60 for food as well per day. Just so that I can stay in Toronto, and my wife can. So my employer was supportive as well. So it was Deloitte Consulting. But the salaries are not as high as US. So the salary they were offering me here in Toronto was… so it was same as in US numbers. But again, you have that Canada to US conversion, right. So I wasn't very keen about it, so I moved, I joined another company called Accenture consulting. And my company partner who I was working for. He was like you can like travel from Toronto indefinitely. You can keep on working in US and keep on staying in US till whenever you want. But I was like, No, I need to find our local job coz it’s a commute right? Like Monday I need to go to Pearson airport, and then do my immigration because I have a work with US. So every I have an immigration and every Thursday I have an immigration to come back. So like at the airport, I need to get my passport stamped every week. That’s a lot of stamps. And US they ask “Why do you want to go” and all but because they have all your trips recorded. So after a while they are fine. Like they don't ask you anything… they know. I mean, I would know the visa officer as well. They would just stamp it but then still a hassle to go, need to stand in a line to get your passport stamped and everything. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo in terms of your family, are they are they happy with your migration to Canada? Would they like to come here?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tThey're happy actually. So my parents came to US once. They came to Canada just now like few months back. They were helping us out with the kid and all, and they really liked it. They like it in Canada just because of the community. So I currently live in Milton. That's like, yeah, it's like too far from here. But initially when I came here for one year, I was living at Humboldt Park. So that's like very close to downtown. So that's when me and my wife are working here and now she's on mat leave. We needed to buy a house. Toronto is too expensive. So we need to move into the suburbs. The baby is 3 months old. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tI'm going to talk just about broad stuff. aside, so current immigration policies like do you do you keep on top of immigration policies? Are you interested in them?\", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tYes, I am very on top of immigration policies basically with what's happening in the US. I have a lot of friends there who seek my advice on there will be if they want to move to Canada, they seek my advice. And I'm also helping my sister for getting her PR in Canada and my brother as well who is on US work visa. So I'm like, on top of things what's happening in US and Canada. I think the US is biased. So there's a bill that is in senate right now, which is gonna remove the country wide quota for the green cards. If that happens, then an Indian person would get the green card in the same time as someone from any other nationality. But then the catch there is like people from suppose Pakistan – right now, they get green card in 2 years, but after that, if that bill is passed, they will get it in seven years or eight years. It standardizes time so it's bad for them but good for Indian, Chinese and Filipinos. Again, like in US the visa is based on lottery. It should be based on your profile. Like in Canada, they give points to your profile based on your work experience, your education, your age, and all that but in US it is still lottery. I think they were saying that theyre gonna make the green card based on your skills and your profile. But no, right now it is not. It's more of family based. So, if you have your brother is there, you can sponsor your dad for green card. Not like in Canada… like Canada you have like a proper express entry and a proper points-based system. Im in favor of the point the system because it gives an equal opportunity to everyone. Not just because you have your relatives here, you're getting a residency. Someone like me, who didn't have anyone here but still I got it so easily. It was because of this express entry point system. No [other countries considered].. It's just because I was aware of the American lifestyle, North American lifestyle. If I had to go in Australia, I had to start it from zero again, understand how jobs, things work, everything I have to start from scratch. But for moving to Canada it was just like putting my stuff in my car and then crossing the border. I drove. So it was like pretty easy compared to if I had to move to Europe or... Like I have my cousins who studied in France and are living in different cities in Europe. I think life in Canada is easier than what we are facing there because it's English here…language thing… like France and all you need to learn French and then it's difficult to learn at this age. With Canada also, I didn’t consider any other city because this is where you have most jobs. So right now, Im working with financial clients and a lot of times they have their offices in Toronto. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd I suppose now we can go in terms of your migration advice that you're giving your family and friends or do you actually actively helping them with the process? Are you involved in broader sort of forums kind of stuff as well? \", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tNot in forums. But I like, theres a lot of colleagues back in the US who Im helping with their PR stuff. I have friends in India who I'm helping, but not on forums, its like a lot of personal advice rather than giving consultancy. I mean, they already made the call that they want to come to Canada and just helping them out in the process and all and then telling them the pros and cons of coming here because there are a lot of cons as well. Like if you don't get a job, then it's a really expensive to stay. Youll be out of your money like pretty soon. So the job thing is amazing, I mean, once you get a decent paying job, its great. I mean, it took me like two weeks because I had a North American degree and its IT consulting right? For my wife as well actually. She gave an interview when we moved to Toronto and then she got her job. Just if she would have been coming from India, like my sister will be coming from India, it will be a lot tougher. Because you're already in North America. I think that helps. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tI suppose now in terms of sponsoring your family that you are helping your sister. What about your parents?', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tThey won’t move here. They will stay back. They will come here for vacation but then go back.

Like my wife, she'll be going there in November and stay there for like, three, three months. So yeah, we make a point that we go there every year, sometimes twice in a year as well. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd finally, I suppose I want to talk to you more about like, even looking at the map, what are the biggest sort of obstacles and challenges that you faced throughout your journey throughout? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tI think starting with Singapore, I was out from India for the first time but it's a totally different culture in Singapore. So, getting used to that culture was a culture shock. Like there is a big Indian community there and Singapore is also very nice, very safe and all. There’s like 3 national languages Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. But then, I can say Tamil people are the most racist… racist people I have come across. Like there are a lot of, like, Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils - even my colleagues there who were from there, they would be like, “why are you here”? So that was like issue. South India and North India – theyre like different. Like our common language is English. So that's the thing so that was one thing that I found in Singapore that was bit of a culture shock, or culture gap. Although everything was English so that was helpful but yeah first time out from my country away from my family. It took me some while to settle. I had to ask, like, two people in the train that… will you want to take an apartment with me because it was so expensive that I cannot take an apartment myself. Yeah, so that was for Singapore. Food - getting used to the food there. Now they have a lot of different kind of food but back then….this was in 2010-2012 (2012-2018 was US)… I think the visa issues in US, like I wanted to change my company but I was sticking with them because I didn’t want to get my H1B visa cancelled. It’s a hassle right because it takes four months, five months. Even if the other company takes us till they need to wait five months, and then they will never know whether your visa will be… your transfer will be approved or not. I wanted to move out of Deloitte, but I had to stick with them. Because I was scared of doing the visa process, just a process. It's like so cumbersome.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what did you get a job straight away after you graduated? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tThat was very good. IT jobs – it was very easy. My wife is so anti IT as well – I don’t know why. I mean, honestly I have such a boring job. Like my wife, her output is like a building. My output is like a piece of software. I don't know.. how you can quantify it. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tMaybe looking at the map, I suppose. Can you tell me what.. how you feel about it?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tI mean we can add more stuff to it but it looks good. I mean, I feel good recalling everything. Definitely like I was I'm along the way. And my family's proud of that as well like my dad. He lived in a town in India. And then for his work he moved to Delhi. That's like a bigger city. I grew up in Delhi, but then I moved abroad. So that's like a progress for us. But then when I go back to India, I stay in my hometown so yeah. I feel proud.\", '', '', 'M:\\tSo would you consider migration elsewhere?', '', '', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tNo I think im done. So, my wife wants to move back to US at some point of time. Just because like you're getting better paying job opportunities there. Like, I might as well because like right now I have a… I have a like, loan on my house for like 20 years. I don't want to wait for 20 years to pay my loan. So, maybe just go to US, work 3-4years, get money and then pay off my house. I mean, salary wise as well and then in your day to day expenditures as well. I mean here the taxes are high, and stuff is cheap there compared to Canada. We have some tax there but like if you buy some items is 7% tax there. In Canada is 13% tax. And then house cost - the city I was living in US, the same house, it would have been one third of the cost that I paid here. That’s the difference. Salaries are high and housing, everything is cheap. So Canada is a place where you want to live a comfortable life, but you won't be saving much. And you want to save, like Salary as well…in US. Like, if you do an MBA from a top 10 University, and suppose Deloitte hires you, the amount of money they've give in US, for the same profile in Canada might be like half of that. If you move to a good city like Chicago, New York City, its good. Chicago has a lot more diversity, NYC has a lot more diversity. Just that in US, it's not very safe and the political environment there is again, I mean as a minority, you will feel certain things. Not so in Canada. At least they won't say it on your face. In US they can say it on your face. Like if you go to a Walmart in the US, and if my wife is in her ethnic wear, she will be little uncomfortable, like a suit.. but here nobody cares. Especially if you are in the smaller cities in the US, they're like, you really feel it.M:\\tSo when did you first move to Canada?\", '', '', '', 'Sa:\\tSo two months ago, so the 19th of August. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tOh, sorry, I should actually say this first is going to be a bunch of basic questions. And then I'll go into the mapping. And I'll tell you when I'm on the right. Perfect. So what were the motivations behind your move?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tIt was basically just for something different. And I'd been living in all the main cities in Ireland for a few years. A lot of my other friends had migrated, you know, and just kind of felt like everyone was getting on to do something new and different. And I kind of felt like it was my turn. So yeah.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay. And what were the factors that you considered so for example, was it just Canada always in your mind? Are you thinking about different countries or?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tYeah, well, I actually was just looking up, I was just googling places to live, you know. That's basically you know, and I hoped that I was going to move to Europe because you know I'm moving on my own so I was like oh, it'd be easier to travel back home and my sister lives in Berlin so she was there in case im tired of being alone. So I looked up places in France mainly and like other places but just nothing kind of really stuck out and then I know it's something that like in the week that I was deciding – I think about three things happened and Montreal came into my head…I think airlink had a direct flight which they promoted online and then, like things just kept popping up it like… it was the only place was kind of like calling me so I was like, its a bit further away and its a bit more expensive to be set but it just kind of was the only one calling out and that’s why I chose it. And like as well because I knew when people have gone Canada before and like although you have to go through the visa process. I mean, once you're there it kind of seems straightforward enough, whereas I know that France is known for its bureaucracy, and like filling out forms and making shit hard for you. So I was kind of like know that kind of put me off as well as a few friends that that had been there on Erasmus, and they were like, I don't know. So yeah, and cheap rent. That was a big thing coming from Dublin because I got so annoyed overpaying for stuff that wasn't good. And now I pay less. I paid for 700 euro for room in Dublin and now I pay less for an entire apartment to myself with bills included so it's Yeah, it's a lot better here…you get a lot more for your money here.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd did you do that sort of comparison between different cities?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tSo Canada so basically so I ruled out Vancouver originally because just I was like look, it's a bit too far away to the side. And because I've been there for I mean, I thought it was gorgeous like, I mean, I like I like if somebody told me to move there, like I would agree, its happening. So because I when I went to visit my friends over there, I was like, this is gorgeous. I can see why people wanna live here, its lovely. But it kind of was also felt like that was their thing they did it so I kind of wanted my own thing and then it was kind of between Montreal and Toronto. But like I said. Toronto seemed nice but it just… it just seemed like a kind of random city to me…there was nothing really pulling me towards it whereas Montreal, the culture of it just it seems I really wanted to try it and I always was like, Look, If I get tired, if it gets too hard with the French in Montreal, I can always move to Toronto. It's not that far like, I flew in from Toronto and I've been connected on flights from there anyway. So yeah, it's the same distance. So I mean, I still have it at the back of my head, I could always go but I don't know. I think I really like it here so. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd home is ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tIreland, in Galway. Not the city. It’s a town. Its like 40 minutes away from the city. So the West but it's more Midlands. It’s the home of Supermacs, which I don't know if you've heard of. It's just a fast food place in Ireland. And it's it's known for…it's a kind of a culty thing.. do you use the word culty? Yeah, it's culty thing. It’s like a big in Dublin for like different Kipper. Like they have like, you know, proper divides with salt and vinegar and stuff whereas supermarkets sell it but they don’t have that kind of stuff…I think they there was some talk of it and bringing one to Australia a few years ago because of so many Irish living in Australia. But I think that fell through but there are actually I actually don't know if there are if it's gone international. But here's so many in Ireland. There's four in our town. Yeah it’s a big thing. Anyway, that's your claim to fame.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tNow tell me a little bit about your professional background. So what type of work do you have been doing and what type of work do you do currently? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tYes. So when I left college, I had absolutely zero idea what to do. So I was working in a cafe I think, just before I finished my degree, so I stayed there for another six months, I think and then I moved to cork and my goal was to get work with like newspapers get some sort of a journalism writing job. So when I moved there Initially, I just wanted to get any sort of job and right away. So I worked in a cafe for a while and I was like, okay, it's fine. I'll do this for a few months and then I'll get my proper job. And then I ended up loving working there. And people there were so nice, it was like a little family so and after a few months of working there, I was made assistant manager. And then I was like, Oh my god, I actually really like this. Maybe I'll open a cafe myself, you know what I mean? I was kind of toying with that idea. And I stayed there for two and a half years, I think. And at the time, I had gotten a freelance job with The Echo paper in Cork. So I was like, writing the odd article for them. And then I also got a recurring job with Roscommon paper closer to back home. And when I got a weekly article, go with him, so I kind of was doing that on the side. So I kind of felt like I was nurturing and whatever writing I wanted to get done. And then towards the end of it, I was moving out of Cork and I was like, Look, I want to get My big girl job now [laughs], so am I said I flew home for a while to try and figure it out. So year. Summer of 2016. Yeah, I moved home for the summer while I was looking for jobs. And then yeah, I got this one in Dublin so it was a sort of editor job for Sci-fi website. So it wasn't so much writing. It was like, just when I read the job spec, I was like, Oh, I can do this. It was literally just like, obviously, correcting grammar and doing mistakes. And I was like, Yeah, no, I'm perfect for this. I literally used to correct everyone's essay in college and like I used to do that for my brother and sister and like, I'm, you know, like, people who are like… known. Like, you got this wrong and like, You spelled this wrong, you know, so people are like, yeah, that's my job. So I did that for three years. And I loved it. It was so good. And I learned loads because I had not actually got any clue on this sci tech stuff. So I kind of thought it'd be a struggle. But then if I could look it up, like the lingo and whatever… And it was good because it was the kind of website that was trying to be accessible to the everyday person. So, it wasn't wired. It wasn't like reading each audience was kind of like, you know, so it was kind of actually good to have me there. Because, you know, they might say something and I'm like, Well, I don't really know what that is. So if I don't know what it is somebody else wont. So yeah, I was kind of trying to make the language more accessible. So that was kind of so you know, and then I didn't know I was between leaving that job and finding something else in Dublin, you know, something along the similar thing. But then I just, I felt like I needed something a bit, a bit more. So, I said, I'd moved here and the aim was to kind of stay in the same field, but I was kind of like, I don't care. So I kind of saw it as a career break. And I'm not here to, you know, it's kind of here for the experience rather than, you know, so I knew as well I'd be narrowing down my options. I don't speak French. So, I was kind of like, nope, I'll go and I figure it out. If its a job in my industry, Great. I just was kind of like Ill do whatever there's to gain experience…but luckily I got something similar now I guess write a bit more so it's been more I guess… so its copywriting so to describe toys for kids, and so like there’s a bit of editing and like doing newsletters and stuff like that. So yeah, it's I think it's perfect because it's similar enough to you know, that kind of an industry but also a bit more… like describing toys for kids..more accurately for the parents because theyre the ones who are going to be buying and but we're launching an app now for kids to play with so like even think of all the everything that goes on behind the scenes, like you know, you need to write the Appstore descriptions, you need to write game instructions, all this kind of stuff that needs to… it is for like three year olds, but also it's kind of like trying to align the language. So I mean, you want to make it fun and accessible, but then again you're not advertising to kids, you’re advertising to their parents. So, it’s kind of trying to pick the right language.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo you degree was in Journalism?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tNo, it was Art. So it was it was it was weird course. It was an Arts course with a specialism in human rights. So that was what I was very interested in the start. And the first year you do four subjects, I'm in the second year you drop to three and all the time your specialism is it's meant to be the four and they encourage you to do a placement. And so, I went to London for three months. And then I went to Geneva three months. And the goal was to find some, like I was working in NGOs and just being an intern and yeah, trying to work in like kind of fields you might be interested in. And then I went for one in Geneva because they needed a French speaker and you had to keep up with your French because that was my other subject… and then my final two, they we're in English and French and with the specialism of human rights, but you don't get final grade with your specialisms and so it's a bit weird that it's on the degree title and then you don't really, its not like you're qualified for anything. So and the thing that I love the most in the course was English and I knew when I finished then I was like I probably should’ve taken a year out after my exams and I probably should have done a straight Journalism course…probably would have liked it more, but you don't know that when you’re 18 or whatever.

I mean maybe of course Never Say Never, if I find something that I really wanted to do and I do, then kind of.. like also have a pin in that like if I want to find some difference. I just didn't know myself I just wanna get some experience rather than get a degree. I mean, I know people that have worked at night like whatever they've done like a degree.

I think, probably this time of year, I was kind of formulating ideas and playing with the idea of Montreal. And so I kind of decided at Christmas and then from January then I kind of started the whole visa process? So it took about January to April, I think just getting all the documents sorted, waiting, like it takes a few weeks each time and all that stuff. And then I got it in April. Yes. And then from April to August was just, like quit my old job and kind of plan the move, looking at flights, looking at jobs You know do everything I could do about it. Yeah. That was basically it. So this is pretty much about a year, like less than a year maybe.

Or did you also consider like, hey, maybe I could get PR directly or things like that. Were you considering on the visa options? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tNot really, I think I was leaning towards this one, because I knew people who…don't know it's slightly different process to when they did.. but I knew most people had done this for Montreal. They all were like, it's grand. Its easy, like you apply, theres obviously like, you can get refused but I didn’t see any reason as to why that might be. I thought it was going to be straightforward enough. So no, I think there's only one that I was considering because I wanted to be open as well. It's an open work permit that I have. So I didn't want to like I didn't know if I could get directly like I mean, say like say the company I was working for in Dublin was international if I knew they had and office Montreal, it was perfect. That was great. I would have been wanting to sponsor me or whatever. But because I wanted it to be open I was like, that was it seemed like the best option. And I didn't. To be honest, I didn't look into too many other options for Europe. I think maybe because, I don't know, I think the Canadian website is done pretty well, like its pretty straight forward, I couldn't think straight forward because it's literally like, here's you, here's what you need, here's all your steps. Whereas I think with other places, it's kind of it's not like easily laid out for you. It's kind of like you need to go and find the information yourself. So I didn't really delve too much into it. This was the only one that I found pretty much everything on easily. And yeah it's interesting to me. My brothers in Australia too and he got into trouble because he wanted to apply for permanent residency at some point and then it just seemed pretty like convoluted and like… Whereas this… I mean, a friend of mine was applying as well at the same time, I don’t think theyre going to come in now but I think they just wanted to look at the option and they're like, Oh, can you understand this website. It is so confusing. I was like, literally, it’s the easiest one, not being like whatever, but I think it was like so well laid out, they kind of make it clear, and the time you need all these documents and you need all this.

The fact that I suppose my brother and sister living abroad – like it wasn't the biggest deal so I was like, oh, like my parents are used to it. I mean, I kind of felt bad leaving initially coz its like Im the kid that’s going now but my brother had just moved from Australia and now ..it was kind of weird timing because the day my flight left was the day he moved into Dublin so I was a bit disappointed with that because I was like, I would have liked to have been in Dublin for a while when you were there. But I kind of was also felt like a cross over, I was like right you can look after the parents now. I think it would have felt bad leaving if all 3 of their kids were not home. But hes home now. Hes living in Dublin. So, and then my sister Yeah, she comes home often. She lives in Berlin and its not that far. And I think she's planning on staying up there another few years. So so it's kind of like, Oh, yeah, like, I could do this. Now they had obviously gone over with boyfriends or girlfriends, so and I hadn't. But I was like, Look, I mean, I think I want to do something for myself, and I want to do whatever. So. I don't know. Like, I mean, it was. I don't know. Yeah. Well, my parents, I think, like, Yeah, like that’s tough coz I used to go home like every two years or so. So yeah, if anything, they were a possible deterrent to me leaving. But. It's fine, to be honest. And that was a big thing in terms of choosing Montreal. So I was like that, you know, when when people are like, oh, we're immigrating. We're going to Canada or Australia. So theyre like, they have their big Irish group and everything there and then you don't see them for years, and it's a big thing. And I was like, Look, I don't want that. I want to go somewhere that's not that far of a flight, that I am gonna come home often and I do want people to visit me often. So I don't want to do this big “Oh my God I’m never gonna see you again”. I wanna come home for Christmas and have to come home in March again coz a friend of mines getting married. I want them to come out this summer. So it's kind of like I never want it to more than like two or three months without seeing someone. So yeah, that's probably there's probably a big factor in where I chose. Yeah, yeah, they would have stopped me from going like to like super remote, something like Australia. And then just as well, so my brother has been there and when he came home I hadn't seen him for like, 2 years. And I was like, this is very long, like, you know, and because it was so far away, so expensive to go, it really was a deterrent. like, you'd be talking at least two grands for fights. And then like, with here, it depends on when you go… I think my Christmas flight home is going to be expensive but well in general its like $500 return. So I mean, which is quite good. I mean, obviously, you still cant go over board, because it's still an expensive life. But I mean, if you can get there to get directly in like six and a half hours or something, its not that bad. I mean there are places in Europe which are like the same. So its kind of like, so yeah, they’re are a big factor in what way right.

Yeah, I'm good at basically taking a big pile of crap and trying to turn it into something concise and readable, and it's making it clear. So I think I'm good at that. And then writing. I done know, I started off again now and I mean, when I did articles and stuff before, they were all really like opinion pieces that like my own mind, whatever I thought, and I think now that I'm writing, although its fun, I don't think its like my strongest skill I think. Im good at it but it definitely can be better. I don't think I'm as good at imagination. I think I'm good at writing down what I know, and what I believe. And, and you know, there's that little push.

I think I'm quite independent. Yeah, I mean, obviously, I'm here on my own. So, I'm kind of quite optimistic. I think so kind of, like, if I kind of was like, I knew what might hard to be on my own. And I was, like, comforting to know that it will be that like, the worst that will happen is that I can always go back home. I know, it's gonna it's fine. Like to me, I'm, like, you know, ive been on my own in the past as well. So I think this is a personality thing. So yeah. Yeah, I think, I think probably, it's not like, like if I wasn’t enjoying it, I think I'd be very proactive and Be like okay, well Oh my god, this is awful. I'm just gonna go home, you know what I mean? So like initially coming year, had a bit of, like I was worried about like health things and getting set up with health insurance and stuff like that so I didn't have a scare and I'm kind of like, Oh no, maybe I should just go home, but I'm like no things will get good, its fine. last week got a mouse in my apartment I was like, Well, I'm gonna leave the apartment, Im just gonna go rather than trying to deal with that thing. Yeah, so luckily my landlord is very good at he came around to me tand he sorted it out for me. But I think like I went to go stay in a hotel and I was like, literally like, I cant. I had a bad week last week. I think I was just like, because it was the first time I actually felt truly alone here. I was like okay, there's my stairs.. where I'm going to go when I was like There's no one like I can see…I don't know anyone I can stay with or anything. You know, so when I left the apartment, I need to go to the hotel so it's kind of lonely and a bit like oh now and then I'm kind of thinking of like ‘Oh What am I doing here?’ Maybe I shouldnt be here, you know, the spiral. So, you know, you have that then I was kind of like, No, no, we'll be fine in a few days, we'll get rid of it. You know, trying to, I think go to trying to be like, fine, you feel shit for a while and then get up and move on with it. So, I mean enough to say that if I hate… if I continue to, like, have bad swings here that I’ll leave, like, I'm not gonna worry about like, what people think you know, whatever. But for now I think yeah, this is what I want. I think Yeah, as well as that I think because it was in my house and then it was like, you know, when you come over on your own like, literally have like one base where you call home then you don't you don't have friends ,you don't have your family or whatever. So that's the one place where I could go and then I was like theres a mouse here. I was like, I can't stay here and I’m not comfortable here and then it was like if I’m not comfortable here then I'm not comfortable anywhere in this country so then it was kind of like probably a bit of an overreaction. It was just a mouse. It was fine. But you know it's little things like that they've kind of made me feel.. I hope that it was just one like when my landlord came out and checked, he checked everything like holes and like droppings anywhere. There was nothing. So he's like, I'm fairly sure it's just one mouse and it got caught in the trap and it was the worst night of my life because I had to hear it dying. But it's gone now and I think I haven't noticed that the last few nights. So fingers crossed. Fingers crossed. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tMapping:', '', '', '', \"M:\\tlet's just start with all the processes that you went through. \", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tSo, I'm just gonna say roughly, and I'm going to maybe do a timeline. Yeah. So December is when I started looking at so… like, the first thing I have is just the websites, yes, just going on to like, government, Canada website. So okay, research on that. And then there was a list of documents you needed. So that involves checks say when you go to a doctor, and that was like going to the guards [police] to get approval of stuff. And that's stuff, like CVs, references. Like just basic info look I don't think it was something that nothing was like I'm… probably getting the Garda cert was the hardest because when they send it and they were like two weeks to get this back to us and whatever so that was pretty… of fingerprints as well. Biometrics yeah and then that was everything that I kind of give to them and then just go with it. There was no other real intermediary or like I didn't have to do with any lawyers or any other people. I was basically just doing my own thing, just going through the website. That’s everything they needed before I came. I'm going to say August then. When I came I had to go through customs and then copies of it all the documents that I needed initially of  money in my account, all right, okay and bank details and money so basically they either needed to have certification that you’re going to leave the country like a flight booked back home or your money to prove this you could stay there. They needed, I think it was 1500 dollars for this 1500 – 2000 Canadian dollars. Just make sure that you could pay for somewhere to stay for a while. And then for your flight back home so okay and they needed like full copies of all my IDs like everything like my passport and like all this I am who I am. I think that was everything then then they checked it over and then they gave me a SIN number. I thought that I had to go to like a place for it, like a separate office but they have a place right beside customs that if you want to pay something extra, like they'll process there. That’s what youre going to need to get your work permit. So they gave me the sin number and they gave me the work permit all there. And yes then when I was leaving the airport, I had everything ready that I needed to set up like for a job and the health cards is a big different, in that, you can only get it if you have an established employer, there was some other things in that I didn't have either. So I wasnt eligible for it. But I am eligible for health insurance at work after three months, so I have to sort that in January. I think that’s it. So the health insurance I have is a basic package it's like done, they do it for your visa. Its like a package for travel for like advice and stuff and then for basically health emergency so like if I die or if I have an accident. It doesn't cover like general medical and all that. You have to have a Canadian healthcare or you can pay private for it. So when I came here, I did have to go to a private health clinic. So I had to pay all those fees because I didn't have a health card and because I didn't have health insurance yet at work. So you have to pay all those fees yourself. It was my own like check-up. It was something that I want to get done even before I came over and I didn't have time. So, like doing over here it cost me more money. Yeah, you do have to go to a private clinic. Like that took a while actually trying to figure that. I tried like three numbers being like look Im not from here, like, where do I go? And then I was being directed to somewhere else. But the bottom line is it has to be private, you have to pay up. I think you can try and get like advisor has insurance, but like I think as long as I did, but it's not urgent. It's kind of like that's on you. That's the main thing.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd in terms of like spending money on all of these processes, do you have like a sort of a rough estimate in your mind of how much you spent on?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tOh Money! okay. So initially you have to pay I think its like $200 or 100 and 150 I think to actually apply to get a visa. And the visa itself and then you have to pay an extra I think it's 100 or something like that for biometrics and that's a new thing. I don't think my friends had to do it when they moved over. Yeah, it's definitely the last two years that they made it mandatory.  For all the documents and stuff I don't I think had to pay anything. Oh I had to pay for a new passport. So basically, I wouldn't need it. Basically my passport went up to until April 2021 but as my visa was going to be up till August 2021, even though I'm probably not gonna stay here longer than a year, I had to prove to them that I wasn't going to let my passport run out before my visa. So I had to pay for that. So that was like 80. that was everything for the prep then after that was like Yeah, so the flight out was like 550.. that was a one way so it wasn't hugely cheap for a one way. Airbnb for two weeks while they, you know, like, new clothes, preparing for the winter. Like I packed lightly because I wanted to buy all of my clothes here. And then I came.. initially, like setting up and everything so I don’t think it cost anything to set up, but cost to set up a new phone, internet, and gym just like as an option. Yeah, and then like your rent, because I think you can't take your deposit as rent, they're not supposed to. Some landlords try and get to pay the last months rent… like in Ireland you would always be asked to pay 1 months rent as deposit plus the rent and advance whereas I don't want to do that here. I don’t think its illegal but basically you don't have to pay it but like a lot of landlords will want you to just as a security thing. So because my landlord, I got pretty good vibes from him and like I knew that it was a good person he’s like, Look like, its just to cover ourselves. So I did pay it. I had set it aside to do that because I just assumed I would have to. Like I had done the research, but I kind of knew as well and there was a possibility that I needed to pay a bit extra. So yeah, that was an extra cost. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how did you find the place? Do you like an agent? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tWell, No. Basically I did searches on Kijiji and Craigslist.And then, what else, nothing more than the usual expenses of getting set up somewhere new like getting your travel bags as well. and then yeah. all the new life stuff because the houses aren’t furnished here. So I need to get a bed, and a couch. It was grand because the guy that living here was moving to Alberta. So, he didn't want to bring any of his stuff with him. So, I got a lot of stuff from him and he gave it to me for cheap. So he gave me like his bed, his couch and stuff like that – it was $200 it was great and it was obviously in the apartment, otherwise I would have had to like go out and sort it all myself and that would have been a pain because I'm gonna have to buy like everything. Here I had to buy like cups and saucers and knives and cutlery, like everything so yeah..I mean it was a grand because I mean I think some of them don't even have fridges or they don't have an oven or a microwave or anything like that but they're extra expenses for coming here though.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo were you always going to be looking for a house for yourself like you did not want to share with anybody? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tUm, yeah, like that was the aim. I knew was going to be my so there was like no other opportunity for me to live on my own. Because I couldnt afford to do that in Ireland and we don't even have studios either. Like you might find them if you did a search, like one or two vacant ones. But its not really there…everyone just shares big houses whereas here it was, it was almost the norm to find one bedroom apartments. So I was like and it was a lot cheaper. So even though it's dear by Montreal standards, for me like it's quite cheap so I think it was the only opportunity that I was going to have so I was like I gotta try it. So that's why I did it. I mean, I could have gotten a room for like $200 anywhere and save some money but I kind of wanted my space, and figure out everything so yeah, it could be a lot cheaper to share. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tIs there a difference in income in terms of actual earning compared to Dublin?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tIts slightly less here I think and so what I'm earning now is the same as what I earned in my old job, I thought was gonna be slightly more because they tax more here. So it's not a huge amount. It's about roughly the same. But I'm definitely on a higher wage here than is average. Do you know what I mean. For the job that it is…So I think the wages are known to be slightly less…Yeah, it's cheaper… the cost of living here as well. So while you might get paid more in Dublin, you're gonna pay more for living, So I think it kind of balances out. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tYeah, yeah. So yeah. Cool. All right. Now let's talk about technology. Okay, so the role of technology in your migration. \", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tSo it was all to do with technology, and then moving here, it was finding the apartments online. And yeah, like “moving to Canada” Im just gonna write that website. Yeah, because that was such a great website it gave me all the resources. It was set up by an Irish man and he…. it's just so comprehensive it gives you everything like up when I signed up, they messaged me every two months. They were like, you said, you're moving on the 19th. By this stage you should have this sorted and you know. On the day that I moved, they’re like, congratulations you're on the move. And then they're like, here's a video of seven things you need to do when you get to Canada. So its like first do this and second do this. It was so great. So it's like such a good resource. So like, technology just like trying for like, coming here. And then when I came here and we should be right Montreal blog because it's like a, loads of Instagram accounts that follow it and just to like for tourism, see what was good here and. Oh Facebook groups. Like, you know yourself. And then, what else, searching for the job. Oh, LinkedIn. I got my job through LinkedIn. I've been searching on like Craigslist.. like in Ireland it’s a bit dodgy but here everyone posts jobs on Craigslist and there was like, like babysitting jobs, It was a secret shopper jobs, It was like, massage therapist, but like, yeah, you know, so it was a bit dodgy so I didn't find it that great so I went on linked in. So I got like, three or four calls from places after that. So I would recommend for job search. Like, I mean, I used Linkedin quite a bit in my last job and I was like Why don’t I use Linkedin more. Cant tell, it was like, Facebook in the way that Facebook used to be big and now Linkedin is for work, do you know what I mean? I mean I know it's all about the jobs and like whatever that's what it advertises, but it does actually work.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo these were actually job adverts on LinkedIn or you reached out to employers?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tno no no I was applying. There was a couple people I did reach out to but I didn't hear from them and I kind of know that like cold emailing and calling doesn't always work unless they're actively looking for someone like you. No, I applied to all the jobs and like a lot of them are easy applies as well, you can just click and apply to a lot of them. It's better than sending in a cover letter. Yeah, LinkedIn is great for that. And then at the job I'm in now and all of the toys and stuff are sold and targeted towards Amazon. So a lot of the works involves SEO keyword research. So that's a huge part of technology that I use every day. Oh yeah, Whasapp is key. I don’t use skype because we just use whatsapp now. So that's how I message everyone every day called everyone all the time. That's the my main source of communication for and then, like other social media say like for like us the likes of Instagram and yeah, you know, you know, so I'm gonna be the main source of communication issues. I mean, obviously, I’ve got inyternet set up at the house and everyone needs internet anymore. I got a good data plan joints with the phone. So that was good, because when I did have an internet issue, like I didn’t have internet for 2 weeks in the house. I was using up all the data on the phone and obviously going out and around, so its very important for like Google maps and all.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tGreat. Okay. And how long did it take you to get your job offer you arrived?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tLike three weeks so very lucky. Yeah. So basically, because I got the apartment so so… basically I came over on the 19th and I had the Airbnb for two weeks. So it's like I give myself the whole two weeks to just find the apartments. Obviously it might take longer or I'm not going to think about jobs, because my parents were like, “you don’t have a job yet, you sure you want to go over” and I was like no Im going to find the apartment first, that's key, and then look for a job. So because I found it so early, like I got here on the Monday and found the apartment by the Wednesday, like I got to spend all the rest of the time looking for the job. So cant remember the day and I actually got it but, I was assured that I had it so then I started on the 24th of September. It was an open work permit. So basically, I can work like the HR guys were like, okay, because you're from Ireland, I need to see your visa, I need to see your SIN number I need to see proof of my bank details but I think that was just to pay me. I don't think they need it. So once you get the permit and once its open, I mean, some of them. Obviously, if you came over with another company, and they were like it was a specified or if you're coming over to study, I don't think you can work anywhere. Like you don't mean you have to be a whole separate thing but because mine is very open, I can work for the whole 2 years. So I don't think I can stay here any longer than that. I mean, I think there is the possibility to apply for more time, but I think they brought in something new recently, that you might be able to extend your visa maybe in a year or two but in general unless you find like a specified job and they weren't willing to vouch for you and want you to stay longer..I was just two years ago I think it's fairly recent two years to do whatever you want and then after that leave..Yes, yes, it is. It was a pool. So like when you when you join first they were like applied to join some pool and then they're like welcome, youre in the pool. Now you have to apply to actually do something that's and then you do it and then they’re like, congratulations you did this. Now gives us this document… so was kind of like a little process like that, but it didn't really feel like full steps because I think the way they used to do it before, it was like a lottery and it took a lot of time and I remember my friend doing this, they were so stressed that … it would be like it could be sometime in March or April that we're just going to send you a message and then you can get on the internet and Its first come first serve. And it was like, I remember they were so stressed about it and then they got their thing whereas now I don't know whether the pools wider or its that they don’t have many? I don't think it's as likel at the time…so they're like between now and now… they'll let you know when the pools are open but I don't think it's like ….I think they gather all the first and then they select you from it. So it's not like the first person that gets in will get it. It's kinda like they do choose your from a list but I've never really felt that I was narrowed down or whatever. I think the likelihood of not getting chosen for it would you have to have something that would deter them like say like if your passport was invalid or if like updating the criminal records you cant come gere or like maybe if you've been here before and you're trying to apply again. So it didn’t really feel like it was…no maybe it was… maybe they chose me from list of people but like it didn't really feel like it was hugely selected because it was done so quickly. So It was like, within a day or two it was like here you’re approved for this, not move on to the next stage.. it was like this. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tyes. And the Airbnb accommodation may have you sorted that out before you came? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tYeah, no, that was the only thing that I had sorted  because everything else, like I cant find a job unless I would go in an interview, I can't find an apartment without going and seeing it, I cant set up a bank account until I go into the bank so Airbnb wass the only thing I can do from abroad where I like filter that down through super hosts and…I want to make sure that you know, the people Im staying with are good like that. So it's about like okay, maybe don't stay like, alone with a man, in a weird part of town you know, you know. So that was the only thing I had coming over. But it was really good to have someone coming over knowing that I had somewhere to be. At least it was like I'm going somewhere these people are expecting me to come here so it was kind of helpful.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd organizing like your kind of move, like your travel from the airport to home did', '', 'you do Uber or like things like that? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tSo I knew the directions from the metro. I knew that the place of staying was near a Metro. I was like that’s hand. But I did factor in the fact that I had a massive bag and two other bags with me, and I was just a tourist hanging. And so I had a few homeless people, like, like a few rough looking people come up and kind of chat with me, so then I was like, I'm just gonna take an uber for the rest of the trip. So I would recommend that, like you get to the airport and its straight into town, but I was like, yeah, ubers are much cheaper here so you just get an uber where you're going. Yeah they were great [uber and Airbnb] because it was so much cheaper like 250, for two weeks, two weeks, which is very good. I mean, like, I stayed at a really bad hotel that night when I saw the mouse. And that was like $60 $70 and if you do pay for two weeks of that, that's a lot more expensive but also it was horrible. So I'm like, it was like a one star hotel where it's like, at least at Airbnb, you have insider knowledge, people tell you stuff. Like they told me like, they set up my internet for me, they were really helpful. definitely would recommend that. Can I write this down like a travel section? And so I'm just going to come in here and then it was so Airbnb first. I Had a girl that lived here before. So she was… she went to college with me. She did same courses with me and then then moved here for two years. I remember seeing her pictures in Montreal so she sent me a document of that she sent to the guy who was taking over her job, but it was all like, what you need to know about living in Montreal. So she told me to look at the plateau which was great because I actually messaged her when I came here the first week. I only had 2 house viewings and I didn’t go to the first one because she told me not to because she was like, look, like you can go see it. She was like look its not the best street. Even the place that you live in is nice, your walk home isn’t going to be great. She was like a if youre living on your own, I just wouldnt recommend it. So I ended up just cancelling that and then I was like look I found somewhere else. So, I didn't go to that one. And then I got the viewing for the place that Im living now. And she was like, that is an amazing spot if you can get that in any way, take it. So, it was a huge help having her to be honest, to be honest. I mean, I could have ended up in first place and it could have been fine. But like, having someone who knows is so great. Like I'm from Ireland. I've been to Dublin. Like I know. I know things about living in Ireland. If you don't live in the city itself, if you don't know this exact area, if you don't do this street. I mean, you could take this is a great area, but this particular street isnt nice, you know, it's it's beneficial. Yeah. So having her like her insider knowledge was very valuable. I mean you could maybe find it online but then you would find like posts that were made in 2008. You know like, I don’t know if I could trust this stranger. But I knew this girl. I was like I knew, like, you know, to make sure we have similar ideas and stuff. So I was like, if she was advising it, you know, I, gonna trust her like, so it's Yeah, it was very helpful. I mean, like, you could, I suppose you need to know the area and its hard to like “ask where is good to live” coz everyone has their own opinion. So yeah, that was good. And what else? \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay. Yeah. All right. We were just gonna move. I mean, you actually kind of spoke about this person. Anyway, so I was going to move to social connections. Yeah. So you already told me about this particular person. But yeah, otherwise as well, friends, family, greater community, professional networks that helped you in your journey?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tSo okay, I'm gonna put her down. Yeah. So she was probably the first that I had any kind of, in Montreal. initially I think I messaged her like a year ago I was like thinking move here I'm thinking of moving said lot of places. Would you recommend anything? And she was like yeah move here. So Im gonna say friend from college and then I don't knowlike, now that Ive come here, I mean haven't had a huge… yeah like it was mainly just I talked to like other people that have lived in Canada so like other people… so yeah friend of mine from work she lived in Vancouver so and they were like this little group you have like this like people living outside of Ireland. So yeah,  And I can write the Facebook group here and then that website as well. The move to Canada one, they have forums and stuff if you wanna post any questions or whatever. And here I’ll write down bumble and meetups but haven't fully used them yet but I'm just gonna write in the future because when it starts to snow, and I get more alone… yeah\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tIn terms of technology, sorry, now that you're here, do you provide advice to anybody? Do you actually go on forums and say, or this is what you can do or…?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tI haven’t done that yet because I think when even like the odd questions you pop up in the likes of forum thing I'm like, I haven't done that yet. So, I can't advice but I probabl;y should. I mean, I did a Google review the other day and I never use google reviews and I remember talking to my brother about it and he's big for TripAdvisor. He uses it for everything like here. He came see me in Dublin for like a lunch. And he was like, Oh, I think this place is number one on TripAdvisor. I was like, all right. Like I live here, I know theres a few places that are good. But he was like, but this is on Tripadvisor so hes very like, he's very trusting of it. And then was like, all right, well do you post on it and he was like no and then I was like you should. And then I realized that I should because I use a lot of like I would use the internet live like best place to go for this.. like best bagels in Montreal. I use it a lot. So I probably should. I put like one google review the other day for a restaurants because I went with my friends and it was so cheap, and so nice. And staff are amazing. Like, you know, like I'd be really compelled to do it if I had a really good experience. if I had a bad one.I know I probably should left a bad one for that hotel that night. I was just worried that like the guys would know that it was me. Coz Id just left that day but it was aweful. But then I went on to booking.com and like all the reviews were pretty bad anyway, so so I was like I didn't stay here because it was it was good reviews. I stayed here because it was the cheapest and closest space in my house. Okay. But anyway, um, No, I haven't given any advice, but I If I saw someone like obviously asking questions or like if they were like, Oh, I don't know about this. I mean, somebody told me theyre coming to montreal from Ireland, I would definitely sit down with them for three hours. And I think I'm still learning. Its all new for me. And I'm kind of like, I don't know, like why you asking me it's like, when people come up from the street? And they're like, asking for directions are and so I'm like, I'm trying to even come up with the words to respond to them in French, let alone tell you. Where I don't know where I am. I don't know why people approach me because I clearly look lost. I'm looking at Google Maps and someone's like, do you know where this is? \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd this French, I mean, just the language, sort of play a part in how you navigate', '', \"the city or do you feel that's that's got anything to do with your experience of living here?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tIt has made like, I kind of like it, that I kind of like that theres a different language, and I don't know why. I find it I like the challenge if I like, I don't know, like when I came here first it was a bit of a shock that it was so widespread. And that's funny because Montreal people will tell you yet that the plateau and all these others  places there's so much English speaking there is so much English like 70% English and 30% French. I don't think that I think everyone speaks French so I think it's a bit of a shock when I get here first that, every when you hear in the background is speaking French and there was something nice about it though because it sounds like I'm here somewhere different, different culture, theres something new because like like I mean I can look at a sign and figure it out and like if you gave me a menu I can figure out most of things on it. It's like, it's nice to kind of feel like your brain has been trained to get into like work through stuff. Now I find it really hard to hold a conversation because even if I figure out exactly my word for oatmilk, I remember to request it, and then they ask me something in response and Im like… I don’t know. It is difficult, but when you learn a few words, and then you kind of make some effort to communicate someone it actually makes really good. So yeah, I actually like having it. And I would recommend those people like that they'd have had it in school. Say my friend that came she was at school with me. So she remembered few words and she was able to, like, do a few bits herself. I mean, if it was in German or in some other language like, I don't know if, like I was in China, I’d be fucked. I mean, it does help that I have some familiarity, but it's definitely a shock. Initially, when you realize oh, no, everyone does not speak in English. Just to hear it in the background, its even wierd, like speaking English. Even when I started my job was like, Oh, I can speak English. Okay, you know what I mean? And speaking with the flow as opposed to ummm.. could I … like trying to figure out stuff. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tThis may not apply to you but um any humanitarian or social support services that use like NGO or community service organizations or anything like that did that ever common?

No The only like, humanitarian like NGO like I mean I tried to like set up a volunteering when I came here first but that was for myself to volunteer. I tried to then they were like we will get back to you and yeah, and then because it was before I got the job, so I was kind of like, how can I lose time but then I was like, I don't know if you can Yeah, so I don't know, maybe in time ago nice now that I'm so good and no, I didn't I didn't use it. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tImmigration policy?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tAnd so, the main thing I'll say is that I think we're beyond lucky in Ireland because our passports like qualifies us to go so many places and it's I think we don't realize how easy we have it. Like even someone who went to Canada and we'll talk about at work work, like they qualify to come to Canada but it would like so much harder for them to try and work abroad and like we really move so freely across Europe and like, like, everyone I know. It's like the worsening now I know with Brexit and how that's all changed. But like people in Ireland are always like Im moving to Australia or im mving to Berline, always moving somewhere and you're going to work and apply and you just have to set up your papers, whatever. Even to move to Canada bit extra to do but still fairly straightforward. So a girl from India who I worked with in Dublin. She had such a nightmare. She had to apply for a new visa every year. There was a rule where she… she left Ireland for like 1 day or 2 days in something in this calendar year and if she didn’t, theyd take away her visa. It was just awful. So I was kinda like, Yeah, I don't know they do realise that you work here. So I think it's made me more interested. So it's made me really I know, it's hard because generally, people get into  policy or policies that affect them. So basically, you know, you'll always see people like fighting for cancer research because they're mum died of cance and they are angry and rightfully so and they want something. So it's different when…. I think it’s a big privilege when you got everything handed to you that you're kind of like, this doesn't affect me or is like, I don't know, it's hard because I'm kind of like I said it was the same it feels wrong for it to be easier for one person and harder for another. It feels wrong that people get put in cages in America and deported because they just want to live there. I mean, that's, I mean, that's like a whole other issue, that’s like, asylum and that's like people that actually need to live there. Not just someone like me who’s like “I would like to go to Canada”. I mean, it's so, the privilege we have is completely ridiculous. But yeah, it has made me more, if not involved in it, definitely more like aware of how, like when you hear about people like struggling with little kids, you're like, oh, like I can't believe that you have to worry about that when I don't you know, and it really makes you realize that privilege. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tI think we're kind of almost towards the end of it. I suppose I just want to ask you about the biggest challenges or obstacles that came your way in moving. Is there is there anything that you want to say on that?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tThe mouse. Yeah I can draw a little mouse. I’ll put the mouse because the mouse really affected me, and the health thing and the whole thing I mean, not being able to… like which hospital am I able to go to, what does my insurance cover? Whereas in Ireland it was just like, Ill just go to the nearest clinic. Its an added anxiety maybe. And the it's mainly the social aspect of it, it's not so much that I miss, like, and I miss not having my friends as well. Or that I really miss people that I love all my god, I miss them so much. I really want to see them, I don't have that so much. But it's little things, like habits that you have, and maybe it's an Irish thing of like the drinking culture that we have – its true [laughs] But like even like going for drinks after work on a Friday, like something like that, that I really miss that like it's mainly the weekends when you're…even last weekend and I'm like, I don't have this and it's like, whatever, everyone was like going home and like, have friends coming in. And Im like, I'm just gonna like, chill in my apartment. Do you know what I mean? Bit’s like that makes me feel a bit disconnected. Well, I mean, my friends have literally messaged and talked to me non-stop every day is almost like another job to try and keep up with all the correspondence like trying to get back to everyone. But it's Yeah, they've been very supportive. Yeah, that's the main challenges I mean, being on your own like yeah, I think it's just a big thing as well in that even if you enjoy it any kind of whatever it's different when it's so like say when you’re off over a weekend, there's always something to do when you're home, you have to go home, or meet someone for a coffee, like you to do all your social to do’s. And then when you the morning free to yourself for half a day and youre like yeah I need to go do something for myself myself. That's really nice when it's a choice, but when it's we don't have choice in it, It's doesn't it takes away some of the good from it. So like I'm like, yeah, it's very much enjoying going somewhere on my own. I very much enjoy spending the day by myself, but when you know, I mean, it's nice to still have the option that I might meet up with a person later. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tThey don't really have a culture of like going Friday night drinks?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tI think it really depends. I think it's really the place where we are so I'm literally in a warehouse in the middle of an industrial park. There's no… I think the closest hotel is like a 20 minute walk and there's no cafes nearby there's no shops nearby there. If you forget your lunch there is this like truck that goes by and I think that like, that’s your only option unless you have a car and you can drive to wherever. There's nowhere nearby. And like even when I was coming into the interview, I decided that I was gonna hate this place because I hate the look of industrial parks. You know like, when youre near and airport, you know what that looks like, its like urghh. So I think that's the main issue. We had like a team lunch the first week, you know, because I'm not the only new person who have which makes it a lot easier. And then they were kind of talking about doing like an Oktoberfest thing, and then maybe a drinking thing. And then before the Christmas party, so it feels like they will do social things. But I think it's more difficult to where we are. And they were kind of like, what we're going to go, you know, and then people were like, well, maybe we should just stay here in the office or drink here, because, you know, everyone is pulling from different areas. And they’re like its little warehouse, and if we drink here, you know, someone is going to get injured. And so it's kind of like, where do we go then? Because we need to get a Metro and a bus. It's mainly the location, I think. I mean, everyone there has been really nice, but I suppose it's the same as anywhere when you start somewhere new you're kind of like, I'm gonna be really nice and polite, but I don't know what your personality is. Yeah, I don't know if it's okay to do this, and alcohol just helps with that [laughs]. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd do you plan to maybe change your jobs in the future?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tNo, because a lot of jobs that I applied for, I didn't hear back from. And there was one that was like, super stressy. And they were like, can you do like 50 things to get up to the next stage. Before you will even be interviewed before you even have a chance to meet anyone. So, like I didn't want a high stress job. And this job is not stressful, I don't even think people are checking on me. It's like, amazing, like they're so positive and no one's kind of looking over their shoulder making sure you're doing the work. So I don't want a job that I'm going to be obsessed with or stay late at or, you know what I mean? So I think and because like, find a job and setting up and then get holidays or something like that because I need to take Christmas holidays, I need to take holidays in March, and then that would be six months. And then I'm like, well, what's the point of finding a new job I’m here for a year. I think I'm fairly sure I want to go and stay for the year, if that, if don't like it, I might go home sooner. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOh, really? Okay. So you don't select? I mean, I was gonna that would be my next question. Yeah. Next steps in terms of staying here. You just want to stay here for a year? \", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tI think so. Okay, you know, you never know what might happen. But yeah, like I could end up staying and making more friends find someone here, you never know. But fow now. No, I think I've always seen it as like a short term thing. I'm just here for I just want to be here for a while… I want to challenge myself to live on my own. I want to challenge myself to go somewhere completely new and completely different. Find a job like all these things, Like Im done with some of the hardest parts now. And now its just like adjusting. Like I don't know if this part is going to be the hardest because it's always different when your mind’s occupied it has so much to worry about. Like, oh I need to find my apartment, now I need to find a job, and my friends visiting but once they go and you know it starts to snow it's going to be a bit more like, okay, now you have to like, not only be okay living here, but try and enjoy it as well. I think quite keep it short term, like a year or maybe even less than a year, then I'll probably make the best out of this place. I think it's if I keep the short term, I'm really trying to value it and I'm like no, enjoy yourself. I mean, you're not going to have this next year you're going to be home and Dublin or go away and you want to be like I wish I was on my own again. So I'm kind of like trying to be you know, trying to enjoy it as much as I can.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd I was just wondering also your any aspect of romantic relationships. That sort of does that any is does that say the role anywhere? Is that a motivation at all?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tSo before I moved to here, so I was in a long term relationship for about six years, and that ended badly. So that was I think summer 2018. I think initially, your initial thing is like, I gotta move out, I gotta do something. I gotta cut my hair. I gotta go.. And then I was like, No actually gonna keep going and like, cuz I wanted to eave my job in summer 2018. And I was going to move to go away with him. And that was the whole plan. So then I was like, Okay, this big thing just happened. I don't want to change something else big in my life. You know, you've got your base, who youre with and your job. So I was like I'm going to say my job for maybe another year, and then I'll do and then I'll figure out something else. So I think that was partly why you wanted to Do something different, but I will say, That's why I came here because I don't like because many people have asked me like, did you move because of the’bad breakup? And Im like Well, no, I didn't mean to get away from anyone.. I didn't move to, like escape or whatever, because it was like, I always want to travel. I knew when I started, that he didn't. And I knew that would be kind of part of my life that I wouldn’t ger to do enough. I was kind of content. I don't think I felt that I was missing out on anything at the time for, I think it was all like, I mean, he knew that too, like many people do, My parents used to say it. They were like, oh, D, S are abroad. But you know, we always thought to be Sarah, you know, everything. And I was like, Yeah, okay, whatever. So it was always something that I knew that I wanted, and then eventually when the opportunity presented itself was like, so yeah, so I think that's why I gave myself a bit of extra time to kind of, coz obviously a breakup is hard, it's almost like I don't want to do this as kind of a reactionary thing. And then by Christmas and I was like all right yeah, I'm feeling good, Still though, I’d like to be single for a little while. Obviously when I have the long term or the short term idea in my head like that I'm not going to be living here for years and years. I mean it may be if I was in Ireland it might be different for I mean, I'm not definitely not actively seeking a relationship nor would I I mean, again never say never. I mean my parents were like you could me meeting someone in Montreal and stay there for 10 years. But I'm not really romantic like that. I still think I need a lot more time. I had a great year but being in a bad thing like that is hard. When you kind of get out, initially you’re upset but now I'm like, I'm actually really enjoying everyon,  I really like, you know, I like the fact that I'm here. I've never been here. I've never gotten this opportunity. So, it's kind of like it's all for the greater good. Yes, it has made me be a bit more like no to that. So yeah, maybe in a year.\", '', ' ', '', \"M:\\tI just kind of want to get your thoughts on what you feel about it. Is there anything else that you'd like to add to it?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tI think that's fairly comprehensive. And I'm really glad I came here. I think I made the right decision but then again, I think I'm that kind of person any way that I'm like, always be like, like, I never think that was the wrong decision. I'm not huge, like, everything will look like everything is predestined. And it's meant to be and I don't believe that, but I'm still kind of like it was the right decision at the time and if I choose to leave, that would be the right decision. And if I choose to stay for two years and then apply for another visa, that would be the right decision. So im kinda like, I'm really happy I came here, and Montreal particularly It's just like I love it here. Yeah, like I think yeah, it makes you realize what things are really valuable like, like missing friends and family is hard, but also it's kind of like oh, it's really nice to look forward seeing them and to really like value it like means I'm, I can't wait to go home for Christmas but I'm also not we counting my time here. It will be really nice to see them. But it'll be nice to be here too. So, yeah, I think it's good. I'm really glad I did it. I think if I had this I would have heard this. I think it makes you realise so much about yourself and other people when youre on your own. Like, it is harder but it is also such a great learning experience and you learn so much about yourself.M:\\tSo we'll just start with When did you first arrive to Canada? \", '', '', '', \"Si:\\t10th of October so we're just 2019. So that's very recent. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what were the motivations behind your move?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tI wanted to learn a new technology.

I'm doing to specialization in big data. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd this is where back this isn't in your India you're studying in India prior to this?\", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tI have a work experience of 10 years into data handling so Im abusiness intelligence consultant and worked on this domain for eight to nine years, right. I worked as a trainer as well as consultant. So from last two, three to four there is a lot of hype regarding huge data is getting accumulated. And there should be ways in which how you're going to handle the data. When I talk about business intelligence, it is all about whatever data which you have, and the previous data, how the previous data can be used. So, this particular business intelligence model, it only helps us to predict how to work with previous data. But what about the data currently, which we have and how we will predict the future of the data? So that is what is your data science and big data technology. So I was keen into learning the next level as a having them of experience. So I want to evolve from one profile to another. So I'm over here to learn Big Data.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat was the sort of factors that made the decision of coming to Canada like what else were you thinking of? Couldn’t you study in India?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tWhen I think about countries outside like when I think about other countries than India, I'm into this technology space so I know what are the roles available in India for this particular technology. We are we don't have that much projects. Even if I join any any organization and work on onto this technology, I will be considered as a beginner beginner in the sense like I won't be getting profiles or I won't be I won't be getting directly to work on data. I'll be doing some documentation parts so I won't have an appropriate to work like as per my knowledge or As for my the technology, which is which is there in the industry right now. So countries like US, Canada and North America and US and all all these countries, they have advanced technologies, and they are already working in this space. So even though I'm learning big data so Canada, must be the technology space or the education space in Canada must have been ahead. It is talking about artificial intelligence and it's talking about emotional intelligence as of now. After big data there is artificial intelligence than there is now people are talking about emotional intelligence whereas in my country there is nothing no concept called as emotional intelligence. Till now, so, emotional intelligence is spoken by only a psychologist and people are related to medicine field, but not not this medicine plus technology is not it is not at all like, integrated as of now. So, I wanted to study abroad and I selected Canada\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAre there other countries that you considered?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tI found the process visa process for Canada easy. And, I selected Montreal as my friends have already done the course from this college so I had… I knew the feedback of this college I knew the feedback about the feedback in the sense…the living… and living conditions in Montreal. So it is always better if you have some people around in that same city and they're telling the guide you that these are the things you need to do in six months, one year, two years. So if I have a Guided approach. I was considering Toronto but there it was 2 years, 3 years of study and I’ve already done engineering. I've already done like 10 years of work experience into education industry only. So I have like lot ot… my profile also study and teach, study and work. And also I wanted to study much. So I just wanted one year of a specialization and then get into my space, like the technology space, how it works out and all that. I’ve seen Toronto but there was no 1 year course and as for my expense and budget, it was not that suitable for me. So, I selected Montreal. I gave a thought about studying in the same thing in 2019 Jan and I was about. So I just thought my friend friend told me that there is there are the admissions happening for June 2019 intake. So I just applied, I gave my prerequisites all the prerequisites… I gave my English test. So by March, March, and my academics, everything was done. I send the application and I got a letter of application by April end so I was supposed to come in June, but since I have been I was working and I do wind up that process. So I couldn't join in June. So I had to come here in the October intake. Like what Im thinking…. what is my mindset now… I've got an opportunity to learn and advance specialization. So I will be more keen into this technology related to data gathering and data handling. So, I'm going to just see what are the options that are available after studies after one year so at that time I will consider as well as per the requirement and all that what all countries I can travel to and work in from working based. So when I was doing your research about Montreal, and also there are many universities offering this. So, I might go into the Masters in the same space. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay.

Things went in place. The proper flow happened. The factor is, though, the course which I will be joining, I will pretty much knew that I wanted to do, whatever work experience I have, I want to go to the next level. So, for the next level, I need to be skilled. So if Montreal did not have the college or this course, I would have opted for another, like another city, also Toronto. So I would have taken a two year or three year course. But luckily I got the same course for one year over here.

And it has specialization in big data. Okay, so this course has two specializations. One is big data and another one is business intelligence. So, I already have 10 years of work experience in business intelligence. So, I selected big data.', '', '', '', 'ML\\tSo was there a test that you had to pass for this course or was it really represents the prerequisites?', '', '', '', 'Si:\\tThe prerequisite was relevant work experience and since I had enough working…like more than required work experience so easily I got the offer letter.

And my fees is being handled by my family. So half of the fees will be sponsored by them, and half of the fees, I have paid it. So sponsoring is… is like a backup. So in case if I'm not able to get a part time job and all and I'm not able to manage my expenses then my family will come into play. I'm looking for part time work over here. Into the same skillset… like I have training experience so there are a lot of colleges over here, lots of universities over here, and if they'll allow part time work, I can work as an instructor. If it is something related to technology courses, I can work in a lab assistant. So depends what type of requirements they have in case if they have it and if the allow part time. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo in terms of your family, like can you tell me a little bit about your family like what was their reaction to your decision to move?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tThey wanted me to move. My my mother, she's a retired professional professional in the sense, she was a principal in one of the school. My father… My father was a working In the government, he’s a government servant. My parents both were working.. Now they're retired. I have two younger brothers who both are into IT and the other one is into CA. So, like my family is a working family and, like, educated family. So, even though I'm I'm 33 right now and single, they allowed me to take my own decision and they said and it is your choice - you decide. If you want to be independent, go and live your life, do whatever you want. There was no pressure at all to get married and all. There was no pressure at all since, since if I talk about my mom… after getting married. At that time, she had just completed her graduation. After she got married, and after five days, she went for higher studies. My father and my father family allowed her to go do her higher studies. So two years she was away from her family. [Laughs] And she is the first person at my in my native to be a teacher. Like 30- 35 years back. So, we belong to a Maharashtrian community. I come from Mumbai so Mumbai is a part of Maharashtra and I come from a Maharashtrian community where we have mainly farming and so even in my native place, there are very few people who are educated and from my native theyve come to Mumbai. So, My father has come to like 35 or 40 years back. So, there were like 10 to 12 people... mainly guys only who moved from that city and they came to Mumbai, and then they started working and. The native city is Sangli. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo in terms of friends, so family, you told me friends and community so did you have any friends here prior to you How did they help?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tI have like, two of my best friends, school friends. They moved to Toronto, two years back. So but they didn't have any idea related to educational institute and how… what is the process and all but my friends, friend … a colleague, since she is working in Toronto, so she had, she had this particular friend. He studied in the same college, he completed his course and now he has moved to Toronto for work. So she told him that my friend is looking for some study opportunities in Canada so can you help her out? She's into the technical field and all and he said that why don't you consider this particular college since you don't…if  you don't want a long term studies. You want a one year course only. So this college offers one year course. So ask her to go to through the website and check it out. So she told me.. On 5th of Jan she told me about this. I checked the website and all.  She spoke to me in the morning around 10 to 11 o'clock. I just surf the website I spoke with my parents and they were like go ahead. So, in one and a half hour I decided which course I want to get into. I spoke with the college, like I wrote a mail to the college stating this all I'm interested into. Is there any  seat available. So the college sent me a list like you have to go through this particular process, then only you will get an offer letter and so by March end and I completed the requirement like giving the English test and gathering my documents and paying the registration fees and all. So the moment I got my IELTS result.. I got it in first week of March. Though I decided in one and a half hour about the college, but I took time to first understand the city, what are the different options regarding the same course, what other colleges are there. So I didn't find those that are… like there are colleges like McGill university, it is very much famous in history. But again, it didn't offer one year course. So it was offering a master course, two years, of course, and one year of work. So I spoke with my parents said, you already have a engineering degree. And you already have 10 years of work. And it depends upon you if you're selecting a 2 year course. And then again, one year of work experience, so my mom compared it with her experiences. After marriage, she did 2 years of studies and then she worked. So she told me what are the problems she faced, when you were studying and you are already married? And in my case, I was not married, I'm not married. So she said what are the problems, What are the things you will face so you decide whether you want to take a one year of studies, like a gap, one year full of concentration on studies. And then you decide to take your life ahead - marriage, ofr work which city, what you want to do and all instead of spending three years on education and then deciding. So, by the time you will be 38-39. So, what will be the life ahead? One year is fair enough for me to explore the city to understand myself and see how I take my life ahead.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tYeah.

So, the technology is so, what do you say, it is helpful you just download google translate into you know, French dictionary and you come to know what it is exactly. But what I feel is if you are migrating from one place to another place, you should be adaptable to that particular place. So, I should have done a French course earlier… I should have done it, at least the basic so that by communicating... I would be able to communicate with people or when I when my roommates and they're applying for a job. So, they are also like technical people. So, when they are going for some job opportunities, they go they do the interviews also and then in the end they come to know that they need bilingual people. Which is also pretty much perfect. Why? Because if they are working for a, working as a customer sales representative and if the client is speaking in French, and if they're not able to handle their query, so then what is the point? So they need to be equipped with the language also. So that is a problem which they are also facing so that the government is providing French education.

So I'll be doing if I'm considering for PR, I need Canadian work experience and Canadian study experience. So, to bring the score up. Yeah.

And so, over over there I understood what is the exact need of like, imparting technologies like what will be the use of technology. When you're working into the industry, you're working for another client, those are also technology driven. But the NGOs, they are not that much as par with the technology. So, they are into like basic, below basic level you can say. So, these are the people these are these are the sectors which needs to be, what you say, brought up. So, luckily I worked for 2 NGOs. Then this particular opportunity came up. So then I said that you have given enough time for the NGOs. And now let's consider, let's go to the next level, move from one place to another place, then let's, let's explore life. So, 10 years of, you can say, machine life, then one and a half year of new new life in the sense …into an environment which is not technology driven, social life, social life. So, over there also I faced problems in the sense that there were people who were not that much technology driven so they need to be explained and then then they were supposed to understand each and everything. So again, it was it was difficult. It was stressful because for them to know, the scrums and all, that is all new but for us we are used to it. When you're working we are used to it and then we get irritated, like “why I have to explain you each and everything again and again”. But for them it is new. So, I found those kind of problems over here, but then I learned patience. Actually, I have learned patience. Like how to understand how to explain a layman. What all things you're doing day in and out. So, I thought the same thing I tried with my family. I thought first I started explaining things to my dad. This is how my life has been for whatever new thing I have to get into, my family was like lets first explore, first understand it so that when you when you step out in the world you know that you will know what are the things, what are the problems that you will have so let's discuss in the family. Yeah so luckily I have that kind of family. My parents are they know what are the future things like what are the future problems my child will face so they used to prepare us in that way so from school colleges and all. In school also like while going to the college This is how the world is already in the most to travel, these are all the things you need to do on your own. So they started preparing us two years prior only and then they told us now go and step into the world. So they're [parents] calling every 15 minutes. So for them, they also sleep as per Canada time. Theyre worried. But now that they're like… before coming here I spoke to them and they were like “very good, go out and speak and meet people and understand them”. And let's see. For the, it is always like they should be, they should be aware of what she is doing and whatnot. And for me, it is like, for the first time was like an independent life. Though there were no restrictions. But always I knew that if I'm stuck, I have my brother. I have my mom and dad to help me. But now since you said that you share the Google Map and I will not know how to understand it and all. And so then I thought of connecting with my brother because what is that you did? But I landed over here. Like in Mumbai, we are used to Uber. So I was just looking at the options but then I realized that I don't have the data pack. I don't have the internet and so I just did my roaming. On roaming, so he just called me and he said what? I don't know. I will just wait and I will let me understand it. Then he texted me that these are all the steps are supposed to do and this is how I landed to this place.  So at times also when when I'm in the room, there it India also it would pretty much be the 5 of them so mostly speaking to them only. I have less friends. So you're also sometimes like sometimes like ….most of the time I feel lonely, like no one to talk to. But then through whatsapp and facebook, theyre connected to me. So ideally what they will do they will record a message…they will record a video and they will send me, like “what you're doing and all so that I don't feel lonely that I would feel that yes Okay. So in a night It's morning over there over there so I'll keep on doing those videos so that I don't feel homesick. So it is like when you have a conversation, a telephonic conversation so that during that part when you have those people contact. But they decided this idea of having a video recording, the video every now and then. So even after the conversation is done like after one hour or two hours you feel lonely again, just go and see the video. So, you feel that he is he is there in front you.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tso first, tell me about the visa categories that you were considering at the time of your move. Now, in your case, it was very straightforward, right? So basically, what you want to put there now is your visa status, including how long it took to wait for the visa. Visa processing time so so for example, you may start from January where you started planning it and how long did it take to get the visa..', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tSo Jan 2019 I came to know about the option, the study option. So that same time I thought of considering the work option, like work visa, if I could get a work visa since I have the relevant experience and about PR, PR option as well. So work option, not possible from the home country. I didn't apply. I have friends working over here and they said that you need a Canadian experience and then only you can get an opportunity over here. And so I didn't give a thought about it. So not possible from home country without local work experience. And PR – current score – so mainly age factor – then I had the marital status. So when youre married you get your partner's points, like primary applicant and secondary applicant and the scores can be added up. So because of these two factors, otherwise the rest of the factors were good. But these 2 factors affected my score. Then I considered studies. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd tell me I mean, I think this goes into the next question pretty much. So what did you do for your study? So I know that you said that you didn't hire any agents or consultants, but anything that you paid for. So think about document translation, IELTS, medical, any process that you have to do that you have to pay for commercial.\", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tNothing. I didn’t pay for anything. The website is very much clear. They mentioned what all you have to do. So, I didn’t pay for anything. Neither for my visa process also. I just applied for the IELTS, there are a lot of materials available on internet, A lot of forums which you can print out. Okay for the exam I had done the payment, but not for the training. People are paying for the training. The visa fees I paid, the medical test fees I had paid. So for the study option I need to get my transcript. I got the transcript in 2 weeks so in Jan itself I got my transcript. Then I did my IELTS registration so the fees I paid. This happened in Feb 2019. I got my result in... I cleared my IELTS exam. This happened in March 2019.  Then I submitted all the documents…submitted relevant documents I will write…to the college April 2019. And I got my letter of acceptance…acceptance I got in April itself. So after I got my letter of acceptance, then the college had mentioned those steps that I need to follow after getting acceptances I need to take permission from Quebec so there is one documentation, CAQ certificate you need to get. Quebec province says that if you want to come to our province, then you need to have a permission. So, you need to have the certificate. So I applied for the certificate and in total four weeks to be processed and then I got the acceptance. This was like $5000 or $6000 rupees. So it’s the ministry of Quebec. We need to write that we are intending to come to the province for studies since this is a French speaking province in the country so – rest all the provinces, they are majorly English speaking. This is the only province which has the French as the major language. So they need from like, they asked people the permission. So then they gave me the permission saying that yes, you are allowed for studies. So I had to do the CAQ… applied in April in 2019. I got a reply that was positive. I got it in May 2019. After that I was asked to pay fees and then the security funds. GIC loan. Paid half or 6 months tuition fees. That I did in May itself, May 2019. Paid my GIC amount. This is an investment certificate which we need to as a student you're supposed to do. Well you're saying that this is the fund which I have. So in case, its kind of security fund which you are putting in, so that in case is in the future if you don’t have any funding, you don't rely on government for funding because government provides facilities to PR to their citizens also. But we are coming from outside countries as students so they cannot accommodate us to have any support. So this is $10000. It is self funded. So there are Scotiabank and there are some other banks also. One other bank has started it otherwise before it was Scotiabank only. So $10,000 which we are paying, every month the government gives us back. So, this is divided into 12 months. So government gives you back so that you can bear your expenses and everything. It's not like you’re relying on the government. Like youre not homeless, you don’t have anything to do and all. The government has decided that youre coming to the country, you’re coming for your studies, you pay the security funds and then utilise that when you’re staying here. So it took one month to get my certificate and all. So after May, one month I took a break because I had everything, I just had to apply for my visa. For my visa I had all the documents and all, so I took a break, I went to see all Maharashtra. So I explored the different cities in Maharashtra. It was awesome. I never knew in my life that there was all these cities. I went to Aurangabad, and Sherdi religious place and I explored Pune with my family. It was a family holiday. Then my native place also, Sangli. Then met all my relatives at all before moving out of the country. So I met everyone. Then I applied for the visa in July… and receive visa in July itself. I applied on the 3rd of July. I got it in three weeks.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo we'll move on from those questions. Now. We'll ask you. I want to know I mean, it's somewhere here. You would have done a medical test as though right?\", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tYeah. medical test. I did it. Umm so last week of May I did my medical test. Like two or three days prior to my appointment was on third of July. So it takes only one day for the medical. That's a half day. So I did it on 27th or 28th of May.  So here also theres something called the biometrics which we have to do. That was done on the same day, when we apply for the visa through VFS. So I applied it offline. So I had an offline process. So then I came under this non-SDS category. This is for working professionals. It's like there are two things SDS and non SDS. There are students who complete their higher studies – like 12th standard or graduation. Those who don't have gap any gap between their studies, they they come under SDS and those people who have a gap after studies they have one year of experience two years of experience, they will come under non SDS. So, this is suitable for people like working professionals. This is the student direct stream. So you have a certain level of education and then afterwards you're coming for a masters or a PhD. So you have done your masters in your country and then the next one, you are coming over here so you don’t have any work experience. So non SDS is for working professionals or those who have a gap. Since I did offline, so I had to do my biometrics. Same Day and submit my files. This I did from from VFS global. it is easier for the for the visa team to process. So when you say non SDS, they will ask for work experience documents. So, it is like the the form… the form which is created. Here you need to show gap letter. If you have a gap after your studies, so the gap can be working or else relevant clarification. So those who are working, they will show their work experience like joining letter, leaving letter and all. I showed my work experience because I was working till June. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo let's just work on these maps. Now you pretty much will be basically keep adding information in the same map, because now the questions are about these processes in a little bit more detail. So in terms of let's talk about technology. So how has technology supported your migration from the initial stage till now? Technology meaning, conduct online research, what resources or websites used, social media that you used, and current social media that you use in your journey now as well even to maybe stay connected with your family, for example, or maps or things like that. \", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tSo basically I used Google website, college website, CIC website. So source is nothing but Google. So basically CIC website is good enough. What I found if you go into the forums there are multiple people who will put their questions. So you will find lot of discrepancy because their experiences and your experiences, there is a lot of difference. So instead of getting confused, you go to the CIC website and then and you have they have a questionnaire and answers provided. So you can do that. CIC website. For transcript, I connected with my college, my college website to understand how I will get the transcript and all. This I got from British Council. I gave an offline exam so it took 14 days for my result to come.  So I submitted my documents. My college had sent me the link.. so here they have a Google form. They have that drive Google Drive on that you are supposed to submit the documents. CAQ also I was supposed to create an account on the website…on the government website. Plus, they mail you the letter. Post the letter.  So you have a physical copy. So what happens when they send you an electronic copy it can be editable. Here it is a certificate. So the certificate can be mishandled it can be edited and all. So they send a physical copy. So this copy is required at the airport, it is required at the immigration and all. When I landed, I have to show it at the airport then I was directed to the immigration section, because this is the permission. I used Facebook for understanding the city – city knowledge. Lot of information I got from Facebook for instance it is a historical place, regarding the weather, what are the different places in Montreal, how is the weather, how to cope up with the weather. They have videos which have been posted. There are hashtags. I use Facebook, Instagram, I follow the mtl blog. Im following the account of my college so I was pretty much updated about things happening other activities are happening in my college. I came here on 9th of  October so 1st of October they had a visit the college whichever student they had for June intake and all.. They took those students for a city tour so I got to learn about all this activities, extracurricular activities, colleges networking activities, that I came to know from their Instagram handle. So college and MTL blog – these are the 2 things that I am following. Plus I'm very much into yoga. So the people who are in this city who does Yoga and all, Im following their accounts and then this one thing I follow – Sri Ravi Shakankar – Art of living. This is one Instagram handle. So what they do they conduct a meditation and yoga session. twice in a week, like bi-weekly. This coming Sunday they have a session. So FB and Instagram is more than enough. WhatsApp – video and voice call. So instead of using Skype and all Whatsapp is really good because for Skype the other person needs to have it and all. With Whatsapp your phone is registered and off you go. You have Google Maps very much essential when you are traveling to other country and the city, the country from where you come, you have good transportation facility like train, you have cab you have rickshaws available. But it is not necessarily these facilities will be available in the other country. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay? All right, let's talk about social connections on the map. So now like I said, you just build upon this same map. \", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tSo this is self-funding then sponsored by dad. That’s it. Since he’s retired, he has his retirement fund so that is being utilised. Yeah lot of, umm, when I thought of studies like when I confirm with studies, I wanted to know the culture… like how is the technological culture in the city. So I enrolled to meetup. Yeah, went to this app …meetup app. On that I connected with Montreal Analytics team. Then I connected with women in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This is one community which is doing good work. We're working on this. So, these are the apps that keep on posting the meetups that they conduct. So these are the 2 groups. This is an NGO. So, when I'm when I'm in the city, and I don't have things to do on weekends, or whatever, I need to meet with people, I need to understand the culture I need to understand the technology space. So I'll be going to these meetups and I will be interacting with the people. Oh, that's this is that because Did you go to any meetups yet? Not as of now. I have like I said yoga. Yeah, art of living. So that is happening on Sunday 20th 20th of October. So I'll be going over there. But it also helped me to find out the relevant accommodations and all. Ill be meeting people who are already in Montreal. Students who are already in Montreal. They might help me out. For accommodation, what I have observed over here…whichever buildings are there, so they have already posted if there are vacant flats that are available in that building. So the posters are already available, you just scan the code and physical posters are there, you just scan the code and it redirects you to that website and you come to know if there are rooms available in this. You just connect with them or fill the form and then accordingly, they will reply. So maybe QR code will come somewhere and at the end here, looking for accommodation. So this is all before arrival. Now I can create a map after arrival. So for arrival I will start with airport. So at airport what was required is a token needed to be created that is a profile is created yeah profile of passengers are created. Then the next your CAQ is checked. Your visa is checked. You are redirected to Immigration Department. And then you get your visa permit, here you get your visa – after the immigration. You don't get a visa until you actually arrive. The work permit is after studies. The college mentions that since you are studying over here you can work part time so that is implicit. 20 hours a week. VFS just provided with the visa…visa number. See that is just a number. So, when you come to their country and whatever number you have, based on that number the immigration team understands that these are students, these for study, these are for work, these are for PR. Then they give you the documents. So I got a stamp saying student. So I got my study permit and I was out… out of the airport [laughs]. So very much clear process and staff is very cordial. You need to create your own profile. So there are 15 to 20 computers available. You can do it in five to seven minutes your token is created you after that you have two people who will be checking your certificate, the check it, they tell you to go to the immigration and immigration section there are seven to eight people desks, so even if there are 20 people, each persons check is done in 5 minutes. This is very good over here. They do ask… the immigration people do ask what is your accommodation? Where are you going to stay? Where are you going to go from here? So that is being checked – accommodation and address is checked. We call it as reference. So yeah this would go before. Submitted my file. Visa was approved in July. It takes 2 days to come from Delhi to Mumbai. So, after that I connected with my friends for temporary accommodation. So, I had two months – August, September. So it happened that earlier I was supposed to go to another place and there, there was no vacancy. And in September's first week, it was already occupied. So, then I had to search for another place. So eventually this is the 3rd friends room where I have a like, they accommodated me. 2 months it took me, like I was I was in a dicey position, like where I will stay, where I will stay.. Firstly I was searching for accommodation on Facebook, Kijiji app, Airbnb and all. But eventually I got it through a friend. Accommodation and then I got a cab, Because the address was already given to me. And from airport, this location, it takes 20 minutes. And then they came to receive me near the entrance of the building. Everything is on your mobile phone. Just imagine if you don’t have an internet connection, you are gone. I did my international roaming but I didn’t use the data services. So I did that now, like I got my college registration done, my bank accounts, Then I've got my phone, took another SIM card here and I hot my social insurance number also. I went first I went to the College. So, what I did, in one day itself I did everything - services. So, I had my college registration, in that same building, so college registration is on the first floor, Scotiabank at ground floor. Then there is mall over here. Eaton Mall.. there I took my SIM card, so which is like five minutes away – Sim card - and then I went to Service Canada for my sin number. So this all happened in a span of three hours. So that is the beauty of government working over your. Actually, this is on do in your country. In 2-3 hours, you cant do it. You need three days and all these places are very much nearby. Otherwise in my in my country or my city I need to travel from one place to another place. So, traveling is like 30 minutes, one hour, two hours. \", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHave you looked at immigration policies in general? Do you keep it? Do you keep check on it? And what do you think about immigration policies in Canada?', '', '', '', 'Si:\\tIt is, it is pretty much clear that this immigration…like permanent immigration can happen provided whatever is the score at that time…after two years, or after one year of studies. What is the immigration status, so it all depends upon that time, but I know the basic basic thing that I know if I want to immigrate to Canada, there are certain things, rules in the sense.. So age factor, marital status, your Canadian studies, Canadian work experience, So after completing my studies, if I if I fit into the age factor, if I fit into the marital status so that point is going to be constant. My Canadian work experience might add some points my Canadian studies will add some points. And if I get a score, and that score is as par with the CRS score, So I can get PR. It all depends upon future. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tRelationships?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tMoving to another country and as a single person, it is very obvious you would like to interact with people, you would like to get into a relationship, but it all depends upon how it happens. And since there's a new country, new place, basically Montreal – this is like a French speaking province, so there will be a language barrier. So I don't know how it will happen.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tWould you have to marry an Indian person only doesn't matter where you?\", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tIt doesn’t matter and it didn't matter when I was in my country also. In fact it would be very good if I didn’t marry an Indian person [laughs]. Because when you are thinking of settling,  you have already taken a decision of moving from one country to another country. So your mindset is about exploring the places, so why not exploring relationships and why not exploring this aspect of your personal life also? Like, in my case, 33 half of my life I've spent in one country and didn’t do this… I was in a relationship and things couldn’t work out. So I couldn't take our decision to get married. So now, now, my mindset is here I have like, I don't have a burden of working. It is pretty much clear that I'm studying I have, so I will be having some time on the weekends. So it all depends upon my study schedule and how it is, I need to have, like, I have to say, in my bucket list, I have made sure that I'm going to go out and meet people, which I have not done in my work life, like for 10 years, or employed so that I have to do it over here, because what I feel is this is the one year which I've got. I've got it from my family as well as the opportunity I've got to understand myself and take a step on it. Tinder I have used in my country. It is of no use and the app has a very negative response and all. I don't know about other apps. On Facebook, you guys come to mobile lot of apps and all like, okay, okay. Okay. See the love that you have. But I don't want to rely on those apps. What I feel is if you start socializing, you start meeting new people like I have an opportunity to. I can meet someone in my college also. And I'm like, I'm a big fan of Shahrukh Khan. So I will tell you one experience Yeah. So like from I'm a die hard fan Shahrukh Khan. So before coming on the last day for my friend's birthday, they prepared one slam book. So the last page was Shahrukhs pic and my pic. So they had written a message that hope hopefully you will, you will meet him some day. So what happened when I went when I went to my college for registration, my college is at the first floor. So there was one guy. I just entered the lift so there was myself and two guys who live. So one of the guy he spoke to another guy, he said… he was greeting him hello. So the other guy told him Do you know me? He said yes, we met at Apple. So then he introduced himself, “I'm Shahrukh” [laughs]. So when he introduced himself he said “Im Shahrukh and Im from Pakistan”. And Im like Shahrukh!!! [Laughs]. After 10 minutes I just messaged my friend I said that you wrote in the slam book that I will meet Shahrukh and I met Shahrukh in my college. So you know Bollywood movies? So Shahrukh’s last movie was jab Harry Met Sejal. So in that, the tagline and what you seek is seeking you. [laughs] So, my friends, everyday they message me and say – did you meet Shahrukh? I am like, no I haven’t gone to the college again but I'm very much eager. So what happened after the lift… I went to my college and did all the process. Then I have one of my student is working over here. So he told me that why don’t you come to McDonalds? So, I went to McDonalds and Shahrukh had come to McDonalds as well. So I was telling my friends that you’ve written in my slam book and I have met Shahrukh. It is not Shahrukh Khan but it is Shahrukh. I am following him… not following him, like seeing him but he doesn’t know that this girl is looking at me.  So that gives me a high point over there okay fine. I can look around people and I can meet people and people oh you're a very positive, very cordial…like they speak… they are very friendly. Even at stores, I went to all the government offices and the life was very easy. Otherwise when you go to a government office in your country, first of all you feel scared then the second thing is you’re already scared, and then people don't talk properly. They talk rudely. And also First of all you’re scared, you're not that ready you take elder person from your family to go to the government office and then your attitude and their attitude dont match. So it's your family members always say that whenever you're going to a government office make sure you're taking an elder person who has very good high level of patience because its a government office. If you speak rudely and if you speak with your attitude, the work is not going to happen. So take someone who is elder and who has very good level of patience. That thing I didn’t observe over here. It was a good thing and I was little bit sceptical.. if they ask some questions that I'm not able to answer or it might happen I might get hyper and all. Even my family was amazed that in three hours you did all these things and that too being alone. Im like yes, I did it. [laughs]. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay I supposed to mean I'm look I'm done in terms of like the only thing I think I want to ask about now is whether your family will also come here at some point to visit you or to see you if, if and what your future plans are in general like what you would not like to do next next steps.\", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tMy family – I don’t think so they would be coming over here because my stay is, as of now, it all depends on my year one year of completion. Then again there will be an approval for the work permit. I have go through an approval process. So as of now I don't know, in my mind is only studies study like the one year of studies. Then our next I don't know like, if I'm calling my family what is the process and all …I suppose it is visit visa now. But again, again, there are some there must be some prerequisites for visitor visa and all. I have not given any thought about it and my family's also not thought about it. So that would be in future if I get a work permit again. What are the criteria for family coming to the country and all? No idea. \", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, looking at your map, how do you feel about it? Is there anything that you want to add to it?

So, they had their visa rejection also happened and all. So in my case, what I observed is they, they were not having that much knowledge. So, luckily, in my case what I did before applying even everything, I made sure that I have 75% of the knowledge regarding what I'm doing next. So, even I was thinking that 25% I might go wrong, but 75% I have a knowledge about this. This also.. the government work and all… I made sure that I read proper content and then I went to them, again French people in the offices, there were talking in French. So, I made sure that how to greet them in French. I made sure those I know those words their accent I need to understand and all what I observed when I went to Service Canada My name they pronounced in another way. Even there were people sitting so the pronunciation of the name was very much different so there were some two three people the name was called several times but they couldn’t understand that their name is being called. So its all like how adaptable you are  and how you're prepared… t\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat has been the biggest challenge?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tThe biggest challenge observed was in Frankfurt – in my layover. So my flight was delayed from Mumbai. So, I had a span of like 30 minutes to move from that, that section to my boarding session, so I had to run like anything. So I thought that Oh my God, if I missed this flight, what was going to happen? I didn't knew what what would be the next options and all and the funds are not there. So even in your country, if you could happen that you miss a train, a flight or a bus, you know that you have funds, you will do something about it. And no internet or no internet connection. And the mind was also not working like what am I going to do. Like, I met a guy. He helped me because he was also moving to that same gate. So he helped me. He helped me a lot into that. We both were running and all and like in 20 minutes I reached there. Even the airport staff, they were good. But they also couldn’t do anything because I had to run anyhow, I had to rush. That was the biggest challenge. Because at that time even thinking now is like if I couldn't make it in in that 30 minutes then what next. Those 30 minutes were like, something… Then when I was sitting in the flight I was thinking, what if I missed it. When I came over here and shared this with my family and my brother was like there is no problem. You are supposed to go to the airport authority the whichever like I came from, I took Lufthansa, So just go to their section. So then they will book another flight or they would have contacted India or they would have… like something could have been done. I was like this option, at that point, I wouldn't think of. And this was the first international flight so I never knew that this all options are there. So its good that I am moving out and when other members of my family will move, they are well equipped with all this possibilities. They also helped me a lot. And I'm like lucky that they knew that these all possibilities would come. So they were prepared with this and we were doing it because they also connected with their friends and they did the research and all. I was very much relying on my family that yes, if nothing could happen, yes, they are there they will help me anyhow and they will do it.\", '', '', '', '[this process of your move has become your family’s process] ', '', '', '', \"So I tell my friends that I have a very progressive family literally, moving at this age, it is not at all possible. I have my friends who are single and they are also giving a thought about coming to like moving out of the country after working 10 years, 12 years,  they spoke with their family and they got a clear rejection. Its like you're not allowed to go. Its their mindset. They don’t want them to move out. Just because you're not married, you cant move out.

So it all depends upon how I face things over year and how I go from one level to another level over you, then they will get the confidence that yes they can send their daughter.M:\\tSo firstly, let's just tell me when did you come to Canada first? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tOkay, so like if you're asking me exactly for vacations or you just want me to just tell you like exactly when I actually moved? So, when I'm came for vacation that was when I was maybe like 10 years old. Okay. was a long time ago. Right now I'm 22. So I'm guessing like the 2010. Yeah. And it's only for vacation. So we just came. So my mom, married. Sorry, my mom met this guy back in 2010. And he was in the in the business kind of thing. She went and met his boyfriend at that time. And then, like, they got a connection. And then they had like, it was like, sorry, my English is so bad. So basically what happened is like, they meet and then they start talking to each other. And then they have a really good deep relationship. So it was like a long distance relationship kind of thing. It was really good. I mean, we love the guy. I mean, he was really good with us. He was cool with her. And he always invited us to Canada. The first time I went to Canada, it was in Alberta, no, sorry, it was Qcebec. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo that was he was Canadian. And they went to they met in Mexico?', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tYeah. So he went for vacations. And my mom was going for a business trip. Oh, so they met in there and then they had a connection and it was awesome. Then they started like having going deeper in their relationship. And then we started going together. We went to Quebec as a family, my brother, me and my mom and him. And we went to a sister in Quebec, and it was amazing. I love that place. And we always have the opportunity to say like, this is an amazing country. We should live here right? Yeah. We never came across. It was only got like, kind of like a vacation kind of thing right. Then after that, when we came it was in Alberta, again with my mom and then I came with just myself. My brother, I think he stayed in Mexico. And that was in 2000… You're making me think…. long time. I think it was in 2012. We come back to Alberta. We went to Banff. It was beautiful. We stay there for a long time. And then after that, we came... My mom stay there from Mexico. We stay there for a little time. And then they decided to just get married. That was in 2015. So, after three years, they they after the relationship was good and everything. They broke up, I think, for one or two years. And that was like the gap of a few years they broke off and then they came back. And then he decided to say like, hey, like, you know what, let's get married. Bring Dante, bring everything. Let's just go there. And my mom asked me she was like, What do you think? And that was I was 17 by the time. So, it was kind of like a hard decision. Yeah. Like, it wasn't like kind of like, I was so excited. You know, like when they tell you 17 go to the new Canada and new country. And mean it was so good. And I love to, like, I loved this country. Like when I met them here, everything what I did and here in Canada when I was on vacation, I was like, Yes, I wanna live here. So yes, I came in 2015 when I when I moved.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo in terms of motivations behind your migration, like did you when you when your mom told you like, think of like, what are your thoughts like, what did you consider in your, in your personal sort of mind like in making that decision to ', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tSo one of the main problems was, I guess it was school wise. So because we don't we didn't know what's going to happen, right. I was in in high school at that time in Mexico City. Okay, so I was kind of like finishing in my second year of high school. I wasn't doing that great to be honest with you. Yeah. I wasn't doing great in school. At that time. I was like, mostly partying, you know, in high school, partying, friends going out and everything. So my mom told me like, it's a big decision, you know? She lost her job. So, it was a good thing for her. Like, she, she she lost it. So I'll tell you what was the behind of it. So my mom, she worked for a pharmaceutical for maybe 16 years. A long time. She got a good job and she got to pay. We live really good play with all the time was private schools in Mexico City. We got like a really good life. And my mom, she always worked hard for stuff. She was a lonely parent. And so she was it was really complicated for her right. But at the end of the day, she did it. She brought two kids. So both of us were really. Right now at this time, so I'm like she's proud of us and I'm proud of my mom. Right? And she was the main. She's the still one of my thoughts that she makes me keep going. right. Um, she, after she lost her job, it was so hard for her to actually find another job. So, because of her age, right, in Mexico City is really hard to actually find a job as a woman and as a as your age, right? Like, they don't take you seriously. My mom is an accountant and she has her degree. She was she's a professional worker. And unfortunately, she couldn't find a job. But she find a job good job. Like when she was in the middle of when she broke up with, with Frank, or with his ex-husband. And it was a good job too. And she she loved the job. She She liked it. And she was like, Well, I'm gonna stay here right? When this person actually offer us to go to Canada. It was a big deal too for her. There was a lot of problems. The thing is first, her job, then my school that was one of the important things because I'm 17 right so I have to go with her. It's not like a question on matter to say like, oh, you're staying here in Mexico and then I'll go there. No, it's like a family thing like to bring everything from there right? In Mexico for her was really it was like that's why she asked me because she told me like, well, you're not going to have school. You're going to finish your a year and then I might lose I'm gonna lose my job and here and also the problem was the house. She has a house she owns a house in Mexico, and it's with my my dad. Right? Unfortunately with my dad she always have problems with him. So it's kind of like…it was it was kind of hard and that time I guess. I'll say one of the motivations… that basically what you asked it was…we needed like a clean slate. I think we was an escape, you know. I think my mom was tired of it. She saw an opportunity to live with someone with… her love of life. And to bring me there. I think it was a plus too, right? I mean, I didn't say no, I just, I was so excited about it. I think I saw a great opportunity to be here. I mean, I even invested like, into my research and everything. And I thought, like, you know what, it is a good opportunity, you know what I mean? Like, I could finish school in there. I didn't thought that it was like, kind of like a much of a loss. But now that I think it is, we lost a lot of things… we lost…it's a culture wise. I mean, it was a change of culture. It was a change of people. It was a change, a family, it was change of everything that was surrounded by us, right. And it was just taken away. Right. Like, for me, my perspective was taken away and then just coming through the country, right. So yeah, I think that's that's one of the things that I don't know if I answer your question, but I don't know like\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd so where's your mom? Now she and she's in Canada? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tShe's in she she has a permanent residence. but she was she right now she went back to Mexico to fix her legal problems with… with the house with the house. Yeah, just, it's half my dad's and half hers. It is still like kind of a problem in there. I mean, my dad is he doesn't want to see any of us that he doesn't wanna see me, doesn't see my brother, See my mom. So it's kind of like, hard. I mean, I already forgave him so. So I really don't mind. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd so the partner that she was with in Canada, is she's still with him?\", '', '', '', 'Da:\\tNo, they got divorced. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tNow in terms of ethnic background, your your ethnicity. background is ', '', '', '', 'Da:\\twhere I come from. Mexico, Mexico. 100% Mexican. Pure Mexican. [laughs]', '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd professional background. So let's talk about professional mean, you moved here when you were really young, you still had school to do. So did you what type? Like what how did that sort of that translate into current professional life? What what happened from there? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tThe thing that I find most interesting in this in this country is that they don't accept anything that is from Mexico. So, so any any background or anything that you have or anything like that, it's just like zero. Like when you come here, it's just you start like again. Yeah, so when I came here to to Edmonton, I thought, like, okay, so I have in my high school, can you accept my two years and say, No, you have to do an exam. And then from that exam, we will put you somewhere. Unfortunately, when I went to high school in that time, I was 18. So I was 17 at that time when we moved in, but then I turned 18 right away, right. So in the laws in there and Edmonton unfortunately when you are a 18, you're not you're not a dependent, right? So the reason why we have to move that fast is because I had to be with my mom when 17. Right? Because otherwise they wouldn't take me. They wouldn't say like, No, he's an adult, he has to make his own application. So for the application, that's the whole reason why they took me when I was 17. Right. After when I was 18 in there, they don't accept any high school students. Thankfully, I don't know how but like my like how the school was in Mexico. It actually like my level. It wasn't that bad. I was like, almost finishing. When I came here, I did my high school, maybe one year. I didn't finish high school. It was an option. The reason why is because I saw an opportunity and I plan it. My plan was to basically to only finish the courses that I need to go to college right? from college, go to university. That was my whole point and my mom agree with it. And even her husband agreed, Right. And he was like, Yeah, that's a great idea. I mean, and I was going to the trades kind of thing. environment. And that's the whole reason why I took that that path, right? unfortunately didn't work. It didn't work as well as I thought but yeah, like I did. I only have I don't have my high school diploma. But I have the like, the knowledge of it, basically. So I have the courses to actually go to college? If I want to go to college right now, I can, because in here the system… they only asked you for something. Like if you have math and English passed… then you can go to college. You don't need to have a high school diploma. Right. You only need a high school diploma if you want to go to university, right. So in my thought it was like, at that time, I was thinking about the price, right? So university’s really expensive. Yeah, right. So I was thinking so I can get college. And then once I go to college, then I can go to I can pay less. Then once it pay less, and then after the year and I become a permanent resident and everything, I will pay less for university. So on time being, I can actually be in college and then go to university. So that was a whole point. So that was the that was my thinking, right? Go to college, pay less. And then after I have my degree or something, I will go to university. It was a good plan at the time. But like, if you're asking me for any professional background, I don’t have any. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tso you're working in the bank right now. So how did that happen?\", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tSo how that happened? So basically, in the bank, they don't ask you for for that. They don't ask you for high school diploma. So and it's about experience and much more about customer service. I think I learned a lot. I have a lot of experience. And that's what actually taught me. I've been working in the customer service …in the industry for a long time. And I think I know how to do it Good. I guess sometimes when I don't know if you heard that before, when people they tell you like, you don't need education for actually be successful. And, and it is true. I mean, it's about how you have a connection with people and how you actually can interact with them. Right. So I learned that and it been helping me for a long time, right. So yeah, and I was actually trying to go to do the school. My thinking is still going to school because I do still want to go to school. Next year, I'm planning to go to school… to university or to college. Well, first to college and and you know, right so, but I'm still debating which where to go right. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what do you want to study? ', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tLike I said, it's it's a really hard decision, because there's a lot of paths in the in the banking industry. They're opening me a lot of doors. They already offer me two jobs. Like as a financial advisor? I just need to do, like a license to sell mutual funds and to talk about mortgages or any ideals kind of thing. So, yeah, like I mean, I do I'm gonna do it in this year. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAll right, so Okay. I suppose I mean this question. I don't know whether this applies to you really. But like, if, if you can remember or I suppose think about in terms of time, how long did you plan your move, prior move? Was there any planning at that time that went in your patos? Was was that all sort of that taken care of by your mother? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tIt was actually really fast. It was in a one year period. Because my mom plan it really good with him, okay, and they plan it in a way that we can actually move together as a family. Right. So it was not a big planning on my on my way. I did, I have to do a lot of things right. Like I had to finish a lot of things in Mexico City. I had to finish my degrees in there from high school before I actually leave, my passports I have to do all I have to do all by myself, because my mom was working at the time. So I actually helped my mom to do all those kind of like, paperwork, paperwork. And she was she was she needed the help. So she was so happy about that. Right. I helped her for a lot of things, because most of the things were in English, so I had to translate for her and I did explain her and detail what actually the things they need. Mostly we did them… I think it we would have planned in, we wouldn’t be here if I if I'm honest with you. If we wouldn't make that rush decision, I don't think we would’ve been here. The non-planning worked, I think, I think in in this sense yes. Because if we would have seen maybe like in, in a long term kind of thing, I think we, I would’ve said no. Or my mom would say no too. After all that we have struggled. And after all that we have seen and what we've gone through, I think I would say no. And my mom, the same. I think we would be better in Mexico. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tYou would be better in Mexico, you think this now?', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tNot like life wise, but we would never go through that stage. I mean, through that period of time. I like, I didn't like that struggle to be honest with you. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd what was that struggle if you don't mind? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tYeah. So I'll explain. So I'll tell you the story, basically. So what happened is that he married she married. My mom married this guy. They've been together for maybe six years. Their relationship was good. Everything was amazing. Like we went to trips together. He came to Mexico. We have always good time. We have fun with him, right? I even see him as a dad sometimes, right? Like, I did like him and it hurts me because he's now that I think about it. It's just like, I lost two father figures, right? Like one that I like, my my dad that doesn't recognize me as a son. And then the other one…that I thought, I could have a dad and then it just got taken away, right. So basically what happened is like after a year, we live in there. It was a struggle with him. I guess the reason why I think he lost, he lost his job in Edmonton. So he was living by his pension, and he just got divorced recently, too. And then he lost half of his money right with his ex-wife. So everything was really tight with him, like with kind of money wise. At the beginning it wasn't. At the beginning, everything was perfect. Like maybe the first four, three months. It was really good.  I didn't complain when my mom didn't complain or anything. But we thought that we had a future in there with him. We were planning, like planning about all these things… school, I was planning about my school, I was planning for a lot of things. Then it got to a point where money was one of the main problems. So I had to start working. I work as a bartender back in Edmonton. First as a busboy, you know, bussing tables, and my manager loved me. So, all the servers love me too. They love the way I interact with clients. So, they told me Hey, you want to be a bartender? I was like, Yeah, for sure. So, I started being a bartender. I love that job. I love the people that I met in there it was so nice. I I was feel at home. I met some… so good friends in Edmonton and I still talk to them. I mean, I miss them. My best friends I ever had. Then after that, we lost... He was getting into a depression kind of mode. Because he was at home every day. So because he doesn't have job doesn't have nothing to do, right. So he was getting into that mode and he was really, really depressed. It got to a point that like food, like it was the even shorter. Like literally he was basically like, no, like, you can't eat that much. Why you eat that much? Like, you’re wasting money, you're wasting this and it was always a struggle. My mom didn't like that either. My mom she suffer a lot with him I say…just just going back you just reminded me like, How does she like deal with it? Right? So when they married, my mom did everything for love. She… She didn't expect anything back. She didn't do anything. Like, she didn't want anything. Like back she didn't want any money. Nothing right. She even signed a prenup for him. So if anything happens like she would never have it, right, that's how much she loved, right? Unfortunately, like we didn't knew about this…because we trusted him. But he did something like inside that… basically said like, you cannot have anything like, like it was it was really bad, that prenup. So we got into the point that my mom was trying to just suck it up just for me. So, she was thinking like Okay, I'm gonna suck it up for a year and then we can stay here, we get the papers and then we can figure out something out. This is for the permanent residence because we apply as a sponsorship.  So he was our sponsor for me and my mom. Yeah. And basically, that's that's what happened, right? So then, it was really, it was really hard like my mom and him they never speak. My mom sometimes had to sleep in floor and had to do some stuff. She was.. she didn't like.. She always… she's she's a happy person, right? So she always go out to, always go out to be like, you know, I'm gonna go out she did. She loved working with kids, so she even volunteered for that. And she'd go out and help kids and everything right? I always go to work, school. I was doing part time, and part time, at the time. And I was really I was doing really good. I was focusing on my studies and I was looking after my work too. I loved it. I was really good in English in Edmonton and I was really surprised. I was like, wow, like, I was like, Wow, really, really good. And that's, for some reason. I was like, wow. In Mexico I was really bad but now in Canada, I'm really good for some reason. What happened? [laughs] you know. But yeah, after that, then he decided to… One month…he was like, kind of, like suspicious kind of away. So he, he was like, basically telling my mom like, threatening her like, you know what, Im gonna cancel the visa, Im going to cancel the papers. We never thought about that. I even told my mom, she would ask me like, can he do it? and I was like, “yes, he can, but I don't think he would. So, one day he comes, and I think ie was like, mostly the economical stress and maybe the depression that he has, because he was looking for a job at that time and he couldn't find it. Like he wanted the same pay and the same things and you would never get something because he didn't have like the diploma. So, like experience unfortunately, doesnt pays you off. That's why I want my papers [laughs]. You know, unfortunately, But yeah, I mean, one day he came in, he just said, so I cancelled the papers. So he didn't even tell us nothing. Apparently, he cancelled it one week before. He was going to the lawyers and he cancelled the whole sponsorship. So he literally went to the thing. And then we've been checked online, we called and they say “yeah, your sponsor just cancelled the application”. So, the case has been closed. So, there's no way that we can help. Because as the rule in Canada once a sponsor cancels, unfortunately, they once they close that file, that’s it. They move to the next one. It is sad. I mean, just like it makes me feel like sometimes they protect more them, their own people than actually us. Right Like as an immigrant…we don't… we didn't came here to do a bad thing. I mean, we were productive. I mean, I was working. My mom was working. My mom…like as a as an accountant, professional accountant, she had to do cleaning floors and everything. Right? We came here we gave everything up from Mexico City just to come here and do all that type of work that we will never came into.. cross our minds, right? So I feel bad about that too for my mom too, because I'm like, all the hard work that you did everything, all the money that you make and everything and it's just for you to start to just working as a cleaning and she was like, I don't care. Like, I'm proud of it. I mean, that's, that's why I love my mom, right like she. Shes just happy. Yeah, so, I mean, and unfortunately, he didn't actually help us out. Because it wasn't like I don't feel like it was like, like he didn't protect us. Like, I feel like in that thing. Canada needs to actually focus on those people too because just by like a snap of a finger, someone just can tell you know, you can go back to your country. \\tSo it was 2015. He cancelled the papers in 2016. So, in November. So it was basically because you need two years of sponsorship and then you get the PR. So he cancelled it after a year yeah, so he cancelled…that's what I mean it's just like doesn't make sense to me …like someone… and then like he was even so funny because even actually bought the tickets because he actually like, kicked us out of the house because…he literally, one day he's like here is tickets from Mexico City. I don't want you in my house. You have a month leave. I already bought the tickets. That's it. So yeah, so that's what I mean when they when they ….they don't realize people ….they don't realize… like how easily someone can just ruin someone's life and then just decide.. just not to do it. Right. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOnce this happened, how did you learn about migration options that were available to you after that? ', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tSo we went to a lawyer.Yeah, for sure. We went to a lawyer because we were scared. We didn't know what to do. And my mom, thankfully, she had, she knew a lot of people at that time. So they connected her to them. And she knew a really good lawyer and thanks for her Thank you her! Like, she actually went for it. So, the funny part about that, the lawyer thing of like, the thing that you asked, it is like the system in here is just, it doesn't make sense. Some lawyers, they just give you they just tell you, okay, you can come here, we will charge you this. And they tell you things that …they're not true. They give you misinformation. Most of the lawyers. Thank god this person my mom know her and she was… she knew a lot of cases so my mom she's really careful with that right so she's like okay so because we try others too and they were like, No. And they basically tell us like… no you have to go to your country. You have no options, you have to go. Like you can apply… you don't know English, they are not going to give you an opportunity… Your age is not going to be enough points to actually work for Express Entry. Right? And for me, they told me Yes, he can do it but he has to go to school. He has to start working and once he starts to work after school, then he can apply. And so me and my mom, we decided like you know what, if that happens, then we started saving money. We started saving money for for my school, and then we start saving money for her too in the future, right? Mostly my mom did it for me, for my school because we knew how expensive is going to be the school. Right? And yeah, like, it's just lawyers in here in Canada, they don't actually help you. And that's one of the main problems I think in everywhere in every province and every city, there's one out of 10… that they actually want to actually help you. And they care about what they're doing. Because most of them, they just want….they just want the money, how we're gonna pay them. And then if it gets accepted, that's good. If it doesn't, next. So, I feel bad because I'm one of the lucky ones at least, I got the good advice from a lawyer. And even though like lawyers are so exhausting, like we have to be in the back of them all the time, because they don't do their work. And that's what I told to my mom, you know what, you were paying her money. You need to actually to… Like the word is not claim. Its like demand… You have to demand her to do her job. It's her job but and you're paying for her. Its not like a free service. If its free, okay, I understand. But, they told us… like we never heard about that option.. the humanitarian option. After we explain our story to the lawyer, she was like, you know what, you qualify for doing a humanitarian visa, as a humanitarian basis and you can apply as a PR. She even told us like, it is rare that these cases, that they get accepted. So, it has to be a really hardship… like a really hardship thing that happened to you that they will accept it. Otherwise, they'll not accept it. So we said right. Yeah so that was by the lawyer.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tIn terms of your family's you said it was you your mom and your brother?

They are, I will say in Toronto, they're the laziest person that you will ever met in your life. All community. My mom went to all different type of communities to have some help. And nobody would help her.. like Spanish. Most of them were like Spanish. She asked for legal advice, because she needs to divorce with that guy, right. She asked for legal advice mostly, because she wanted to get the divorce. And even for to ask for the papers and we're doing actually the right thing…the humanitarian basis… they were like No, he's a Canadian, you're an immigrant. You're not gonna get anything, they're not gonna help you out. He has the right. That's basically what we got from a community center where we're supposed to actually help each other. And it makes me mad because he's just they’re people that… they're actually getting paid by the government, that they are not doing their job. They are not actually helping. And it's just, it is unfortunate because I seen it even when I work in the bank. I've been trying to reach this communities to actually help immigrants and me I will myself I want to help them out to do their banking, but they don't.. They just don’t wanna do it. I I really think that community centres, with the government, I think they're stupid, like, I mean, like, I mean, they should not be actually there. I mean, they should not be there. So waste of money. taxpayers money. It is a waste of money. All my friends.. they are immigrants. My friend Kosta, he's from Spain, he went through the same situation, okay. Well, not the same. But he, unfortunately he came when he was 18. So, they didn't give him the papers with his parents. So his parents got Express Entry because they were professionals and everything and they were from the UK. So right away, they get into the permanent residence. But like he was 18, so they didn't give it to him. So unfortunately, no, but we're talking to each other and like, we were mad …we were were even I remember when I was, like, we're even talking about how stupid the system is and how unfortunately for people that like us who actually want to work and want to contribute, and actually not use any of their taxpayer money, which they complain a lot, we actually want to be in this country to work and to do something productive. Unfortunately, they don't give it to us. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tNow you told me the visa processes and everything. You know what we can pretty much move on to the map. One last question before that.

I deal with a large amount of money too with clients and I think I'm like my boss loves my job like I think I've given them so well that they're happy with. Like I don't get no complaints from any of my bosses so not my boss. He doesn't have no complaints. I have… I have an attitude problem but that's different case. When he doesn't go my way, I get frustrated.. I get like an attitude problem but I think that’s the sassy part of me. So the most proudest thing than I am is for learning languages. So I learned… in a period of one year I learned French so I'm now with speak French and I speak English and Spanish on the level of a local person. And I'm proud of that too, to be honest. Because I learned it by myself. I didn't learn in school, I just learned by myself and I used to speak with my French clients, they love me too. I always talk to them. They're so nice. And also, I think I one of the main things, I think, and it's, I think it's a skill, because I want to be part of the community to help them. I've been trying to reach for a lot of community centres. I've tried to be part of the LGBTQ community, they’re HIV positive too...some people then to help them out for the banking because a lot of refugees that they come in here, they don't know where to go, and they go in there, and then they help them out. So, I try to help them out here, right. So, I'm being trying to be part of these communities. But for some reason they put so many reviewers, so they don't trust you and they think that they want that you want something out of them. And at the end of the day, I'm like, like I told them… I even tell them I don't get nothing from this. I can give my clients based in there, and that's it, right? Like, I don't need you right there. I don't need to do my work. But I do it because I want to be part of the community, I want to help you guys out. Because I think people are really misinformed. And people are not getting what they actually want to and what they need. So I think that's a skill to I think, like, I learned that I don't want people to go through the same situation with me or my mom, where they just tell you what to do what to do, and they don't have the option. Right? Like, I hate that. Like, it pisses me off if someone tells you like, yeah, you have to do this and this and that. And they don't explain you details. For me, that's, that's like, like, that's disrespectful because it's like you're you're someone your person, and you deserve to actually have options and you deserve to actually be to know what's going on. I mean, it's your money and its your things and you have the full right to actually know everything. So, I always do that to my clients and I try to do that for them. So, I'm proud of that. \", '', '', '', '', '', \"M:\\tso firstly, let's go through all the visa categories you went through from the first point of arrival to the current status, including any wait times, processing times…\", '', '', '', 'Da:\\tYeah, I have to think about, all right. I have So many visas in Canada as I wonder.', '', \"So I think the first one would be my first visa. So I got my student visa first. student visa. so I got my student visa, student visa and that was seen back in 2015. Okay, okay, as a sponsorship. So when you have a sponsorship. When this is the sponsorship, you can get the visas really fast. I got my student visa the time so even though you're under the sponsorship you needed a student visa is …so basically this is not a visa being sponsorship. When you are being sponsored, they give you those visas in order for you to wait to the way to permanent residency. They give you those visas and then after that, then you can work and study whatever. Yeah, so I got the student visa. And that was me before I got I came here. So it took maybe like 3 months period…Give or take. Yeah, when I came here in 2015 when I moved there. So that was the first visa that when I got here. After a year, I was still in the sponsorship thing. So that was in 2015. I'm just saying I'm just wondering because I started working. So I was in school for a year. Yes, those 2016 So, in the gap of the sponsorship, I was still there. I went for a working visa, work visa. But this one, same, you took three months. Like it's a give or take, I think they given to me a little bit faster, because I was in the sponsorship. So when you're in sponsorship, they give you things way faster. Because you like when they have someone that can get in touch you like to be in the back of it. Then it makes it makes the process faster for some reason I don't know why. This was in 2016. I wanted to work. So I was like, you know, what I'm going to work for that time me until I get the PR. So I was thinking that and they say yes, that's…that's a great idea. After that, they just cancel my papers. So, this was in September. When I go my working visa go to the same time, I think August or September. So I got that in August. So this is when I was in the sponsorship. Then this is the sponsorship. Yeah, after the 2016. So when I was in, in December and December, it came here…December November it was time gap I got so my papers got cancelled. But, by the time that work visa was still valid, so I can still use that working visa, no problem. So even if they cancel your sponsorship, the working visa is still valid. So it wasn't it wasn't a problem after that. So December, once it was cancelled, it was fine. It wasn't a big deal. So then we went to the lawyer. And then she started the humanitarian process. They wanted to put that too. Yeah. So all these. So in that time, because we knew that he cancelled he was in November in December. So because its not a visa, so these things …like the sponsorship and the humanitarian, it's a I don't know how to explain it. It is like a process. But it's not an actual visa and it doesn't give you status. It doesn't give you nothing. It's just like, like, you apply for it. That's it, basically. So because basically, they give you your permanent residence as a humanitarian basis, or they give you your permanent resident as sponsorship, or they give you your permanent residence as a work skill as a skilled worker, or an express entrant. So that's how it works. Then I went to the humanitarian and that was in December 2016. That was when the process got started. Yeah, that's like a timeline. And then after that, I got my work permit until (checks phone) So I have the exact dates. And with the humanitarian, you can remain in the country though. That's what they were explaining us, like, as long as you have your working permit, they cant take you out of the country. If you don't have your working permit, then they will ask to leave right away. So, I have this one. They give you a lot of working permits. They ask you a lot of papers like it's because in that process if you like, do you want to know what actually they asked me? My working permit got expired so I had to apply. So, at that time I was working in the butcher shop. So, this time, during the time I will start working in the warehouse and so at this time, I was working in the butcher shop. And then I was working also in the warehouse. So my work permit was perfect and, and everything and… I was afraid because they might not give me my working permit at that time because any of these jobs are not skilled, right? and if they don't accept the humanitarian basis they don’t give you the working permit. You are making me think a lot of things. Coz in that time I got a letter of acceptance. I was still working the butcher shop, but that's fine. Then in 2017 in August, so when I was here… August 2016, I started working at the bank. So my my boss, actually, like, offered me the job. And then I quit that job. And then I stayed in the butcher shop. And then from this one I went to here and then to the bank. It's actually not that bad. And then when I was in the bank in 2017, I actually asked for a work permit. So, they asked me for a lot of things and then they say yes, so in that time, my working permit expired in August and gave it to me because I apply. So it was started working at the bank and then at that time, I have to apply for my my working permit and my working permit. They gave it to me in like after, like after three months, too. So when we knew about the working permit was accepted. We thought that so the lawyer told like if they accept the working permit, it means that they're going to give you the permanent residence, or it means that your humanitarian processes going in a good direction. So I remember I'm not 100% sure, but I remember that in this period of time in 2017. Because this is 2017. So, this is like in January, like in January, sorry. January to May - And then in this period of time, I remember that we got a letter, a letter that said that they will accept the humanitarian basis and that they will and they will actually like go through the process of it, but that doesn't mean that you're accepted. That's what they tell you. So that's, that's the intention of accepting it. Like, we will review this file as a humanitarian basis. But we don't know if you get approved for the permanent resident or as a humanitarian. So we got the letter of of …I will put it like letter accepting, accepting humanitarian…and then after that, yeah, I think that's most of the visas. Yeah, that's all I got. Yeah, it was a student and work visa and then another work visa and then I got another work visa actually action. Okay, so the work visa, because they gave it to me in 2018 because it expired. It was for only one year. So yeah in 2018 of July, so it expire at that time. So in July 2018 yeah because they give it to me for for one year….apply for work permit and it was three months this one.. and it was an open working permit as well.. that’s important. Because they give you restrictions so this one…. that the one that I had for this work visa [before], it only gives you a certain way you can work into certain in a specific places so you cant work everywhere. It gives you restrictions and their conditions in all of the work. And this one was with conditions. And they were saying that I know you can't work at this, we can all look at that. So I got the July 2018 …for the open and they they gave it to me for for two years. For the two years, when I knew about that, even my lawyer told me like you know what, you are going to get accepted for the permanent residence because that's how long it takes for them to give you your permanent residence. And it's true. So my permanent residence I even got it. They give you a PR card. So my PR – I got it on July 2019. So you see, like, it's, it is a whole… I'm sorry, like its a really bad map. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo we'll move on to commercial services that you use, right. So in terms of on your map itself, can you tell me the commercial services, the things that you paid for to get your PR?\", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tSo for that one we didn't pay for the my step… my..my mom's ex husband. He paid I don't know how much to be honest with you…for the sponsorship.\", '', \"Yeah, I have spent a lot of money. Mostly most of it, I would say would be almost like 30,000 for me and my mom. $30,000…that included, that's included the lawyers and I think I would be even more. So sponsorship, you pay for the student visa and my moms working visa. So I'm just gonna put my working visa (mom). Then there is a price as lawyer so…lawyer…that's another expense. What are they actually the charging for that they fix their own fees… I don't know how much you pay ..But like I say I'm pay for lawyers, the student visa and the working visa. So after the sponsorship when I did the humanitarian, we had to give $5,000 just for the application process. So the five thousand dollars he was the application process and that was not guaranteed, right. So it was just to start the process. We had to give the half of it. So one half first. And then the other half when we finish. My mom talked with the lawyers and she said ill pay that. That’s only the lawyers fees .. that’s only for the humanitarian itself, right. So this is only for this kind of thing. But then they charge you for other things, right. They charge you for the working visa for me and my mom, and then they charge you for the translation. So that's all the translation for all the documents like cards, anything that you have any like proof, any school or anything that I think it was least $1,000 coz it was my moms and mine.  I'm not gonna give him like exact numbers, but that's what I think it was the estimate. It really expensive, because they charge you by page. The other thing…the government fees…course because it doesn't come included with the government fees just to apply. They charge you just to put your information in so much then they charge you I think like $300 that is actually expensive because you're going to pay for a working visa, but they will charge you to have a right for visa basically. All right. That's for humanitarian.. I think I paid even more even more for that. Because we moved in here, we have to like pay the like the sending of documents. So when we send the documents the government, we also have to pay for that. So, the shipping of documents. So basically the lawyer will make all your file and everything they will stamp they make everything and then you send it to the government. So it's not online.  So we have to pay for those because they want actual copies of everything. So we have to pay for those shipping documents and makes it expensive because it's important documents… we don't want to make it lost because Canada post is the worst that you will ever have. I will never use Canada Post in my life. So you have to send it by UPS or FedEx basically. I think it's like 75 bucks just for sending documents. when I was in here….in Toronto….Ill say accepted process. I had to pay for my working permit. I also pay for the shipping because I had to send it to my lawyer. This lawyer was based in Edmonton. There's a process online - Yes, but  because this is humanitarian, they have to make the case. So the lawyer makes like a big huge case for you like 20 pages or something like that. And then they explain why you should take care, why are we actually applying. So I did take my medical, medical exams - you have to pay for blood testing and everything. They don't give it to you for free. So, it's blood testing is expensive. Why? I mean, it makes no sense. Then the right right to having this card [PR card]. It was $500. Just to have the right of being a permanent residence, you need to pay 500. They make money. That's why…that's why… I don’t understand because people tell me like “you leave from taxpayers money. Yeah, I wish I could see that money. Where is that money? because I don't I haven't received it yet. What else - fingerprints, prints from Mexico and from here. I have to be that from Mexico and from here so I think for me just to send them to Mexico, it was like hundred. She was like, just to send them and then I have to do the process. It's just too much work that that police think that it was because they want to make sure that they make a background check and everything and then they send it to the country and in the country. They send them to whatever the embassy That's right. So fingerprints, both of them because you have to do it twice…Fingerprints and background check. I think that’s it. I think it's more but I don't remember. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tWe'll move on to the next question. So tell me the role of technology. Did you use technology in your migration journey at all? Did you use any sort of online resources to conduct research on social media? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tYeah, I think that we did but it is horrible. Online, the experience is horrible. Our case for some reason it wouldn't show online so we were like in blind form because they don't tell you anything… like normally they say in the website… they say that you can check even on your phone. They give you two options either you go to through phone channel – it takes hours – or online. The problem with online is that our case for some reason in never like…. never like existed in their system for some reason. I don't know why it was just like, wandering around for some reason. So yeah, somewhere. I mean, I hate that online. And I hate the phone chat. I think they're not... When they get them hold of you. They're really nice. And then they give you really good customer service. I have to admit that, but they don't give you no information. They even tell you like we're not gonna give you any information on the trial, you have to wait until actually respond to you, like we're not gonna give you any information at all. The online it gives you a lot of research. But to be honest with you, it's scary to do it by yourself because you can do it you can do the application yourself. Even the government says you can be yourself like you just pay for it and then that's it. But it is a scary because if you miss something, if you use anything, like you say something wrong, or you don't know what actually that question actually means or anything like that - Denied right away and then they give back. So, is it worth it. Might as well just do it the right way and then just from a lawyer, because I see people and I know people that they have actually done it online. They're working permits, they take it online. And they do it by themselves. Like their permanent residence or their working permit. They do it by themselves. So, it's actually interesting because I was like, well, I should have done it, but I feel like it was safer. I'll say….this one none of them work. I hate them. I hate I just hate him like, this is so hard.  So the CIC website - that's one of the main pages and it tells you everything… it gives you. Like, just like, it doesn't give you like an explanation of why you have to do this. I mean, it tells you the time and everything. But it tell them in their own way. Okay, you have to wait this period, this time. But its like, Hey, can I know more? Like what do I have to do with that time? do I have to do anything else or what? So this was like no. My mom did did Facebook. There's like a community for latinos. They they talk about it or something like that. We didn't went through that. I don't think there's that much like online resources.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tTell me about your thoughts on immigration policies on current…Are you kind of on top of it? Do you keep a check on what what immigration is doing? ', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tUnfortunately I dont agree with any of the immigration policies that they have in this country or any where. So it might sound really bad but I think they're not fair…. they're not fair with how they select people and then how they accept people and unfortunately like we live in the world like a lot of people they have to leave their country not because of that’s what they want but because they don’t have another choice because their home it's been bombed or their home is being ….they're being threatened…. their kids are being threatened. And I understand that. I completely understand that. I mean, I think…I think that…for instance, I do not agree about the refugee stand for the Syria. Okay so the reason why is because the way they treat other people way better than us.. the actual immigrants, right? Basically, what the government is trying to make me understand is like so if youre actually having all this trouble and everything will give you everything. They give him the housing, they give them clothes, they give them all these resources to help them out to go through this life in Canada. Whereas the other parts ….where ‘us’ when I go into this category – Its like “no we don’t care, you need to pay and you have to figure out a way”. So, like in my my case, and a lot of people that I know… it's just not… I don't have nothing against their country or anything. It's everything like that…they can have everything so easy in the silver plate, but they don't realize how fortunate they are. is not the fact I understand completely. It's not a fact, I completely agree. They should actually give more help to them. And we should support. It doesn't make sense that you're helping all these other people and then just forget about the people that actually are contributing to your economy and are giving you money for that and we're not using any taxpayers money, or any we're not using any money or resources from any of the government. And at the end of the day, they really treat us like, like, “Okay, thank you. Thank you for coming”, you know. I even even see skilled workers, all the things that they have to go through, all the money that they have to pay. My friends, I’ve seen them - the scare of actually going back to your country because you don't actually perform in this country because they will you know, they see no, you can stay here because you don't qualify for it. I'm like, I'm thinking to myself like it is… like, how I'm not qualifying for it?, Like explain to me, how im not ‘qualifying’ for having to live in this country? I pay my taxes. I've been here for a long time and being a contributor for this society. I think and being part of here. I mean, it's not fair that you give priority to other people, just because your government and the choice of the people decided to do that. This is not even their fault. I'm not saying it's their fault. There's nothing to do with that. I mean, a lot of people they might thim im really.. a lot of people might not like my way of viewing things but its just like…its not fair to the person that he has worked so hard and then people like that the people like this… they going through that situation as a refugee, they don't appreciate what they really have. Sometimes its stupid… sometimes people like, they think they deserve everything in a way that and they show it to us like no I just. I'm not gonna work. I already have this. I have that… and I'm like that must be nice. I mean, like the refugees… they got greeted by the Prime Minister,they gave them clothes and everything - I didn't get anything. I didn't get any clothes. I have to buy my own. I didn't get any money. I have to actually pay taxes. I didn't receive any money back. I earned a lot of money for the government, just because I was working two jobs. Which makes no sense. I was like, in makes really no sense. Like how the government is actually doing this. Like, so what are you saying? Like, okay, so you have to work so hard to be in this country. You need to pay your lawyer. You need to pay your housing. Rent is not cheap here. You need to pay for your food. You need to pay for your normal expenses. And if it's something left to have a little bit treat for yourself, then you can have it. But then you see other people that they use the system. And I’ve seen it for long and I'm not saying it's only Syrian people. A lot of South American people do the same thing. And it's just so frustrating and its so, so like, like, it's just it makes me so mad. Because it's like, you have no idea what you have. Like they're giving you the opportunity, take it. Not everyone gets that opportunity. And that's what a lot of people don't understand. You know how many people actually want to be in a place where people are actually suffering back in their own back in their country, who are actually having a struggle. And then they come here, and they don't do anything. That makes me mad, because, at least at least in here, and what I have to say for myself is like, this space haven't been, it wasn't easy. At least I'm proud to say like, you know what, I'm a Mexican. And I came here to actually do something with my life and I actually work and I contribute to the economy. I am proud to be in this community and whoever told the opposite, that would be like no.. I do the same things as you. Because I see it with my partner. He's Canadian. So he has that conservative mentality that immigrants take everything.  Well, my ex partner… we just recently broke up. It's just because most of the people they say the same things. The same old comments that immigrants are taking their jobs or taking their, their opportunities, they're taking their money. And I'm like thinking like, No, that's not true. Like, the only reason why I had the job in the bank because Canadians don’t want that job. I mean that job is there.. I mean, we're the same.. I don't have enough experience. What is the difference between me and other Canadian? We have the same thing.\", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tI mean, that that makes me want to ask you another question now, in terms of romantic relationships and did your visa ever play a role or your status in this country playing a role towards towards having a romantic relationship or a partner?

So now just need only two years for citizenship. Which makes no sense. So I mean, like, I've been here four years in this country, you can't give me my citizenship right now?

And actually, they deserve to be here, and they actually want to have people there. Because it's not… like I like I keep saying it's not fair. And they give opportunity to other people that they should not be here. For instance, they should not take everyone.. you know what I mean? I think it and it's not about their background is not about their religion, it's not about anything. It's like they if you don't want to be part of this community are you doing here? If you don't want to get used to this culture, you don't want to be part of this culture. What are you doing here because culture is one of the main things and one of the main things that my mom and her ex-husband told me is like, you’re coming here, you change your culture. You're not Mexican, you're not. You're a Canadian. You're not celebrating any Mexican culture. You're not going to celebrate anything like that because you're in Canada. You're not in Mexico. And you know what? I agree. I say, You know what - you're right. If you come to my country, I will say the same thing, because you're in my country, you come here. And of course, I don't wanna, if im in Mexico, I don’t wanna celebrate Canadian holidays, right? It makes sense. I was like, Yeah, but unfortunately, a lot of people they don't like… they don't get that. They want to change the culture here. Which I don't agree with it because it's not..

So, they asked you for letters from Canadian people for comments. This opened my eyes for some people. A lot of people they helped me with this and it's people that they're my clients people that they’re still my clients. I think I got maybe…. they don't give you an estimate of how much you need to help…. but the lawyer says that the many you get the better right because them…. for the government it says like you were part of the community and then they know you. They know you. And I got so many beautiful letters from people that I just met …just one day and I asked for a letter and they say yes, like So nice people like I mean, and they're all from here, from Cabbagetown. I mean, a lot of people they say they say, it might sound stupid, maybe because it's just a letter. But it just opens your eyes. Right? Like, I mean, I'll show you one it's, it's, it's just beautiful. How people are. I just love… I love that's the whole reason why I love customer service because this is it gives you a better understanding of people. Right? So this is one of my my clients from the butcher shop. I just talked to… She's so nice, and she gave me this amazing letter. And it's just beautiful. How actually people express about you just by knowing you for a little while. I love it. I have more. They did handwritten letters too. It's just beautiful. How many people they actually open their, their way and they see something because that's what they told me is like, you know what, I see something for me, and then I see that you are going to be great in this country and then you deserve to be in this country. I'm like, thank you. So they asked you for banking statements. So for the humanitarian base, they asked me for the all your banking statements so basically all your banking history….you have you had a credit card, and your personal banking because you need to prove how you been paid. How you pay your credit cards. How many loans you have, taxes – that’s the most important thing. How do you pay your taxes? and it has to be every year so every year, But I will put you in there like this is the most important thing for me was the letters. Yeah, letters, I think. I think it opens the eyes. It makes the officer making the application makes understanding of who you are, right. I got letters from restaurants or letters from people, we got letters from from …from my My brother's bosses. I go letters from my bosses and hearing the bank to say yes for sure I'll write a letter for you. I don't mind. Its so nice right? I can't I just can't believe I went through that was just like it is it is a hard process. Like sometimes I like I told you right in the beginning, like I feel like if I would have stayed in Mexico, like I told you, if I would have known all of this, I wouldn’t have come.  I'm not gonna say this. I think it's like all the experience that I have in here and made me learn a lot of things. I think I'm more mature and a lot of things. I got a good job. I got a lot of people that help me support me and then being together with me how I got closer with my family even closer with my mom and closer with my brother. It feels great. I mean, I don't think I would have done this things in Mexico. I think it would have been different. I would have been in school right now. I think I would have done just the same just because I wanted to Mexico. When I was talking with my friends in Mexico, what have they done and everything. And theyre still in University, right, they starting and everything I'm like, I would love to actually be in there. You know, I wouldn't love to just feel that. I feel like when I came here in this country, make me to Miss A lot of things like school .. who doesn't want to go to university? Who doesn't want to interact with people your age, to have the same thinking to actually, like express different ideas with each other? Right? So I think I missed that I miss and I would have loved to have that opportunity to actually interact with people who are my around my age. And it's hard You know what I mean? When you see it when you see people that they go to universities, like, when I go to university, I'm gonna be old, people are gonna be younger. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tIs there anything else you want to say or add or otherwise I'll just stop it.\", '', '', '', 'Da:\\tI hope I help in something.

So I mean, it might not, but if we will, that would be great.M:\\tWhen did you migrate to Canada?', '', '', '', 'Su:\\tI came here December 2018.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tMotivations? So you got married but were ', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tYeah I definitely was looking out to move out of Pakistan because, where I was staying, in Pakistan what tends to happen is that you have a very limited skillset and people tend to have a very narrow notion about what you can do with your skills and what you can. And I feel I was always looking to move out of that sphere and get into a sphere where I could start over new and my past didn't really matter in terms of career and all that stuff. So I could study or I could go back and say go back to school, I could start working. I could start like becoming an entrepreneur. But my my, like what my motivation always was, was because I was so attached to Pakistan in terms of the not for profit and humanitarian work that I did in Pakistan. I always wanted to, even if I moved anywhere else, I always wanted to carry that goal in my head. So say you know whether I moved to like England or Canada or America I always wanted to sort of ignite this sort of, you know, passion and say maybe overseas Pakistanis or just other people about like arts and crafts in Pakistan and how much potential there is and how much like they're being exploited and how much so my connection was always like, I'll move out Yes, and I'll have like a primary day job or whatever, but I really want to sit down and like sort of promote our arts and like our crafts all over Pakistan… and our music and like everything because it's so rich culture. And in Pakistan, like stuff like Urdu’s wearing out. People don't talk Urdu as much. I and, you know, I mean, that's, that's the language to be proud of. Because honestly, like, I mean, unfortunately, even I can like sort of understand, like, very poetic Urdu because I haven't been brought up there, but I wish I could and I wish I could take pride in it because the kind of like linguistic like it's just everything. I think everything's from like authors like Manto to like poets like Faiz, like, Pakistani art like Sadeqain or so whatever you have, like they have so much more like struggle in their like in their Arts then. Well, it's wrong to make a comparison but I feel like there's so much struggle because it seemed very, very hard lives in that they’ve seen like partition they've seen like, the whole Bangladesh like, you know, \\\\ they’ve seen just a lot of fractions of life that maybe haven't and then our youth are not sort of. They're not. They're not informed about that as they should be. And I feel like wherever I wanted to go in life, I always wanted to inform people of my culture, whether they were Pakistani or not. So yeah, that's something that I always wanted to bring into. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tRight. So you like, I mean, tell me about your background. So you grew up outside of Pakistan? ', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tSo I was born in Islamabad. So my dad was a diplomat. After every two foreign postings he would have to come back to Islamabad to work at the Foreign Office. I was in Islamabad. When I was 2 I moved to Baghdad for about five years in Iraq and then then I moved to Indonesia for about three years. Then back to Islamabad when I was about seven, eight, and I went to school in Islamabad so this is my first sort of thing with with Pakistan. But Islamabad is very different culturally from Pakistan, from Karachi because there's a lot of foreign population like theres diplomats and stuff. So you don't really feel the typical-ness. You know, it's not claustrophobic, it's, it's a little more broad. And then after Pakistan, we moved to the Netherlands for about six years. I think that was my dad's longest posting and that was kind of like, has in a way become home for all of us in some way or the other and then after the Netherlands, I moved to Russia. So I was living in Moscow for about three years. My dad retired some time in February 2008. I was still in the middle of high school, I was doing my International Baccalaureate, and then so I obviously could not it was like, couple of months ago, my final exams I was seeking move back to Pakistan with them. So I stayed on in Russia all alone. And that was a lot of fun. But apart from that, like I learned about, like, what the Russian culture and about so many things and about just just how like, you know, and I remember ever since I was like, you know, 10- 11 I would just go on and on about Pakistan to my friends and how amazing the culture is I was just one of those like, you know, it's very proud of all of these things and, and people just like my wedding happened in December, and all my friends were like you've been raving about Pakistan for like, as long as we've known you. Like, we're so excited to come. They all, well, some of them came and, like, you know, it was nice. So, then I moved to London to do my law at UCL and then I thought I didn't want to do my bar, whatever I came back to Pakistan. And yeah the story starts from there in terms of work and then finding like, what I'm good at what I what my passions are, like, you know, all that kind of stuff. And it was very difficult sort of moving a step forward, because they're like, but your lawyer, why wouldnt you want to practice law? Why would you want to do this? Why would you want to do that? So So we actually did, like a couple of friends. We actually close… but honestly when I practice law, my my impetus was not to become like a corporate lawyer or like whatever you see in suits or whatever and all of that stuff and makes shit loads of money. It was…it was more like, I wanna work. So criminal law I want to do Human Rights, that's where I was heading towards. And both things in Pakistan are a challenge because a woman being a criminal lawyer, anyone being a criminal lawyer and most of the criminals are very sort of notorious. And you know, I started I remember I started visiting kurachi Central Jail quite a few times to get an idea to get people's stories because I liked writing also, I like writing also, and I remember getting calls and getting tracked and all of that kind of stuff. So that was, you know, just a little uncomfortable. So basically that happened then and then we like couple of our friends were like very passionate and stuff. We, together with the guidance of Asma Jahangir, she's she's a very well known like activist add lawyer in Pakistan. So we started this legal aid clinic, whereby we would work with people who could not afford Legal Assistance which is 70% of the population. So you know if there was like land crimes and you know people taking over their property or people taking the land or people taking over whatever… like whatever is domestic violence or domestic divorce, the husband not giving the divorce, whatever it was, we were kind of solving it and than unfortunately I got a job into another good corporation which was linked law remotely and so I said okay, why not? But I kept in touch with the legal aid clinic and I believe it's doing really well right now. It's it's like when we started we were like, like working from like, what like, basically just like someone was kind enough to give a room from their house, like, somewhere in Lyari, right which is a very…was a criminal infested area. But then, now I believe it has its own office and all of that stuff so it is picking up. I would love to do that kind of thing in Pakistan but unfortunately like, you know, there's implications to that. Yeah as there is anything that's a little out of, you know, boundaries or whatever. And there are a lot of boundaries. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo tell me about your your marriage so I mean your wedding. How did you meet your husband? ', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tSo I have met my husband about three years ago at like, so we knew each other through a lot of mutual friends but we never really like met and spoke. But then like a friend of mine, and friend of his suggested that we…like we should probably like, get to know each other and it was a mutual friend of ours whose wedding it was. And so, he introduced us and then you know, one thing led to another we started sort of like, this is December 2015. And he was only there in Pakistan for a holiday and I don't know what happened to me but I just took… I'm very careful about these things but I just took a leap of faith and then we started having a long distance relationship. I told him that like, the only the only way I'm gonna have a long distance relationship with you is if we make an effort to meet after three, four months whether that's, you know, Im not asking you to come all the way to Pakistan or I'm not going to come all the way to Canada but lets meet half way. Otherwise not going to work on the phone and all that stuff. So we try to make an effort to that consistently as possible. Year and a half into it, he wanted me my family. I met his and then from then on. We kind of like, sort of… Oh, we met like in our first holiday was in Lisbon that we went to Miami. We went to Barcelona, so, and he came to … he comes to Karachi every December. So that, and then San Francisco. So like just random places, right? That was one of the things I put in my head was like, Im not gonna go into this blind sighted, you know.  \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat does he do? ', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tSo he works for. He works for a company called Young Canada, and they are the parent company for restaurants like KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, etc, etc. And he looks after… like he's a franchisee and business coach.

So he travels a lot for work.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAll right. And had you been to Canada before you got married? ', '', '', '', 'Su:\\tNo. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay. All right now, I mean, we have actually discussed your professional background as well and in terms of your migration to Canada, did you plan this… So I suppose the right question would be your migration to your move to London.

I think I was just kind of following the footsteps of my brother by going to school in London. But in hindsight, I probably had a better option going North America, or Canada do my law, but I believe it was I just wanted to get it done. I was not a very studious student in any case, so I was sort of like, okay, so we get it done three years done. With America, like or whatever you'd have to do like pre law then. You know, but like being in America would have definitely been a more wholesome experience. Yeah, but but London is fabulous. Great place. You know, at the time, it's funny because right now, couple weeks ago, I read that they changed the law… and the students who graduate from… foreigners who graduate from English universities have a 2 year to find work and whatever. At that time we didn't have that. And with Law, it was a very, like Oxford, Cambridge, very strict, aristocratic, sort of, selection process where the top law firms had people were graduates from there. And obviously people who are not of my racial ethnicity, if you could say that, so that was very competitive. And that's why I came home. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd So I mean, in terms of work now, like you're looking for work now, what kind of work are you looking for? Is it legal or anything really?\", '', '', '', \"Su:\\tI think, I would say say like, anything, really. But I kind of gave that thought up a couple of weeks ago. I don't want to do anything really, because it really does take away from who I am. I'd either go back into the Arts somewhere or the other, do something with writing, if that was… if I were to follow my passion. And if I were to stick to what my expertise are in, it's more like not for profit, fundraising, humanitarian sector, like international NGOs, and, UN, whatever. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how are you finding the job market for those kinds of jobs? ', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tUmm not too bad, actually. Okay, not too bad, because they, they're very, they're a lot more good with handing out these jobs to people who have like, would have had like a diverse sort of background and cultural, whatever, you know, ethnicity, as opposed to giving them to people who are from here. I don't know why that is but that's probably a good a good thing I guess? I don't know, or maybe people over here just more into like finance and marketing. And that's what I tend to sort of hear every time. So when someone says I have a job, they're like, Oh, well I work for a bank for we work for, you know, whatever a company like Lowe's or you know, retail and that kind of stuff. So maybe that job market isnt built or maybe it'll be funny that way. But it hasn't been like hugely competitive to get a couple of interviews here and there. Like, yes, with the bigger places for sure.

So technically, my status is that I am a non-resident but I am allowed to work in Canada because I have a work permit. But my PR is probably due six, seven months from now.

Like a lot of research out of like, what lawyers are we gonna get are going to apply ourselves? What are the forms gonna look like? And like I said, like we were always like antsy about the fact that you know, how am I…are we going to be married? How am I going to live like apart from you like 10,000 miles apart? That’s so weird. And then working that around, and talking with people talking to different lawyers, and then coming up and saying, well, no matter what you can be an inbound applicant. So that was a very stressful procedure, especially for my parents as well, because they just didn't think they just couldn't imagine like, and then it was also stressful for me because I was like, So where am I gonna live? Am I gonna live in your house, your parents? Or am I going to live with my own family? Coz it makes no sense to live in your house and blah, blah, blah, like that, obviously, raised a lot of conflict, and because of conflict and pressure was there I think we moved on. I think I really pushed it like…No, we have to find a way to do like the whole inbound or whatever alternative we have. And I'm glad that lawyers are lawyers were not good enough to sort of suggest that to us, because doing on your own is just not as…as efficient like I'd say yeah, yeah. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd how's how's married life, generally living and moving into a new place? \", '', '', '', \"Su:\\tWhat I'd say married life is Probably like..So I came in and obviously there's like a lot of expectations you have when you move in with someone that you're dating.

There were a lot of his travels, a lot of like challenges in terms of us getting along as people because we realized we're complete opposite in work like, you know, for fun, but then when it came to practicality, it was like, okay, clash, clash. So obviously one or the other person, or both the take step back in their personalities. But it's been, like it's been challenging.. ill tell you what, its been challenging and we don't share the same interests at all. Obviously, he's been in Canada for what 15 years.

He's just like, yeah I've been there done that. And that's sort of like, you know, you’re kind of boring, like, but sometimes he'll he'll understand that like, okay, she just moved.

I'd be like meeting someone or the other something, you know, you know, I'm not like.. And as far as him moving away, like my mother in law comes and visits in the summer. So she's here these days, and she's like, if you want to come and stay with… She lives with their daughter, her daughter’s not married, so she's like, if you want to come and stay or whatever.

So for the visitor visa, the first time I applied for it I got rejected because to be honest, it was a very rushed and most people do apparently from Pakistan. This is the hardest visa, the Canadian visa is the hardest to get. So and to be honest, to be fair, I didn't really put in a lot of documents. I didn't really apply from my heart. So I just sort of gave it in and I got rejected. This time around, like there was a lot of documents and stuff and like a lot of because this meant a lot more or more stakes involved. At that point. I was just going to meet my boyfriend. And then I was this time I was like, you know, I need a visa visa in order for me to get into the country after we get married, right. So the process itself didn't take very long I believed like I got an email maybe like 15 days down the line saying come pick up your passport, but the whole collection of documents and justifying things took a bit longer than that. Yeah, any other visa would say you would see how long isn't like a few months? maybe, you know, I'd say like was, I'd say a month and a half. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, A lot of people like, like my husband's cousin, he applied, he has a Pakistani passport as well. So he applied from Dubai, like within five days he got it.

But if I were to really look at like, my passions and my skills into my passions, it'd be that you know, I could contribute a lot of cross cultural. Like I said, like I'd love curating like Pakistani exhibition artists exhibitions here. I'd love curating, like pop ups or stuff with like, you know, crafts and things made by underprivileged like woman in Pakistan. So I think the whole cross cultural thing really like link to art and crafts really does help me out. And then, you know, I don't know if that's a skill set, but I think I have a very creative mindset. It's like you give me something as long as you give it to me from the start of it, I will make something of it. And I think that's, that's one of the things that…I don't know if I have that cliche skill set. I've always kind of said, Well, I don't fall into that category anyway.

Like he is his family had also come a couple of years before that to settle in the kids and whatever. And then it was like they had applied as a family and by the end of I think, I think 2011-2012 they all got their passports or whatever. So the parents moved back coz there they have… my my father in law has a business back home and then and then. Well, yeah, yeah, they decided to stay.

Im like Amir, look like we have so many like there's so much culture like you know whether it comes to food or comes to traditions or folklore or whatever. He's not very proud Paksitani.

Are you hospitable? These are the things that I think comes from our culture because we as people are very hospitable. And we take care of our guests and he's always told me like I'm a hospitable as well, but he's always told me like, you know, guests whoever comes to our house…like that way you can tell the traditionalism coming in but and also the fact that when we started dating, he wasn't like he told me from the first day I'm not fooling around with you like if this works out. I want to get married to you. And I was like, okay, because guys, even in Pakistan dont say that.

I was born and this is the day that my dad was he was going through a lot of politics in terms of people and his colleagues. So he was fighting for a promotion that he was very much due for. But this day, the day of my birth, I was born as finally when he got that promotion, making him like the ambassador, like in foreign countries. So he always sees my birth as good luck. I've always been like a little spoiled dads child. So moving on from that, like if I were to go on…I wish I knew what the Arab flag looked like. This is Iraq. This is Indonesia. So my first best friend was I met… was in Indonesia. So then, leaving was sad obviously. Then we went to Islamabad which was interesting. So, we stayed like random places. Well, when my dad was doing a course and we stayed in one of those houses too long…Like, our like, container came by a container came from from Jakarta. And then we bought a house and my dad was busy like doing these courses and my mom us were like, just. like first experience in Pakistan like, our maid, like goes missing and my mom was like, but I dropped her home, like last night and she told me this is the house and like the next day the family comes to the house and they're like, like what did you do to like my daughter? She's not back home, whatever and they threatened to put it up in the newspaper or whatever. Turns out the girl herself had ran away with another guy. So that was like, obviously all this visa stuff was supported by my dad. So I don’t really know much about it. So there was this holiday without mom. It was amazing. No with dad was amazing. Yeah, mom was …all these rules back then obviously right. I remember the flag. So That's Holland, that's like legal.. like that’s weed, so Canada. Yeah its way more legal here than in Holland. There you can't smoke on the streets. Over here, like there's no, like you can order it online on the Government of Ontario Canada website…like they even have like CBD oils and stuff like that which you can tell me which which ones are good so. To be honest I'm not like so much as so much a weed person I realized so yeah i think i think i think… or maybe the strains that I've like ordered haven't been like very suitable for me but like in Pakistan whatever I used to get like cuz I love writing so get me very creative. Over here, it just gets me very like paranoid and jittery and I don't like that.  So, well I was a little upset and I think I spoke for all my family when I say this that like this is you know, home. We did there for so many years and moving from Holland to like, say like, you think about like Russia, you're like, what the hell… Where am I going? But then you know, we get there and like, you know, It's amazing. Like it's just the best. I speak Dutch but now that's going down the drain obviously because I have less people to practice with but. Im trying to draw this but its not working…St. Basil's Cathedral basically. Yeah. And the Kremlin, but I'm not I can't draw them. And then funnily enough their flag is the opposite of…So all of this was like diplomatic visa. My father retired in 2008. I'm not gonna go into the English flag cuz, yeah, England..whatever. I was living in London. It was nice. I had a lot of friends at that point who had also moved to London. So it's kind of like interesting because you know, I had a community. Its like those weighs – like justice or whatever. So this is the artist that I work with. Obviously, she doesn't look like that. But just to signify that I was curating in some point in my life. So I got a very serious or, I thought was a serious relationship in my second year like while I was in Pakistan, got my heart broken. I thought it was the end of the world but it clearly wasn't. There are many more heartbreaks after that and many more like fun times. And then we have in the middle, I think, the most important one. Like I know that’s not a maple leaf but like, Ironic, right, because I was born on 28th December. I got married on the 23rd of December. So [moving to Canada], It was a struggle. The weather was a struggle, there was loss of relationship excitement, like I said, husband traveling a lot, not ready to let go of his bachelor lifestyle habits. Now it's gone better because lot of people told him to but initially No. And then I used to be stuck in upset because I but now I found my own thing and I found my way to go through with him and how to deal with him. I know what he's tired when he wants to watch a match, when he does these things I know like the whole rhythm. So I'm not very like pushed about it. But yeah, that's, that's well, that's my very basic map, I guess. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo I suppose I'm what I'm now interested in is you're, you're like the kinds of services that you uses. I mean, this is research is also about what people do in turn. of trying to get visas. Yeah, so I suppose the two destinations that I'm interested in knowing about is London is the UK and Canada. And you said that you used a lawyer for Canada. so I mean what I'm wanting to know as any commercial services that you used okay things that you paid for all you guys had to pay for \", '', '', '', 'Su:\\tlawyer for Spousal Visa …a lot of money and then obviously there was the visa for the visa which obviously is like a visa fee. right. So that for the UK that was also student visa. Had a fee but I didn’t use a lawyer coz obviously university on my behalf had actually, and honestly, the at that point, there was a big clunk of students, in the sense that there was like you know that year… there was a big backlog and whatever people got their UK visas really late so I did miss like freshers week and stuff. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd there was University fees and like how what what sort of support systems that were available to you mean where your foot where your family paying the fees? Yeah, yeah, I was. I used to come back to Karachi, like the summer and work, like, just like gaining experience, but it was mostly like my family paying for it. ', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tSo for immigration here I had to do criminal record check. I had to do medical. I think I still have to do a few more things like to prove you know, we're married. The other day, we got a letter from a lawyer from who had gotten a letter from, from the Canadian government saying that we need to prove that we're cohabiting. Im like how do we prove that they're like. Well, basically, you know, joint bank accounts or letters that have come to your house, like addressed to you, but come to his address and that kind of stuff. I was like, Okay, fine. We'll send that over. But like, obviously, I mean, I get it, I get it from their point of view, because there's a lot of people that just get married, like, sort of have an agreement whereby they're just like, okay, I'll get married to but you know, I'm just helping you with your residency or whatever. But yes, but we gave them a lot of proof of the fact that like, I remember my husband writing like four pages of like, how we met, how this happened. Even then they had like questions like, Okay, what was the restaurant where the first date was? What was this? What was that? So they were very thorough and so despite that, like im quite surprised  they still think someone would’ve made that up, but maybe it's maybe it's just protocol? I don't know. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd I mean, how do you also look? I mean, I suppose now I'm just gonna ask you a moral sort of an emotional question or Yeah, mental kind of a question where How do you feel about being on this dependent visa? I mean, considering that your visa depends upon your husband and marriage?\", '', '', '', \"Su:\\tIt's stressful? Yeah, very stressful. Like, I can't wait to reach to the mark where, like, you know, I'm on my own kind of thing and like, it's not dependent, like, in any way, like, you know, it's a very insecure time, you know, like your dependence is completely on somebody else. Financially also, and as well as, you know, country wise or living wise. That's never ever happened with me. So, I think that that is a that's a tough like. These are tough emotions to juggle sometimes. I've always been this kind of like independent person and then you turn around you suddenly become utterly dependent on someone else. Its like ha ha, joke's on you, kind of thing. Well, I think the first few months like you were kind of like, okay, let's just go with however it is. Yeah, he was a bachelor. So he was like, Okay, we'll buy groceries whenever and neither was really cared. But because I was like, I was so used to a house that was systematic and he was so used to living as a bachelor, that I wanted systems like groceries every two weeks, I wanted to cook coz I like cooking like, I wanna have meals ready, and like stuff like that. So, those are the things I had to like systemize and then obviously, like, anything I needed to get or whatever, like, although, like I try very hard to like pull out my savings or whatever and do part time jobs here and there. Obviously he still supports like, like, anything that I need, right? Like, you know, like give me a certain amount of whatever it is so that I can buy this or that.. So even though like I would not be on this way, I wouldn't be on the street anyway. But like, it's just one of those things where you're like, I'd rather know when this is happening and when it's going to be fine, like, as opposed to be like in the dark because I don't like uncertainty. That’s it. And it's also, I’ll tell you what, I've never lived in a country as an immigrant. I've always lived and my dad used to always say this, and Im like dad “That's such a wrong thing to say”… like don't use the word “immigrant” in the negative connotation, but he's like, I'm right. You realize that when you move there, that in your life you did have like a privileged status, whether you liked it or not, and then in Pakistan you lived at home. Now suddenly, you're basically like, gonna be a barista at Starbucks, you're gonna have problems getting your mind down, right? Rather than thinking I'm still living in that sphere of mind. For me. That's, that was the biggest challenge to overcome. And I think I've overcome that really, but like it's still every day, it's like, okay, you're not starting from if you were at level 10 in Pakistan, you're not starting from level 10, you probably started with level two. Yeah. And that is sort of, it hits your self esteem, it hits your dynamics with your husband or whatever, because, you know, like, it just does, like, even indirectly, its got nothing to do with anyone else. But it's just like that. And I have been financially like, I lived with my parents, whatever. So as far as like bills and stuff goes, I had like no idea… but in terms of like my own financial stuff, like things I wanted to buy or the things I wanted to do, I never asked my parents. So it's it's challenging because I've been like, not that I have to ask my husband for money. He will just like transfer it every month or whatever but, but you know getting there it takes time to get there because it's awkward. You're like, he's my boyfriend you're dating, everything's fun suddenly it comes down to money. And then when I researched it was like, a big like a big issue between couples and I was like, okay, there's the other issue I remember we were joking about this when we were dating was like two two big issues in a marriage. And then one is cleanliness and I remember dating sitting there laughing and saying what do you mean cleanliness? How is that even an issue that leads to divorce or whatever. And and he was like, I don't know, I'm just reading this off a website and the second one is budgeting. And I was like oh Don't worry, we won't have issue with either but like I here now and I have issues with both [laughs]. My husbands not the most cleanest person… he's clean but he's messy. Yeah, he's hygienic. You know, he's he's like, Okay throw the shoes here, the socks here.  And the the thing is it's so funny because I was living at home I didn't really care like I kept my room like clean or whatever but like I wouldn't have cared if someone came to my house and put their boots here or there but now I'm just like “tomorrow I'm gonna wake up I know I have to do it”. So like it just gets me antsy and irritated. And obviously factors like that wouldn't be there if I was like working safe say, if I work from like nine to like six seven, I wouldn’t give a shit about like what's happening like…That's also one of the things I that's why I want to get to work so fast although could take a longer sabbatical, and do part time gigs, but I think one of the reasons for mental stability will also be getting back to work. An idle mind is the devil's workshop this basically it. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd in terms of like these part time gigs that you're doing, what are you doing? \", '', '', '', \"Su:\\tMostly like brand ambassadors stuff. So right now working for this thing called, there's a magazine called refinery 29. But we know it like they're they're doing these pop ups all over this a fourth year doing these art installations. What it is, is like an experience-based thing. So like they're curating 29 rooms with different experiences for people go there. So, there's like artists, they've been doing this in Florida, Atlanta, and like, a couple of places, and this is the first time they doing in Toronto at the exhibition place. So they’ve picked all Canadian local artists, and they're doing like very like performance art. And it's very interactive. So if you're like a visitor and you bought a ticket, you're not just standing here looking at the museum, but you're interacting with the Art. And so I'm just like, working.. I don't know exactly what my role is till the training is tomorrow, but I'm gonna be like one of their brand ambassadors. Probably make contacts and stuff during that time. But, yeah, it's like 12 hours a day work, but I think I need that. Like, honestly networking, you know, it's like, it's weird because it's not difficult. It's actually one of the easier countries to network. But I just feel like because of the closeted environment that we actually experienced in Paksitan where a girl goes up to a guy like gives out like a visitor cards, like “oh, okay, you know”, so that I think that's kind of been drilled into our like, my system. So like, the whole networking thing is like, like my parents. They’re like “what's networking?...just like send CV’s” Im like dad these guys like networking… it is 80% of the job. The other day I went to this NGOs random like annual general meeting and my husband was like why are you going to the annual general meeting? so random…I was like I'm going to go and try making contacts. After the meeting was done I walked up the CEO and I'm like, Look, I like to introduce myself very briefly coz she obviously didn’t have time. She's like, Look, let me just give you my card and email me and we'll see what positions we have and where we can put you for that was like, you know, like a step to get out. But I think most of the time I'm so stuck in my comfort zone. It's a lot of laziness and like it's, kind of like futility and actions like… Okay, so what if I get this I'm never gonna be as senior as big as I was in Pakistan. So like, I'm gonna have to work what 10 years more to get the level that I was in Pakistan. Its ridiculous. Even though that may not be the truth. But I don't you know, that's what I mean. That self defeating thought kind of puts me back on doing stuff. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd in terms of your migration itself was tell me the role of your parents and your social connections. So friends, family community that they played in your migration, or was there? Was there any role in there? ', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tYeah In terms of authenticating that, Oh, yeah. You know, our daughter, was in a relationship with him and they were dating and then she got married and that kind of thing, but otherwise not really. My mom kind of knew, like I told her first because we had… my cousin was getting married in San Francisco, and he was just insisting on meeting my family, and he was my mom's brother's daughters wedding, so my first cousin. And so I said, Okay, fine. You want to move my family from San Francisco and he'd come and then from then on, it was like, no going back kind of thing. But he met my dad like later that year. So Ive never like introduced any guys to my dad, unless the guy has been serious about his intentions and he was very serious about it. So, I guess that was that was that. In terms of dating and stuff, so like my mom would know… But like, I never liked sort of introduced them to my dad, so then he was like okay that's the real deal, you know. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd in terms of the…are you are you sort of interested in immigration policies and migration policies generally?', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tFor sure. I really want to work with immigrants and refugees. My dream was actually to like move to…. before I met Amir, My dream was to like move to Europe and work with refugees and sort of work in in terms of policy making for assimilation for refugees or refugees or immigrants because I think that is….and honestly in Toronto as well people say oh community centres, YMCA, employment Canada blah, blah, blah. But honestly, that doesn't help very much. It's not about Okay, I want to come and get a job immediately. It's just about like, if, if I've just flown in or whatever, from Tunisia or wherever, I didn't speak a word of English and whatever, like, how can you help me in the immediate level to get me assimilated to my culture, to make sure that I live in a place which has people from my culture, like I've always been interested in, like, migration and like, settlement and, and immigration and just general sort of like, you know, cultural assimilation, and I feel there's a big lacking of that, no matter how many centers they have. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tRight. So you're more interested in the sort of NGO space work in migration? Have you sort of do you look into migration policies and stuff as well? \", '', '', '', 'Su:\\tNot really, not really.

Like, I as a lot of people for my like, for advice for me, but no, like, I think it's only been nine months. So, I guess nobody has come up to me. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd I suppose what I want to now know is the role of technology and you're in You're such a new sort of moving to Canada and even moving to London, I was I would ask maybe, how did you do conduct online research? Did you look at online resources? And again, broadly, as well, how did you use technology, I suppose even maintaining that long distance relationship. \", '', '', '', \"Su:\\tTo be honest, I've been very bad at that. I didn't maintain technology or say, you know, you'd imagine like, you know, somebody who's moving to Canada to be like, okay, let's read up about politics. And let's read up about what's happening day to day and I'd say only the last month I've started getting more involved, the elections coming in and everyone's talking about it. And I'm like, okay I need to know what's going on or like sports for that matter, and that kind of stuff. So I was never very like… London's different because I was more politically aware because it's more globalised.  But in terms of use of technology to help me out Absolutely not. I just didnt. I think every big change in my life has been blindness and aloofness. If I were to put it that way, every single decision that I have made has been just on, you know, just just a leap of faith like really… Ive never really been like, Okay, I'm gonna research this or whatever it's been like someone's given me advice. I like the advice, Ill go for it or whatever. But now like, as I've grown up and realized several mistakes I might have made doing that, I try to remain more informed and I try to research more. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tBut yeah, maintaining your relationship with your boyfriend or your husband now. How did you do that on my long distance? Like what were you sort of what are the tools that ', '', '', '', 'Su:\\tlike WhatsApp, Facetime – that kinda stuff.

I want to work in the art sphere I also want to work. I also want to like this new thing that I have in mind. I want to become a naturopath… I want to work with organic medicine, with aroma therapy with oils because I that's benefited me so I suffer from anxiety and depression seasonally. So, both of these things have helped me a lot …eating clean, organic and also like a lot of lateral movement therapy essential oils and just tinctures and whatever it is like I've benefited from them a lot. So I really want to do something that would help other people also do that. I want to link that to mental health somehow. So I've been reading up a lot about mental health and about, you know, different therapy procedures and how to do that. I'm not a certified therapist so obviously no one can take me seriously in that way. So basically that’s also something I want to do, but I also like I think my main goal in life in whatever factor would be to help people, whether that's mental health or that's, you know physical disabilities or volunteering at you know, an old people's home because I know I just had this certain like, obviously, I've never been old before and I've never felt the feeling of loneliness of not having my children because I don't have children but there's something that pulls me to connect to people. Whether they're orphans or old people, so there's anything I can do for them in any way id be grateful. But anyway, as it comes to be a very practical stance, I need to have more investment capital to stand and say, this is what I do for a living and maybe one day that’ll translate to something of my own. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what about like other sort of goals? And I mean, do you want to buy a house? For example? Do you want to have children?

So, I would say, my husband the complete opposite He's like, now we've got an apartment. We have a house. Now we have to buy this know we have to buy that, and it's always about that. I'm just like, just relax and enjoy the moment. Like, I'm not I'm not worried if I don't have a house. Kids are not my agenda anytime soon. But I'd like to have then for sure.  Yeah, I think I think right now what I'm working on a lot is personal growth. Yeah, like emotional regulation, and you know, stuff that there's a very interesting therapy procedure called dialectical behavioural therapy. And there's a lot of workbooks available for that. And I think I'm working on that I'm working on just, I am inherently a very sensitive person. So I'm working on just sort of growing a thicker skin and just kind of like accepting situations as they are. And I think the self loathe, unless I know do that, I cant be good enough for anything or anyone. Whether that's a job or relationship or kids or so have you whatever. So the focus I tried, I'm trying to go and it's very difficult because I'm not a every time I tried the focus to go on me, I keep thinking I'm a selfish person. I should be doing stuff for other people because that's how I am. But I've just sort of pushed myself said no, no, unless you cant do stuff for yourself, you can’t pour from an empty kart. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat do you feel about your map?', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tI think it's very likely could be… could be more like elaborate and more like, smart creative, but it's just that I just. On a journey level, I think its fabulous. I think I've had like the best of a lot of worlds. And I'm very blessed to have had this opportunity like, you know, success of my own, but like, it's been great, like, you know, like the moving to Pakistan bit was was a little difficult after university, but I think that really, really helped me it's like, move on to this level where I'm at right now. So I would say this present. It's really all of that has helped me to move on to this level. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWould you consider migration elsewhere?', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tI'd say maybe UK or North America. Say California. A - better weather, B - Just, you know, I don't know, I just feel like, you know, I love this city and everything. It's great. But I think I struggle with people's mindsets a lot, because I think people are very opinionated over here. But they try not to be.. They try to be very proper. And I think that gets to me, because it's like, if you have an opinion, just put it off. You know, like, instead of, like, sort of, if I, you always feel like… “oh my god, Did I say something wrong?” Did I say something culturally inappropriate or religiously inappropriate, or did I say something about something about someone’s weight or making innuendo? Yeah, and I'm just like, you know, theres too many like self righteous people, at least the people I've come across, in the sense that they're always like, okay, we'll fat shaming and there shouldnt be thin shaming, then there's that then there's that… and you're like, Okay, what do I say? How can I have a conversation with you? Like I just sit there and be like, I am not okay with this, and I'm not okay with that. I have an opinion. But I respect you having your own opinion.

So she was like... she said he lives in Canada, and you know, he has a similar situation as mine again, he was divorced also. Love marriage and then got divorced. He have three older kids again, and then. And I have two older kids and I was divorced also so but I was like, it's not gonna work. You know, he lives in Canada, and it was a love marriage and then divorce and here, so, friends were more like, no, he should talk to him. So I was like Okay. So I talked to him, and we clicked. We clicked on our first conversation, After that I was a mom that never texted. And suddenly I was texting him. I was texting, like 100 messages a day. Yeah, we just clicked. You know, it was the same jokes and we had the same situation with our divorce. He had a hard divorce and I had a very hard divorce. Kids were depending on me, my kids were on me, his kids were on him. So then that, we understand that, we had the similar stories. Yeah. So basically that and then, yeah, with him, I laughed more. I was myself. You know, usually I didn't know if I could talk to anyone. I didn't know what to talk, you know. Because we're so sheltered. with him. I was more of myself. And so we, so he used to come every month. His company in US. He lives in Montreal. So he visits his company in Chicago every month.  And then from there, he would come and see me.

His sister lives here, but she wouldn't have able to take care of them by herself. So, I moved here left my job. I was working for 22 years. Yeah. And yeah. So that was understood that he wouldn’t move.  And how was that for your family like your children as well or your other family that you were deciding to move? What role did they have to play that this.. Yeah, it was. It was very interesting. My kids, even though they are older, and they were the one who pushed me to get married because they moved out. You know I was living on my own and the cat, and you know us didn't have every time tornado or hurricane come you know they are more worried about me so they were pushing me “No mom you need to get married and it was funny because I would say between all three of us Let's see who will get married first” laughs. It would be like you know somebody would say, you know, you should think about yourself you know your kids will find somebody but you need to think about it then I was thinking okay, you know, I need to find people and you know that butterflies was in my head and then somebody will say “no, no, you don't think about you… think about your daughter. She needs to get married.” So in my head I was like I am an older person I need to think about my daughter. But my kids were very much supportive. They love Ijhtaba. My daughter talks to him about, about any mashwara [advice] and everything, you know, even though they were both were fine, but yeah, it was hard for them. It was hard for them. And I'm finding out now that my daughter when I was married, and I was moving, I was selling my stuff. She just... she was working at the time, but she started acting up. Yeah, she would not let me hug her.  Like she was angry all the time. Because, you know, it was her house and now she doesn't have a house there. Yeah, I'm, I'm the house and I'm not there. So at that point, I was realizing but I was planning to move here. I and I was going through my own emotions. When I was getting married. I didn't think I didn't sleep for like three months. You know because I'm Leaving my job and I'm leaving my house… So she got into that and, and for months, she would not let me hug her. She just closed in. And I didn't know what to do because I was moving and then when I was moving, she left her job and she went to Europe for three months. Backpacking. I was kind of worried but then she is very strong headed and she has a good head on her shoulders. I trust her completely you know. But there was so much going on.. so many pieces were moving that I couldn't even you know, focus on one thing, but she left for three months. She quit her job. And between that time I moved to Montreal. She came back to Montreal to me. And then she was just depressed. She didn't have a job, she spent her savings and it was and this is not her house, and before I was completely hers, but now I have a husband. You know, so he needs as much attention as she does. And so she would not get out of the bed and then after literally yell and say, you know, you need to do something. And I know she wanted to stay here with me, but she couldn't because she couldn’t work. She doesn't have her health care. She was getting depressed and depressed, and depressed. It was very hard. It was very hard. And his kids were, even though they were older, but the other piece was with me that I'm here in their house. Its not my house. So the next morning when I moved here, I was like, I sit on the sofa and I'm like, Okay, now what do I do? I feel like I'm a guest, because this is not my house. But what do I do now? You know, things were not in right places, you know because they were just living. So it's just like, but I couldn't change things like this because I have to still feel that it's their house. I am the one who's coming from outside and then my daughter came and she's depressed. And so, yeah, I mean, it took about a couple of months for her to just move. She went back to Jami in Chicago. They both start fighting because it was just a roommate situation, you know, they she, she was just not…she became a little difficult and as well Jami became difficult and I was in the middle and I got this new house going on…New family, but then she found a job so she was okay. And then I recently found out that Jami was not Okay. He felt like I had abandoned him. So… and I just found out recently…he's seeking therapy. Naz is also seeking therapy and they want me to go for therapy also. Theyre like mom, it's really good because you gotta go you know, get your issues out because when the things happen I was always taking care of them, you know like the divorce. And instead of having time for my depressio. I was taking care of them. So they both are fine now. But in our therapy is they tell them to you have to go and confront people…tell them what's not right with you. So he did, he confronted me. (laughs) and, and I could you know, it was a time when he felt that I was not there, but I was there but he was so depressed that he didn't see me in the house and I was so depressed that I didn’t see him in the house when we were going through the divorce. And he, he told me that, you know, he felt like I abandoned him, but I was like, No I didn't abandon you. We were just too depressed to see each other. He's okay. But we figured out Naz was always the one who would scream. “I want this… why you're not looking at me.” You know?. And Jamal was always quiet. So, he bottled up, and I was thinking he's okay, we have to handle Naz. She's the crazy one. But apparently, she's not the crazy one. We all know we were the crazy ones, we were bottling up everything but anyway. So yeah, it was. It was amazing journey. So he's okay now because he just let it out. And I'm glad that he did that because if he didn't tell me what was bothering you him about me, then I would not know this all my life and I didn't know. I would not know why he's upset. Yeah, at least now he give me a chance to explain myself to say, you know, this is what happened to me, you know? \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tNo, no, no, that's all right. That's totally fine and those issues I mean, did they also are they in touch with their dad as well? And\", '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYeah, they are in touch with their dad but they try not to. So it's, it's hard for them because he he is very difficult person that he doesn't think about other person. He keeps telling Naz that she needs to get married because she's getting old. Shes 28…And nobody will marry her. And, you know, she's losing her. You know, her time to get married. So you will find people, kids, boys, that just want a Green Card and just want to to move here. So he would tell them no see, your time is going you will never get married because you're old, you’re getting too old.  So they don't talk to him. They don't need this.. They still call him to ask him how he's doing. He had two bypasses. He almost was going away and then we came back. He's going very strong now so so yeah. You know, they don't talk to him like Jami had confronted me. He did not confront his dad. you know, and I'm fine. So I think that he took twice on me because he couldn't, you know, yeah, the other part. So, which is okay, you know, but he would get worried about his dad if you hear tornados coming or hurricane came. Yeah. And he would be like, Oh, I have to talk to pap, you know, see how he's doing. So the connection is still there.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo dad's also based in Houston?\", '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYeah. He has remarried. And it was funny because I met his wife. And she is very simple, very simple woman, you know, and she told me, she said, you know, kind of like “aap to janti hain na” you know.. yeah. She was, she was trying to tell me that she's in trouble with him, right, like I was. But she's not telling me in complete words. what she's saying that you know how it is, You understand, kind of like, Yeah, I was so sad because I couldn't do anything for her like, yeah, you know, I understand. So, He's married. He's in Houston.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay. And so you the first time you move to the States, it was because of a marriage visa as well. So you kind of got married. Have you moved there?', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYes. I had a marriage reason. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it's it's kind of interesting because one husband asked me American nationality, the other one is getting me Canadian nationality. Laughs \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tWell, if that's it, then that's it. Right? Like what are you gonna? Yeah. Okay, so. All right, I suppose. Let's talk about your family back. Do you have mom and dad back in Pakistan? Your own parents?\", '', '', '', 'Me:\\tYeah. Yeah, I have my mom and dad both. My mom is a US citizen. Oh, great. Okay. My dad is not because he has remarried. So he have two wives. We are from the older wife, not older – the first one. So he, my mom is with him now because he had a stroke so he couldn’t move his body right. He can only move his hand and he cant walk. But his second wife with who he was all that time passed away oh so then then you know after he had a stroke my mom kind of went back to him.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tright okay and when was the last time you visited them in Pakistan?', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tOh my god long time ago I don't go to Pakistan that often I only been there twice. So the last time I think is was 2000. that's a long time ago a long time. Yeah, my father was, you know, fine that that time and my mom she comes and goes so see her more often. I haven't seen my dad yet and talk to him on the phone here and there.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAwesome. And let's just talk about your I suppose now your skills that the research is about and so, and I when I asked about skills, what are your skills? I don't just mean professional skills. I also mean life skills, you know, like what, what makes you somebody who's skilled, how can you contribute your skills to this country?\", '', '', '', \"Me:\\tSo in the US, I was working as a, I started my job as a pharmacy technician, I have a Pharmacy technician certificate and I have an associate degree. Just a general one, you know, I took some classes at a community college. So then I started working as a pharmacy technician and that was my first job ever, never worked before ever. And it was Baxter I was a pharmacy technician and then there we had pharmacist and technicians. And manager, and General Manager. And what happened that we had a FDA audit and it didn't go well, because the paperwork was not completed. You know, nobody was doing sign up and nobody was actually checking. They were just doing things. So we had a big fine with FDA and at that time they needed a person to see paperwork from outside eyes - not to be involved in the room or anybody. Before the drug goes to the patient. So I used to when I was a technician, in my break, I used to ask my manager to give me filing, you know, something that I do differently. And, I don't know, it's, it was just me. And then they thought about me, you know, so I interviewed for that position. It was a documentation clerk, and they hired me, and it was very interesting because one day I was with the pharmacist and the technician and I was working under the pharmacist, under their license. So they say yes, and then I start, you know, filling up drugs and this and that. The next day, I was a got this position. So I was sitting outside and checking their batch record, oh, telling them that I'm not producing this batch because you didn't sign for area clearance, or you didn't sign who performed it? And they would be like, no, because, you know, you know, they did it. They just forgot to send I'm like, I'm not signing this paperwork, because if I sign it, then it becomes my responsibility. And then like, No, you don't know and under white guys, you know, big guys, and I'm this Pakistani. Laughs. And I would cry and then the manager would literally yell at my head, you know, they would just go against me, you know, but I'm like, No, I can't you know, because this is my position. I can't release this batch and I would keep batch close to my, my desk and I'm like, No, I'm not. So yeah, I bumped a lot of heads and I we used to cry, because, you know, I wanted to do that, you know, I couldn't release it. And, and later on I mean, they they started and my manager was not actually in Houston, my manager was in Chicago. So it's not like somebody was protecting me. I had to protect myself. I had to be the guy. So then, yeah. Later on, they were all they understood, because when FDA comes in, they are not the one who's explaining. I'm right in front of them. Like I'm sitting with you. And I'm explaining to you why I signed this paperwork and why I think this batch was correct. So at that point, I realize that I can fight you know, I can be you know, I can put my foot down and I never knew I had that part. Anyway, because in Pakistan, my education was not that I did Inter. And since my, there were issues with my mother and father and my father got remarried and all that, and there were seven of us. somewhere we got forgotten, you know. So, you know, at that point, I was an authority, even though I was just pharmacy technician, but I was authority with the pharmacist because I can't rely, you know, it's up to me to release the batch. So I realized that part in me, and then they they got used to me. And then it was funny because I was not a manager, and the manager would come as a quality manager over me, but they would be so scared to get out of their office and knock on the door because they have to, you know, confront people. And I would be still the one who’s on the floor. But I felt that I felt that even though and I worked very hard, I worked two shifts, I worked there 10 hours, I would not get paid for 10 hours. But since I started the quality, it was my baby. So I was kind of like, you know, and the managers, they would just sit in their office and would not come by the manager would just sit and sleep in his chair because the light will go off on its own because this had motion detector on it. And he would be sleeping and I'm the one who's facing the pharmacist and the manager, the audits and everything. So at that point, I was working too many hours and since I was having issues at home with my husband, that was kind of my refuge. And I remember I bought books from library saying how to handle a difficult situation because I was facing that at work. And my husband, my ex would get mad. He thought I was trying to control him. So, you know, so I was dealing with that part, you know, and he got jealous of me because I was not having college degree. I was doing so good. And he was not doing that good. So I was kind of like, you know, in that situation. And then I mean, I did spend a lot of time at work. I did night shifts, I did morning shifts, so I would do two shifts at one time while I was going through my divorce also. And I know I neglected kids but that's the only thing I knew, you know. And I know my company used me a lot because they didn't pay me overtime. They were like go your supervisor you supposed to do that. But then I later much later on I realized that no, the other supervisors were getting overtime. I would spend weekends there. You know, I would just go there at night and make sure everything is okay. Yes, I'm Who's facing FDA and I know they used me and I know I did neglected my kids at that point but that was kind of my refugee, you know, refuge kind of thing that I was somebody there. So then, um, so I always wanted to, to do a business. I would always think okay if I… if I didn't have work, you know I would do a business and with 22 years of service, I had 401k plan I had stock I had a house. Financially, I was okay. My kids went to college… they both finished college because I was like you do whatever you want to do but just finish college because I knew I didn't have college I would work twice as much as the person. So thank God even though our situation was not great. But my both kids Finished college. And I think that was the motivation to get out of the house. So I had, I had management skills even though I didn't have a manager title, but I never had manager, So I was the one who's managing a lot of different personalities, you know, so and then so then when I moved here I was Yeah, I was thinking what am I gonna do? Okay. Part of me wants to just retire. you know, because I work 22 years. 22 years.Yeah, very hard job. Part of me just wanted to relax. You know, because I was always I used to I remember I used to walk. And I would never know how I made it to point a to point b because I used to walk fast. Yes, with the FDA. You know, you have to make copies you have to, you know, you have to be like this. And my mind, start moving very fast. So it took me a long time to calm my mind down because I'm it's always on. So now when I'm here so I do bring a lot of different skills. I never really realized that I have different skills I thought okay I'll get a job as a quality or in pharmacy or something. I came here and I wanted to relax the first year but the language was the main thing here that you have to have a French. I started taking French classes 2016 …completely boggle my mind because it was just like vern, grammar, and going back to the school and you have no idea what is the chair the teachers are talking is in French and I'm like, okay, explain to me this and they're explaining to me in French. I don't understand them. So it took a couple of months and then I took time off from that because I guess I don't need French, you know, because I'm in West Island. And then a friend of mine sent me this job posting at Simwa. Simwa is a government organization and they give French classes and job assessment for the immigrants in West Island. So she sent me this job posting that they are hiring recruiters to recruit students from, from South Asian community for French classes. So now, you know, I got this posting. So then I got into that job mode, you know.. I used to do interviews, I used to take interviews. So I'm like, okay, you know, so I did, went and did the interview. And they were saying that you don't know French. I'm like, well, you don't need French. Because the people who I'm talking to, they don't understand French. You're looking for somebody like me, just recently come and came and don't, you know, need to take French classes and I know why they are not taking French classes. So, you know, that's how I can connect with them. So they hired me, I did really good interview. I convinced them. I was like, okay, you know, I would tell them. If you have kids, and you don't know French, and your kids will know French, they will have secret language. Your daughter will talk on the phone in French and you have no idea where she's going and meeting. They hired me on the spot. So I got this position and others. And I didn't realize I always thought I didn't know how to talk. I mean, I'm talking now. But I didn't know that. I can talk to strange people because now I'm in that mode that this is my job. I have to provide, you know, in 16 weeks, I was supposed to give them 100 students. I give them 100 students in one month because what I realized is, with South Asian community, they're scared. So you go, you tell them they have no idea what's out there. They have no idea it's free. You know? They're like, Oh, it's free. I don't have to pay anything. Yeah. So then I got more. You know, I went to Mandir, I went to Masjid I went to go Gurudwara, went to the Buddhist temple, I went everywhere, you know. And, and this part of me, I'm a more of open minded with religion, I always find very peaceful in all different religions. And there was my plus point, because there was other person with me, and she would hesitate to go to Mandir. But I would be going to church and attending the things and go to, you know, Mandir, and I was handing out flyers and I remember in lunchtime and there was a guy who asked me, he said, Oh, so what part of India you're in I'm like, I'm from Pakistan. And everybody turned around and looked at me. But no, they were very nice. Yeah. So um, so yeah, so I didn't realize that I have that. And since I had a background in quality, I was. I did hundred it's not like Okay, I'm done. You know, in one month you got you, but I did, which they didn't have and now they're realizing that part, and I am very happy about it because they should realize it. But what I did was a student that I brought in for them. I started tracking them, right. Okay. What class they are in, you know, if they left Why did they left? Yeah. So they, they had no idea so I propose to them. I said, You know what, I've got those people here. I need to know where they are because if audit comes in they should know what happened to them. There was a government officer who came in who wanted to see the program. So, he met us and I had no idea about French Okay, I mean, he this guy was there for two hours. My manager was there for supervisor everybody speak in French. Yeah, I have no idea what they said two hours I was sitting. Yeah, after that. And my manager, she would be like, Oh, you know what he said, right. I was like, I don’t know what he said. I was so mad. I was so like, handicapped. You know. Anyway, uh, my contract ended with them. I mean, till the end, I was just giving them you know, that whole sheet that I've made in English and I give them all their registration forms around every couple of them I couldn't find so I emailed to everybody. So, I left. They didn't rehire me because I didn't know French. But now I'm still in touch with them. And now I, I've, they've told me that now the government is asking them to give them all the registration information about the students what I was giving to them, but they have no idea. So, um, so but then so once that happened I was like okay, everything on the side, I have to learn French, so I'm taking full time French classes. So, and then the friend of mine I told her about simwa recruiting so what are my skills in recruiting. So she…she asked me to recruit for her. She works as a director… as a director is for agency called a microcredit Montreal. So what they do is they provide microcredit for new businesses. And they are giving workshops for women to become an entrepreneur. So she said, Could you do that for me, for me and, you know, recruit students so I can come in and give classes here in Montreal. I said, Okay, so she's paying for my time I'm doing part time for her. And this is what I do. I go around and I to church to organizations and I talk about you know, what this is, how important it is for women to be independent even do a part time job or you know, business. And I think it's good for me because I wanted to a business but I don't know how so this workshop will be good. So um, so yeah, that's so my skills would be management skill. I'm very good in managing people. Organizing, making sure procedures are followed. Communication. That's my story strong I can I can, you know, in my French class, I was telling them about the microcredit Montreal program and I got about six people signed up. Six people signed up. So far. I have 10. She told me that she needs six for her to start the class. So, I have done I need to get some more because January's the class time. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tNo, no, it's good. It's good. This is really good. Alright, so we'll go into the mapping part now so that we can get started. So you can draw this like I showed you examples, however you like. I will ask you the question. And each question that I asked you needs to be represented on the map. So normally, people do it on one sheet of paper, but you can take more paper if you want to know I'm sorry to keepIt's not it's totally fine. I am. This is the recording. I mean, this is all recording and this is really good. So it's good. Don't even worry about it. Okay, so me about all of the visas that you were ever on. Now, and I'm not and I'm not talking about visit visas or wherever you probably visited in your case, I suppose I'm interested in the US and the\", '', '', '', 'Me:\\tyou know what? I was on visit visa. From, from Pakistan to US. Also? Yeah,', '', \"so that's one visit visa. And then we got married Pakistan. Okay living. So Pakistan is one. And left Pakistan and to 1987 Yeah. So 1987 to 2016 Okay. All right. And then I was here in Montreal 2016 to present. This one I got my immigration while I was in us. Okay, so you already got your PR Yes, I came on my PR. Here I came to the US on visitor visa. Then we got married and then we converted to marriage visa. That you would you then converted to a marriage visa right. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tYeah.

And what about your current husband has he been living here all his life as well or he came here with his family or', '', '', '', 'Me:\\the came in when he was married.

Well, you're saying that. Okay, let's talk about commercial services. This is probably going to be in the most recent case. Right. Okay. What sort of services did you use that you had to pay for? So think about lawyers agents?\", '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYeah. So we paid to lawyer. A lot of money. It was a lot lot but I think it was $5000. She helped us getting our application in there with the government, and just getting me a PR…making sure that my process went smooth because I got my PR in six months. It changed that I got it with my PR quickly. Okay. But we could have done it on our own. It would have been easy process and not that much money but we were kind of scared that might, you know, the way things were going because Trump was coming as a president and we just didn't want to, we want to make sure that things went smooth. So, we thought it's better to get a lawyer. We don't it's not like delay in the process. And we didn't do this form. We did that form kind of thing. So that's why\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, so you got a lawyer? Yeah. Any other services that you paid for any consultants or document translation services or language test or any anything that you may have paid for?', '', '', '', 'Me:\\tNo. Medical. We paid for Medical. I had to do a medical test. Yeah, I have to do medical tests. It was part of it.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tRight. Okay. And, uh, tell me a little bit about this lawyer as well. How did you find the lawyer and what sort of documentation Did you provide to the lawyer?', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tWe found this lawyer here. Ijhtaba found it – my husband and - The lawyer, we provide the education like we're going to school, this my certificate. My passport, marriage documents would be one thing that we provide her that and…yes, the full… how, how did we meet? What restaurants we went to, where what was the first time we met? And what did we say to each other gifts, any gifts we have given to each other. So, we are I remember taking pictures of that. How many times he had come and visit me. So, we had to, you know, the itinerary, print out all of those. How many times I went there. Even though when she did her, she documented everything. And then she sent us. She sent us the whole thing to sign and my husband just signed off but then when I got to read do it, there was so many mistakes. So, the dates were not right. And you know, because I have a quality mindset, just like okay, I cant just sign this one. I got to make sure that everything is fine. And it didn't match. I could have written better. Yeah, but yeah, so those dates we have to provide, birth certificate. I had to provide my birth certificate. It was so funny because I couldn't find my birth certificate. So I had to provide birth certificate I remember that. I didn't I didn't know what happened to my birth certificate. So now because now the whole process has changed now there's some some kind of NADRA, some kind of organisation. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tcan you tell me about technology? So how do you use technology in your migration process? So for example, a lot of', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tso Yeah, a lot of technology. So we used Viber. Yes, we use fiber because that's the and we were so glad we had Vibber because we would text each other so many times call each other so many times. Emails… we used email also. Email. Yeah. So those were the two things that we used. Texting - viber for texting. And this is to mainly stay in touch with each other. I used Facebook. Yeah, we used Facebook also. Umm, yeah how cold it is. Yeah. Because I had no idea. I've never seen that cold before, and all really doesn't get this cold. Okay, Houston. You know how it is right now? I'm saying that's our cold. This is December, January. Yeah, that's it. So I had no idea and I remember I google Yes, I did Google shoes. Because he told me snow boots. And I was like yes I have my long boots and I'm okay. But he's like, No, that’s not gonna go. You need snow boots. So we Google that. es. So we move on to that goes on the map. And then some snow jacket no and shoes and. It was funny because I could not imagine you know that people wear those shoes I couldn't imagine in cities you know you look at those shoes and you think of okay, like Alaska…that's the thing comes to your mind. Like Igloo. I mean, it looks magical. I love it. It looks magical but my God, you know, you just…like the heavy jacket and then boots snow boots heavy ones, then hat, scarf, like going out you need at least five minutes to get ready you know, I mean thinking making yourself okay I gotta get out you know I have to wear all this.. and then coming back in you just have a lot of things to take out. It was funny because I went to us like I went to his friend's house for in Toronto in April. They did my dawat, you know, so I went to a friend's house and all of a sudden I see these Pakistani ladies, theyre all wearing shalwar kameez and you know, and I'm like, Oh, that's nice with the really pretty shoes, the sandals and everything. So when they were leaving and outside in the Snow. So when they were leaving, they took the shoes out, the sandals out, and they put it in the bag. And then they've got the snow boots and they put those on. They all carry their shoes with them. So that was a new thing. So that was the same month I was going back. So that April here it was snowing. In Huston it's April… there's no snow there's like, summer is coming right. So I was going back to Huston and as like, okay. It's going to be from airport to the plane so I don't even have to go outside. So I go in my chappals/sandals. So then I'm at the airport, Toronto airport. And they say, okay, the plane is ready. But it's 10 o'clock at night, but we have to go walk outside. And I'm looking at my chappals and its snowing outside, and I couldn't believe that in April it snows here. So then I walked into the snow here. So yeah, so then I walked in. I was moving this guy's arm because he was like, I'm gonna slip slip, just hold me and then went outside stairs to the plane and then went it was.. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tYeah, I think I'll miss the big snow part. I think I'm gonna go before that. OK, so now on the map. Oh, so let's talk about social connections. So before you moved to Montreal Did you have any friends or family I mean your as your husband was here but friends family greater community that that you had here anybody that you could come in? I mean did you have to make friends did you have to make friends\", '', '', '', \"Me:\\tI had to make friends. In Montreal I didn't know anyone. It was very different because when I moved to America I had kids there so you you kind of connect with the people who have kids right? So you connect with everybody? Yeah you just like you know make 100 friends there because they all have kids and you're just like going you know, doing dawat and all that, picnics because of the kids. Here I don't have kids. So I have to make friends and I got to used to in Huston - having my own group I didn't have a lot of friends then either either later on in life, you pick and choose and you just Just have to small group of people. You know, and that's it, you just meet. So. And here, I didn't know how to make friends. And there in Houston, I had my family, my six siblings, so I didn't really need to. If I want I could just go to their house. Here, I had no idea what to do. I had no idea what to do. And I was…the only people I know is my husband and his sister. And my husband knew someone and we would go you know, but he was, he was divorced. You know, the people don't invite single guy. The families you know, they just like to.. so he was kind of outcasted also. So he knew one or two people so we went to their house. But it's not, you know, people, they they just don't say okay, yeah, you know, well, we'll do davit.. come over, we'll do this, we’ll do that… and everybody in our age is very reserved, you know… we just got used to have our environment and now I had to make friends. So what I did was I posted on social media. There's a there is a Facebook page one Pakistani woman in Montreal, right. So now before that, my sister in law is connected with South Asian woman Community Center in downtown SOC. So she is connected with them. So they had events and she invited me there so we went there. And then my husband would be going with me also, you know, because he didn't have any friends. And now I'm his friend. And then I'm not used to of having my husband because for very long time, I was just going by myself. So poor thing he would just come with me. So, me a couple of people there and I kind of used to go there for to meet people. There I met Maya. And she told me about Pakistani women in Montreal. So then I did that. And there I posted that, you know, I'm new in Montreal. I just came here and…Do we have any meetup groups for Pakistani women or you know… I didn't have any response, but I got one response. Theres a lady, she said, I'm here new also. And, you know, we can meet or you can come to my house and she has a day care in her house. So, I just went there and she lives right close to my house. So, I kind of met her. And then we used to meet for lunch. Yeah, and she's very nice lady. Then she invited me for Eid party with a couple of other people which I'm gonna…. see in this age you don't get friendly friendly with everybody. The kind of you know, you pick and choose. So she invited me two other places, you know, other friends, but I never got that close to any of them. And then I got one person I like…so I kind of talk to her and I invited her, and then my husband knew  a lady, and she told us that she does TCF work (the citizens foundation). So she had event for that. We went to that event. And then still, I didn't know anyone, you know, most of the people. So then, there and then some new little bit here and there. And then my brother came and I like to sing, you know, I always wanted to say my, my brother can sing my father can sing, but I was a closet singer and I am a closet singer, but I have dreamed that I will be a singer one day. But um, so my brother said, Why don't you know, now you have time, why don’t you take classes for that. So then I called someone and she said, well, there is one lady and she sings really good. And she gives, you know, classes also. And apparently she lives close to my house… walking distance. So, I went to her house and start taking lessons from her and then she started inviting me. So now she is from India. So now we have… now I have a good group of people. Mostly, I don't know some for some reason I get along better with the older people. Okay, you know, I don't have young friends that many but older than me just like Auntie's in their 70s or 80s. And I would like to talk to them. So then, yeah, so then I have a very different group. I have Indian, Pakistan, Bangladeshis… everything mixed because my husband is…you know, we just don't go like okay, this is, you know. When I was taking French classes I've made couple of friends there. I made two very young girls 24 years old. I think now there probably are 30 and one is South Indian and the other one is the Punjabi Sikh. And they both are my friends, but they are like my kids age. So, I'm kind of like them, mother. So, both of them got pregnant. Both of them have babies in this month in October. One had a baby boy and the other one had a baby girl. So, I’m knitting, I’m crocheting… I just finished a blanket for the baby girl. So yeah, so that's how, that's how I made my friends.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd, and then this is again, this is a question about, maybe not so much about the map, but how was it navigating dynamics of the home like, you know, having a man in your life again, how was that?', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tI'm still dealing that. Actually, actually, it was very good. It's very good. He is very nice, very open minded, and I can talk to him about anything, you know. I mean, we can be sitting in the car, not saying anything, and we still enjoy each other's company.  Yeah, it's different because I was used to just going by myself. You know, to these parties and then or, you know, anywhere, but now I have to let him know where I am, you know, like, I'm going here and come back here, you know, things like that. Or, you know, if somebody is coming to my house then you know, he has to be okay with that, too. I just have to let him know that You know, these people are coming. Friendship - I mean, I have to think about him also that we both have to get along with people because he, you know, with sometimes people… I did have to face the situation where we go into somebody's house or a gathering and then there would be a conversation about too much religion, religious conversation, and he was just like, look, I don't want to go there. So then I had to think about him. Should I invite these people over, you know, to make my group and so, you know, he's so yeah, so it's it's a different we have to. It's different in a way also because now I have to think about him, you know, making plans with my kids also, you know, going to the US, you know, how many days you're going, when are you going to come back? So, I think we both kind of appreciate each other because I never I never had a husband… you know, my sisters would be like, you know, fighting with their husband and then talking to them the next day, you know, lets go there, we went to shopping together. I never had that. I never had that. He was 18 years older than me. So, and but I didn't mind that as long as as long as there was a respectable relationship but there was no respectable relationship. There was more of I tell you to do this and you do this, So, so I never had that I always used to distant from him, you know. I was very scared of him like he can say anything or do anything. But with him, I can say anything, its more equal, you know, he's very supportive of me and we'll just hold hands in public, you know, and so, it's, it's, yeah, but uh, you know, it's funny because my friends would be telling me Oh, aap ka to honeymoon khatam nahi ho raha [your honeymoon isn’t ending]. And I’m like “haan buhdape ki shadi hai” you know, “ab kya karen” [we got married at an older age, what to do]. It was hard, because you know, divorce is a never thought in my, you know, mind that I will ever get divorced. I thought we will get old, and then kids will grow older and then he will mellow down, you know, but as much as he was getting older, he was getting crazier. The kids were going their ways. You know, and I was like, Okay, my son is not home on weekends, he's going to his friends house and then my daughter get to this age, she'll go out also. I had to take that step. You know, I had to, I had it was not easy. You know, I had to take that step. And, you know, and I never I never thought that I may meet someone because you know, in this age dating is not easy.

I'm enjoying things but at that time when I moved, I think the biggest challenge was to make my community you know, to make my friends to have a good circle, which I have right now. I think at that point, that was the biggest challenge because I you know, so…okay, if the spelling is not right…Uh, yeah, yeah, biggest challenge was first one was…making friends. Making like-minded friends. Yeah, not just any friends. like minded friends. And the second one is career, business, Yeah, and the other challenge is… the main challenges to keep….I just realized one thing it's funny how while I'm talking I'm pretty much realizing about myself. Okay, you know, the other challenge is…because before in Houston it was just me and the kids. two people I have to think about. I didn't, you know, don't have to think about me but yeah, to think of kids. Now I got mine two, his three, and then him, and then his, mother.

And I want to do things this way to make sure everybody is is equally treated. But I think he treats some someone different than the other in his kids and then I think there's issues with that part. But since I'm in the house I have to… at one point I was involved in it… I was like okay do this do this do this. But now I'm like no I can't do this because I get frustrated because I cant you know, I face that I'm an outsider. They're not my kids because I can you know…with my kids I can just tell them whatever I wanna tell them. Like when Naz and Jami were having issues I'm like no, Naz is like, Mom Jami is doing this to me. I'm like, Okay, tell me what Jami has done. You know when you move there, he has done this. No, I'm not taking sides… If Jami isn’t doing this, he has done many other things that are right, you have to see that also, you know. So I think that's my biggest challenge now. I'm there, but at the same time I have to put that glass wall that, you know, I shouldn't be involved in it.

Very quickly, it was very hard for them because my mother-in-law, she cant see. She has a eyesight problem and my FIL couldn’t hear So they had to move with us. I think within a year, they moved with us. So that was a big challenge because I used to be living on my own. The whole house – it was just my house. Now I have to like, they cant, I have to give them food in a plate, they cant see, you know, or they would be, or my MIL would want me to sit down with her, or watch dramas with her. And I think at one point I did that because I was excited also that I have someone at home. I never had MIL or FIL living at home. Then it gets too much, you know. And then, that part, I still would be very respectful but at the same time I would just close the room, you know and I think that was the challenging part, and then my FIL passed away and now my MIL is by herself and shes more needy because she cant see so she gets frustrated and she… yeah that’s a responsibility.  My husband is close. Since he works from home, he would take care of them, he would give them food. He is close to his parents but at the same time he gives me room also. You don’t have to do it, I’ll do it. So, Im glad he is like that. He’s not like, well you have to take care of everything. He’ll take more… but I’ll do it because you know, what goes around, comes around. I don’t want things like that. But it was challenging because we both cant fight because if we fight then they get upset. They think that there’s something they did that we are fighting about.

I worked at the vegan cafe, a grocery store, an Indian restaurant. It was a good experience. I learned a lot. And that was, like, somehow, I came across a person when I was working at the Indian restaurant, to who led me my full-time job. He recommended me. Ottawa was easier compared to Toronto. Like here, I don't know why, but I've only been able to meet people through the Meetup app other than my colleagues. So meeting people is hard, or making friends is hard, at least in my opinion in Toronto. It’s a busy city. Yeah. There was Indian food festival. I think I went to that and met some people in Toronto. Meetup has been more helpful so yesterday I went for a hike through the app. Like that was my first time and they have hikes every alternate week so that was quite nice.

Quit everything and settle here in Canada? And then does the other guy, hes like “if you have a good life? What do you want to move?” And this went on and on and on for a while. Its like really, a lot of negative aspects that he said. You should listen to other people's advice, but its totally upto you. As far as I can think maybe he wanted that kind of life and he didn't have it and [laughs]. I can say, Im lucky. I’ll add that. Me and my one of my close friends applied for the US visa together. Same time, same embassy. All I got asked in the visa interview was which university? And What's your major? That’s it Two questions? You didn't ask me for any paperwork?, nothing.

At the same time for a woman in my country… My country is democratic but at the same time the women in same positions get much less than men…that’s disgusting… I really didn’t like that we worked two times more than men and you get to two times less money. That's because there is a huge gap. Its not the the topic of the main… usually it's not discussed sometimes know some, some companies they are good, but in my case that they were not.

So, when I arrived here, so I didn't want to go to other fields because that’s the only thing that I can do. Not that that’s the only thing but that’s the thing I would like to do. Ideally it would be urban planning but that’s a bit hard to get. You need extra licences and certifications for planners. there’s like a never-ending circle of requirements. Firstly, you need education. For education you need ... like you need to start from scratch for urban planning. For architecture it’s a bit easier. I need a confirmation of my diploma but still that takes time. So I inquire with the public support companies, support for new comers who specialise in architecture so I did some coirses for architects – certain bridging programs and then I was enrolled in a 2 month placement – unpaid unfortunately but still I got a clue about how it works because its quite different from my country and from Europe. The structure is just absolutely different. When you never did this before. Here you come and everything is wood wood wood. In Europe there is good construction but not so much as here. Like here everything is much more costly, and the materials are all wood, and they measure in inches and im used to measure in meters. Its onlt now I get used to that. After the bridging program I was directed to the co-op. That was voluntary. Not like you have to go there but instead of just sitting there wasting your time, I took that opportunity. So that was in Feb to Apr. So since April I sometimes do different projects for this guy. Not regularly but the first project I did was 3.5 weeks and now its much more faster. I enjoy when projects changes regularly. He was connected to the… He had his own company about the co-op students and not only you come to work, but he teaches and supports the students from the co-op with short term projects. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd is this paid work now?

So the government covers the part of the salary for employer. So, its 40% or 50% something like that. Its covered for the first time employer. So he didn't have any appointments before. So the government - they support the hiring of newcomers. So he was trying to hire me but the thing was the the employer needs to have his company for a year and at that time his company was 8 months. So the reason I was told is that they didn't want to emerging businesses to use this opportunity just to run their business, from scratch, they want the company that can survive so that this could be beneficial for both. So now I was waiting for this year so I am still waiting until Christmas because you never know what will happen until I have the job offer or confirmation. Because that happened to me before, when we were waiting for the response for one and a half month. I agree with the person that I will start and I did not say sorry can I go to another interview. That’s not nice. So, at the end because of this 8 months I just lost 7 weeks of sending my resumes or applying for other roles. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo when you were applying to come to Canada will you also can consider on other destinations?', '', '', '', 'D:\\tI was considering... So the thing was I applied in… I started collecting documents…I cant remember when it was but late 2017. So on 2018 – yes in the beginning of 2018. Just last year. So before that I was applying for the Green card but that was like a, I was just trying for it.. like not expecting that something would happen. That was just for fun. So, and when I was applying for the Green card I thought I would also just apply for Canada. Why not also do this application. I was considering US more than Europe – like American countries or north America more than Europe. So mu country is in the middle of Europe and Asia. Australia is a bit, maybe geographically, it’s the same difference but its so far. It feels far away. When I was in my country, I was talking to some Australians and they were spending like 2 days to get to Paris or somewhere around, like 5 changes. And Canada was like 1 day in transit. Canada is more like, I understand Canada better. Australia seems very different, like a different region, also the weather is upside down. Canada is more to what I am used to. Political situation in Europe was not very nice. I don’t think its sustainable if I can say so, stable? For immigration, like where I would go would be France – where I was studying or maybe UK. For me in France the problem was language because I didn’t have enough time to study it. French people, they’re really closed. To get in that community, you need to work really hard. For UK it was hardly possible to find any immigration options and the same like, story with Brexit and all this. Its so nervous around Europe and Canada is far away from all this. Its mostly calm. Yeah, US you have some craziness on the side. Its not like in Europe you have 10 neighbouring countries and theres a lot of political pressure. At least here you feel like, its more stable. I mean there is some political issues around through US but you don’t feel the pressure.

So, problem was the lawyer – he was certified lawyer and so actually…so, he helped around 10 families let’s say…. He sent them and then people spread the word and then second time other people came… and he just collected the money, grab the money and left and my mom was in the second part [laughs]. I was considering going to Germany before for my second year but then my university didn’t provide me some documents. So, there was some problems. I didn’t have much option. So didn’t apply to any other places and I decided to study Masters. That’s it and I moved to France and at that time, like 2007-8 there was an economic crisis which affected the construction industry a couple of years later. So, it was impossible to find a job. It was very hard. Some people were staying for PhD but, at that moment I was just tired. I thought maybe in few years. At that time I was like, no not now [laughs]. After that I came back and it was fine. I was working on a large-scale project, Asian games. So, I went to Indonesia. The environment was so nice. I wanted to stay longer. Everything was so rapid around, it was interesting. It was a great experience. It was a multicultural environment which was new to me. But, that’s about the country, the mentality – how it works [in Azerbaijan]. That was why I left – not the crucial reason but one of the reasons. It’s a little like Turkey, maybe?', '', '', '', 'D:\\tTourism is now big in the country. It doesn’t really help the locals. Its less affordable than to go to other countries. For majority of people that live, I think that’s not good. It’s just not affordable. You get paid for example $700 a month and you spend, just to go somewhere for 2 days, like $400 or $300 and for 2 days! Its sometimes that bad. It was not like this before. Before the tourism was not so developed. So what worked for tourists is that the visas got cancelled [visa on arrival]. So they want tourists to come and spend their money in dollars, and they adjust it so it puts prices up for local people. So, for international tourists it’s still fine but for locals its more than the previous prices.

At the time we didn’t spend it all yet and I was lucky to get, like contact some lawyers that some people from my country recommended. It was still a risk but it’s always a risk. But there was no possibility of doing this without a lawyer. And then I just started collecting documents. They requested like, this paper, medicals, diploma, something something. I was just sending that and then after we applied, in August – we applied in March. In 6 months we got the response that we need to pay the arrival fee – the last step. I was collecting documents for 7 months – 7 months from when I contacted the lawyer and started.

They had at that time the architecture university – it was free for international students you just had to pay, like student and teaching fee which was like 150 euros. But on the year I was applying, it was shifted up to 25000 euros. From zero to 25000. So I was looking for others and France was fine. After I left, they moved it up but not like 25000.

Most of the dealing was done online and then after the big chat that I want to apply, there was conference or seminar in my city so they said that if you want to meet her and see her, you can. So we just went and met and I would say that it wasn’t that personal meeting. You can ask questions in 5 minutes and understand how they work, and also trust. So went to the seminar before using.

But she was still afraid to recommend me. Until the last day she was worried that if something goes wrong she will be responsible. So, she had a bit of stress too. But it was fine. It was more, I suppose safe, that she was a part of my network, like you know the people, at least through someone. That was pretty fine. That story – like it happened to my mom in late 90s.

To get through that you need time, you need hours of research. But still you get what I mean. That’s why I prefer to use a lawyer. Even the date, the date you apply plays a role. The same application a couple of weeks later could be different. So now, I know they should be certified and you can check them online. At that time, I don’t know, maybe I was lazy..

The challenge – the biggest challenge and still for now is like, employment and in my case, first thing that is challenging is that there is no Canadian experience which they stick to no matter where you work. It can be McDonalds, or any other place, cleaner, doesn’t matter. If you don’t have Canadian work experience, it reduces your chances of employment. So, lack of Canadian experience and they want it usually longer than a year. I have here like 5-6 months. They usually write like 3 years on Canadian experience, 5 years of Canadian experience in the job ads. I find it a challenge because that’s n ot fair. The thing is that if I was told that they don’t care the skills in Canada you have so even the cleaner, or some service jobs – they still would consider it a Canadian experience. Even if you apply for design but you haven’t worked in design, they still would consider you. But I think that’s the perception coz I was working in an international environment and I know the system – how it works. So maybe for some people its important. You also have interviews for that to understand that people can work or not. But on the point of applications, you should not just throw the paper without looking at it. Certifications, licensing, there is also another local expect for WES, another diploma confirmation. So, WES works only for arrival. Here, you need to go to another, in my case. WES only works for immigration purposes. Generally, its good. I had it added in my resume but actually, the diploma is confirmed by WES. This certification, this should be a CACB authority – that’s architecture board. Im not sure if planning has it as all. But they are some courses that are not approved at all. But I hope to do that in some time because it is still costly. The challenge I would say, is finding an apartment because you don’t have a credit history and that reduces your chances. We behaved well and very nice, really because I have education and I can say that im not going to not pay you money. I don’t want that problems. I think that’s – maybe that’s a perception but that still works in some cases. I found the driving licence a major obstacle for me. Yeah, coz I didn’t have a car before. I had a license back in my country before. Here the system is.. first of all you get the G1 which is training. Then after a year you still can drive only with a person who has the G4. I can only drive on my license only for 30 days or 60 days. And I failed it too. And the thing is I need a confirmation from my country to get the licence directly but that’s an issue now that I am here. And still this is an obstacle for jobs as well because even if I have a good commute to the location of the interview, most of the cases they ask about the driving license. That’s an issue because in most of the job descriptions, it is written that they require a G4 driving license. So for me, its like a huge… its not a challenge, its an annoying. I decided to wait for the confirmation from my country because I don’t want to go through the test again, because what if I don’t pass it again. When I have this letter, they allow me to get the license directly. I just applied it today. That was local fee plus payment to home country embassy for driving experience confirmation. [husband] did that already. So he did that I didn’t and we decided to do that because at least one of us would have it.

Im never active on advising unless they ask for that and that's their decision absolutely so if I can advice…im not going to push. In one case I just said like you know just do it if you want to do this..go to Canada if need to do some changes you should start instead of just sitting complaining. \", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tDid you receive any bad migration advice from anybody?', '', '', '', \"D:\\tI heard a lot of complaints from the people for here. Always the people who stay here say that go back. There's some sort of people are never satisfied. They're always complaining. So I just try to avoid this people. That was on the forums maybe just maybe once or twice on YouTube, by community. They complain in some cases. Like what happened was my husband was addicted to youtube before arrival to Canada. Like last two weeks. He was just sitting so stressed. I just asked…What are you? Why are you so stressed? It looks like so bad he told me. I said Why? And he said I watched it on YouTube. I was like can you imagine any normal person was satisfied with his life, coming to YouTube and saying how good it is? No. Usually people come to complain. You only hear mostly the negative. Especially for post-soviet people..the mentality of our people. It's not only them…. I am like this too, but not so much. I hope so. Always complain to find the bad things, to discuss it…this could be better or I had it better before. Usually you watch it in your own language and this people, when you Google it, it comes out as research. You see the negative just stop watching that please please…And he said like yeah, maybe you're right. And really the fact that maybe we didn't meet the circumstances this people met when they came.

I would be happy if I have 2 kids. Probably get the mortgage before they come so they have a house. In the more future. I don't know how is it possible, Maybe a design company? That one is very far but I would like to invest in green technology, not developed but, there are many young researchers to do their job very well and they just need to push to get into the market. You know that franchise thing? You get their idea and stuff and they still get to participate… something like that…maybe in, how can I say it? green technologies – but that’s way too far.

Oh, so that’s something here - for Junior position they consider me as overqualified. In intermediate positions, I don't get to that stage. So, in many cases, they…when I applied for the project technician lets say, they say you need to go more to design. When I go to design, they say I don’t pass the search engines.

Do you like living here?', '', '', '', 'D:\\tUmm yes, One thing about the choice of the city is that… most cities in the', '', \"world will have the sea. The beaches, and you get a lot of fresh air. So one of the other reasons I choose Toronto is because it has a huge lake. I don’t live by the lake but I do have the opportunity to go and see when I want. Its pretty costly to do things at the moment because of the financial situation. But we are in the process of getting a car. Its still the cost of insurance, its like crazy. The average is around 200 a month which is a lot. For me at the moment, I don’t need a car. Its also crazy parking prices. I would rather drop it at a subway that has a parking and take the train. But for my husband, hes commuting to the north part and there are only buses and the distance is not that much but he wastes like one hour for only 5 kms. So he definitely needs a car.M:\\tLet's begin with when you first arrived to Canada\", '', '', '', 'Ol:\\tI arrived on April 29 2013?', '', '', 'M:\\tThat is very specific. Wow.

Like, what were the main factors you considered in making that decision?', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tI think if I had to pick one, I would say the political climate in Mexico. It was the party that used to govern Mexico, and basically turn Mexico into pieces, was going back into power. And everything was getting really dangerous, crime was spiking again. And I was just tired. And also those lack of opportunities, so what happens in Mexico is because of the economy model that is used… the gap between middle class and high class is getting really really big right to the point that right now there's not really a middle class in Mexico. It's either you have a shit ton of money or you're working class and if you lose your job, you're basically homeless. So I was approaching the bottom and and that was just tired. I was just tired of being working 10 to 12 hours a day plus something extra to come later just to make extra money. And then I think the cherry cherry on the cake was the this the Peña Nieto who was a president, he won. It was a fraud but he won and he was going to be the party is going to come back and steal everything… just destroy the country again, which it happens. But I wasn't there anymore. But that was the main reason why we decided to move. Me and my wife. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd which part of Mexico were you in?', '', '', '', 'Ol:\\tMexico City ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay. And that was the only motivation, sort of the main one, like what other factors that you consider?', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tThat was the main one. I would say there are other factors that, that I know when I think back at the time, I know like one was, I think I wanted to reinvent myself. That's one thing that I couldn't be. I couldn't do it in Mexico. Another thing I would say I wanted to experience a different culture. I worked for a few months in Spain. Yeah. And I really liked it. But I also wanted to go to North America, and I don't like United States or Canada was my first option.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, and why Canada? I mean, we I've you just said that Canada was your first option, like had you done a lot of prior research into Canada? \", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tI did research Bunch of countries based mostly Europe, Canada, US… even and I consider the US. So it's a North America, Europe and Australia at some point, Australia too. Yeah, I checked that. And after so I'm so just to give you something Yeah, I'm a project manager. I'm an engineer, I have a software engineering degree. So, I'm very methodical person. So basically, created a huge spreadsheet with pros and cons for every country.. So, it was kinda interesting that I mean, the first thing that we consider was we need speak the language. That's one of the things that we wanted…that narrows or I mean, not a lot, but now is basically to the US, Canada, in America, the UK, I mean, Scotland and Ireland and Spain as well and Australia. was basically that in the end that those ended up being a..lets say second choice. And then after that I did all this analysis and all the immigration processes of the openness of the culture regarding immigration. And after reading all that, I realized that Okay, so it's Australia or Canada. Those are the more open cultures loving immigration. So either or so, and the main decision was well Australia’s kinda far. And so if, and it had happened, so if one of our family members of friends die, we want to be there. If we took a flight from Australia to Mexico City..it's like 27 hours. If you took a flight from Toronto to Mexico it is four hours.

And the second one is somewhere where there was a plan to expand Ontario's technology budget to make it easier for IT companies to come in, starting in 2015, or something was 2016. So, I read that. And I remember it caught my eyes like, well, it's better to be there to have to know some people were ready when when this comes. It's going to be huge. And it's coming right now. You can see now, some bunch of technology companies opening up many branches here. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd in terms of your options that were available to you, so did you know that you had to go on a student visa or were there other migration options available to you You can, what kind of options Did you consider', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tSo student visa was the last option. The first option was PR. At the time, there was no express entry. So we applied and we got invited for an interview to go to the PR. But the interview was scheduled for 27 months after we got the invitation. So, a little over two years old, we go the invite in 2012 and the interview was scheduled to be in 2014.. Yeah, it was. It was not it was not entirely the express entry. So this express entry is amazing. Back then was like you submitted all the papers. Waited we waited for almost a year to receive an answer. You get an answer and then saying, Hey, we know we like you. But again, we have received your your papers. Now you can come for an interview in 27 months. Express entry started… I think was like 2016,,, should be 2016 or maybe 20, late 2015 that it started. So all of this sort of programs like the Canadian experience class… they existed, okay, but it didn't have Express entry.. So extress entry is just the way you select applicants. But back then before Express entry, you submit something… you wait for a year, a couple years. And then at some point, you get a letter that says “Oh, thank you”. Actually for the podcast. I interviewed one lady and she said that she applied six years. Six years later, she got the invite. So like people are just kind of hoping for the best.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo you, you didn't want to wait for 27 months.\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tWe didn't want to wait. And it would have been kind of we received the invitation kind of at the same time that this president won the election. So, it was like, No, we need to go somewhere else. So, I started looking for a job in my field. But it's really hard to get a job if you're not in the country. So, I never got and I got a couple of interviews, phone interviews, and when I tell them that, and say but I just need a job offer and then I'll get the permit. And they were like yeah, no. It was a little challenging. So, we tried that for a few months. And then we were working with an agency that was helping us with the immigration process. And they said, okay, you have another option. You can go as a student. One of you goes and studies a postgrad program and the other one gets automatically.. they get a work permit. So, so we decided that I was going to be the one studying. My wife didn't want to study. So I took the fall because I didn't want to sit and say I don't like school. So, it's like, Okay, I'm good. And, and we get and I think that process took us like two months. Like from the moment we apply to the college, they said, Yes, like two days.

Not university for Human Resources. It was the cheapest program that had a co-op program in the end.

When you're back in Mexico, you think that everything's gonna be the same. When you come here is there's ., there’s some subtleties that you don't know until you leave. Yeah. So studying them was really good, like a cover letter. In Mexico we don’t use a cover letter. Tailoring the resume for what you’re applying for, We didn't do that in Mexico. We only use one resume, and just send it everywhere. So those little things I learned by studying that. So I think I'm so happy that I picked that thing. But that was not the reason. The main reason was to was the cheapest way to get there and the easiest way to get a job.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd in terms of skilled migration, like how do you mean, considering that you are already working in this skilled profession, which is, I mean, software engineering, which is, I think, considered skilled, skilled anywhere in the world. How did that that's sort of like what was the perception at the time When you were going into this course of human resources, like how did you consider that? Or how do you consider now also yourself to be skilled? I mean, the question with this with this, the study is about how do people, how do people self identify as skilled? So how do your what's your identification of skills or skills? Or being skilled?\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tHow do I identify myself? I knew it was skilled. I knew I was sure what I was doing. I had been doing project management for software projects, for years. There was a lot of things that I didn't know, at the time.

Like, I knew that I had the skills to get a good job and all that. Is that kind of question. Yeah, and I think studying here, the HR course was pretty healthy. Just to, because you know what, it's funny because I don't think it happens a lot in Latin America. And I don't know if other countries but at least in Mexico, it happens a lot that you see people from the US or Canada and you automatically assume that everybody knows more than you. Just because they come from the first world country they do they have access to better and we don't, all those kind of things when you automatically assume that they might be better than you. When I went to school, the good thing is that most most of my classmates were from from here. And I realized that no, everybody's the same. Everybody's human. Everybody has their flaws. And they don't have any. And I noticed that because to be fair, I think it was a it was part of the privileged generation. I was able to go to private schools in Mexico and really good private schools. So, all the knowledge that I have was way bigger than the knowledge that my Canadian classmates had and it's funny because there's things that I knew from Canada that they didn’t know. And we would just start talking about Mexico or another country. They were like, yeah, I have no idea, Mexico is the beach and maybe some kind of ruins but that's it. So I started realizing that my knowledge and my skills were even superior than a lot of people, but not because, not in a cocky way that yeah, I’m better than them. It's just that I think was privileged enough to have a good education. And, and another thing that I always I love, I love learning, always doing things. So, I think that part of myself helped me to understand that prejudice that I've had before was completely wrong. Not because I'm from Mexico, I know less than them. We are all humans; we are here to learn. You're not less than the other ones. It's not that I started thinking on you guys are less. Also, like, you know, speaking English, for me was like, I learned English when I was a kid. And I was like, Oh, yeah, I need to pronounce everything perfectly, or they're gonna make fun of me or no ones gonna take me serious, or I need to write everything perfectly.

So for me, even the Centre for me it's a little too right wing. So, but it's kind of like hypocritical because I work in a FinTech company for bank so it’s a little hypocritical. But I am. I'm very inclined to the left. Like very, very inclined to left, I wouldn’t say radical because if you think about the left, even in Latin America usually the left is associated with either guerrilla, in like Colombia, or dictatorships like Fidel Castro or Maduro right now in Venezuela. So, I don't identify with them. I'm more like a let's distribute economically I think Im more leftisit than…I think the world should be distributed equally. I'm in favor of universal global income, I'm in favor of paying a huge amount of taxes if that's going to help, I don't have kids, but if my taxes pay for my neighbour’s education I'm completely okay with that. And I'm not sick. I always been here for six years and I always and I only had to use the walk-in clinic once, never gone to the hospital but if my taxes go to the health of the people, I'm completely fine with that. So those kinds of things that would be my inclination. In Mexico the problem is that Mexico is a very conservative kind of right wing oriented country.

You have no 50% people here immigrants and and I even in my job I think Canadians are the minority. We have like six Canadians and 50 immigrants so it's a for me it's a bubble and I like the bubble. That's why I live here. But if you go outside if you go to small towns, it's completely white towns and they're really nice people and then might not discriminate you but they are the ones who got Doug Ford into power. They are the ones who are going to be voting conservative this time. So, it's a it's a polite, it's an open society, but still a conservative society. If you think about it, getting divorced here, you need to, I think be separated for a year or may prove that there's some kind of physical violence. And when you think about the most progressive country even in Mexico, you can get divorce because its like I don't want to be married with this guy anymore. It’s like okay fine sign this and you’re divorced. That's it. So, this kind of things actually made me think.. like even with Europe. Like one of the more progressive countries like Spain, it's kind, its way behind. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tIf applicable, which it is in your case.

We do have a bridge Oh, you have actually applied for that as well. Alright. So that's, that's kind of the show. \", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tLet's start from where from here. I have nothing. So, let's say I was here it was in Mexico. And then right now I have a PR in Canada. Okay. So what I did, I started here. So at the beginning based I told you we were doing with an agency in Mexico. So, they suggested to apply for the PR as a skilled worker. So that I would say that happened here. She was like a PR application, and was skilled worker was. Oh, that's another thing and right now you have the express entry and depending on your points, you apply for something. Back then you needed to apply to something in particular. Either you applied for a Canadian experience PR or skilled worker PR. So, you had to pick one. So, we applied for skilled worker. We, when we didn't apply, we were submitting all the papers and or the agency something changed then. This was the, this was December 2009. Okay. Something happened. I don't remember what, but something changed for the next year. So starting in January, there's something changing. We didn't have all the requirements and papers and all that. So we basically discarded this. And then we went just like Okay, now let's apply for PR, but it was for Provincial Nominee. That one was for Quebec. This is the time when we started learning French right, and this happened. I think we did. It was early like January or February when I say February 2010. We applied for this, started learning French and all that, but they told us was like, it's gonna take a while. And when when you get it, you're gonna be, you're gonna have to submit your French tests and all that. So, you have like a year for you to learn French. Because I told you, it used to take a long time to get an invitation and then we just waited. And I don't know, let me check, we were right here in 2013. So, it was 2012 it was the summer of 2012. Yeah. So on the summer of 2012 was let's say, July. So yeah, it took two years. We received the invitation for the interview. And, and this was related to this one [Quebec provincial nomination], but the promise that the interview was going to happen in 2014. So we said like, No, we don't want to do that. And so we asked for options. And he said NAFTA. NAFTA is an option. So we started looking into NAFTA, when there was some North American Free Trade Agreement. So, the problem with this I mentioned is that getting a job from outside the country will be hard. So, this didn't work. Then, it was, was that was our issue I want. No, I'm mixing dates. This happened in 2011. Yes, 20 11 and this was going to happen in 2013 because it was not July was like almost like the end of the year, like October so October 2011 is when we received the letter, then we thought about the NAFTA. And I started looking for a job back then. And I think it took me like six to eight months or something to realize that I was not going to get a job and I was applying it was. But it was the problem with this I was applying the same way would apply in Mexico. just reading it and sending it so didn't work. So then in Well, this actually happened in 2011 and 2012 is when this guy the president won. So this one we said like you know what, we can't we can't stay here. So we applied for the student visa. Well, we started considering, we didn't apply yet. We started considering. So we started considering this, but then I got a I got a I got assigned to a project in Spain. So, I moved to Spain. The original idea was to move in September here. So we're thinking about planning for September. But then this is a great opportunity. It was $9 million project. So, it wasn't really great on the rest of the international experience. It was moving to Spain, I was going to work for the UK. So basically travel between Spain UK for a few months. So I thought it was going to be quite cool, its gonna look great on my resume. So, I cannot. I mean, we can. It's gonna be a six month project. So we can feel we can do this later. We can we can apply for for coming in January or that so we kinda waited. And then we started applying for student visa in October but then I was in Spain so we didn't have all the documents. So, we gave up and decided to apply for April. So, this is what happened. So in April. So, so we started thinking about this we ended up flying formally in well, we actually applied in October 2012. But then we delayed it onto the the summer semester. So I was in Spain from September to December. And then I went back to Mexico and it was kind of crazy because we didn't finish the project. I was working in Mexico but we Spain's timezone. I was waking up at one in the morning started working at two in the morning oh wow and by noon it was done but it was super tired yeah but at the to the story so um so we applied back we applied then we asked the college to not to apply for the winter semester we applied for summer semester and on April 29 2013 we arrived together and this was I had a student permit and my wife had a work permit. So a year past and after a year I got the so it was kind of the same, let's say April 2014. I got my work permit. At the time I got a job. Not this one I got another job that was like a super crappy job with super entry level, really bad job. That was on HR because we have we had in the program, in the HR program, we had a co-op semester, and I got a co-op position in that place. And after the four months as you're like, Hey, we want to keep you they offered me like your shitty salary. And the job was really bad. But I felt at the time I didn't have any options so I was like Yeah, I need to get a job. And also not because I didn't have any options as a person, but because I needed to start building my Canadian experience, because you needed I think, two years to apply for that because back then it was still this program that I was telling you. So when I needed to work for two years in Canada to apply as a permanent residence. So that's why I accepted. But then that worked till 2014 and then 2014 then in 2015 again around the same time in 2015 my work permit expired which was only one year, they only give you the same amount if you work for less than leave us to study for less than two years. They give you a work permit for the exact amount of time they work. But if you study more than that, they give you three years. But I only studied one year so I only had one. Yeah, here is when I applied for the NATFA. And because we already had a job in this company and for the NAFTA, you have to be you have to be working in certain professions. Not all professions can for the NAFTA. But technology is one. So if I hadn't stayed in the other job, I wouldn't be able to apply for the NAFTA. So then I got my NAFTA work permit for another year. Was in one year of two years? Okay, so we got 2018 we got the university in 2017. So, this was two years, so I got it in. Yeah 2015. I had to renew it at some point because it was you had to renew it every year. But I got this one on to like for two years. So you have to renew it. And then starting on early 2017, let's say February. I started applying for the PR. The first time that I applied by myself, I got denied and I got the denial around my birthday so it was May. It's kind of ridiculous when I was submitted all the papers I forgot to upload the translation of our marriage certificate and instead of the saying hey you're missing the translation, Can you send it back? They actually denied and declined the whole application. Yeah, and that's that's when I say that society might be open but you have some people that are still not because one of my friends forgot to upload their passport, which is even worse than the marriage certificate and they came back like hey, we're missing this documents. Could you please upload them? He did and it went smoothly. In my case they just did this. I was really upset. I called them and nobody cared. Yeah, and actually they told me that it's totally depends on the person who's reviewing your profile.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tCan you not appeal it?', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tI could. Okay, but I do have time because the thing is with the work permit, that you cannot be more than three years with a work permit… temporary work permit. You either go back to a country or you become a permanent residency, right? And if you count this work permit was two years of NAFTA, I didn't have any choice. And the good thing is that the company where I'm still at the they really liked me and they valued me so they hired a lawyer and the lawyer reapplied for the PR and we did this process right after I got to do now which was around my birthday, so say May 2017. We apply for the PR. This time, the lawyers did everything. And nothing was missed. But it's so expensive that if it wasn't the company, I wouldn't be able to pay. I think the bill ended up being like $12,000. And they paid for it, I wouldn't be able to pay for that. So I'm really I'm really thankful. I'm really grateful for them. They couldn't sponsor me because there was some restrictions. And the lawyer basically analyzed everything. And they said, this is the best approach. They did it. And it actually worked because on September 2017 we got our PR. So, you see, it's like, what, like five months or four months. And so, we got all the papers and everything. So, the only thing we needed to do was to go out of the country and return as a landed immigrant, which we did in October. We actually, we celebrate, we took a two week trip to the UK.  We toured a lot of places over there. And when we came back, we landed as immigrants in October 2017.  I think you can, if you don't want to go out of the country, you can schedule an interview with some government agency. And then you can just go there and they do all the paperwork for you, but it's faster if you go out and come back. Most of my friends that I have a flight like that. Most of them have… they drive to Buffalo, and they come back. I mean, you still need to use lead someone to actually see that you're actually the person who’s arriving? And I think the airports and the borders of they already have an infrastructure. So why spend more money having an office? If someone can just like in the end, I think the way they see it is, you're the one who's going to be wanting the permanent residency. So if you cannot go out of the country come back then...its your problem. I think it's efficient. And I think it's saving overheads. And this happens like all the work permits, they just arrive by mail. But the PR, it's different, like some kind of a ceremonial system. For us it was great because we arrived late at night. I think we are flight landed at maybe two in the morning. So, the immigration office at Pearson was empty. So, it took us like five minutes to get the PR card so well they print the cards. So you can well I guess they take a picture of their So did they take the picture there? No, they use the picture that you submitted. So actually, they could print them and mail them to you. But anyway, thats the process. You need to go out and come back. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, now, I'm going to move on to Yeah, so that's that that's with regards to the sort of timeline and visa categories right. And that's everything will go to the commercial services and things about commercial services you used in your migration journeys, the things that you paid for. So agents, lawyers, which I know that your company paid for in this case. But other things as well. So, education that you paid for career consultants that you may have paid for document translation, skills assessment anything throughout this whole journey that you paid\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tFirst we paid in Mexico for another lawyer which was the one who was helping us to do this because when we started we know nothing knew nothing so so we paid for a lawyer here we had to pay for translations of all the documents in the beginning. We had to pay for a lot of translations because every time you apply, they need IELTS, you need to pay for someone to assess and I think I had to pay now that I'm going to be applying for the citizen I think I need to do the exam again. Anyway, I applied here, then. So, we applied here. We did the IELTS here for English language, then we around here. It was right before we got the invite thing we started we applied…We presented our  I don't remember names for French, French language, French and English. We pay for those. We got here we paid for the college program. It's like three times more than what a resident or citizen would pay - 17K. So it was the cheapest one. But my friends from from here they were paying like four or 5000 so I paid for that. Then I think every time that we applied, I had to have to pay for something it was like for the PR was worse because then you need to get your criminal record check. You need to get your criminal records from your home country as well. You need to get everything translated like everything marriage certificates. All that. What else?...because at the time you had to be for a visa as Mexican, you have to apply for a visa for to enter Canada, so you have to apply for that as well. Yeah, we have to do a health assessment for the PR only. That was only for PR. What else? There were three language tests because they expire in 2 years and I have to do a fourth one now for the citizenship. Because according to but according to the government, you forget the language in two years, I guess. I don't know.  But we did pay for the place to live. What else, what else,  \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo if you remember later on that stuff that you've paid for so so we can move on. Yeah. Okay. Um, so tell me about the role of technology in your migration journey from the initial arrival stage to now. So, what I'm trying to, I suppose here is how did you conduct online research if you were doing and what sort of resources did you use if you want to put them on your map? Social media avenues, or any sort of other online assistance in your migration journey?\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tMost of the research done if not all, was done online. I'm very… I mean I am a software engineer, so I'm very comfortable doing that. So, at the in the beginning, my main was like, Google search And I used to check a lot of blog posts, blogs that talk like people. I think I noticed that when people move here, they're so excited. And they want to share their experience. So, they start writing the blog. But then after three posts, they never write anything else. But at least you have the beginning. So, you have something. Social media. Facebook, I would say, Mostly because there's a lot of newcomers to Canada group. So, Mexicans in Toronto, those kinds of things that are completely useless but I checked them. There's there was a blog that was written by... It was from Latin America, maybe Colombian and it was in Spanish then they explained the shock that they got when they went to the grocery store like prices and they were looking for bananas is like there's no banana, because it is winter. And for me, it was like, Where am I going? Then you get here and you realize it doesn't matter if it's winter, you get bananas because globalization, but I just for me at the time, that was shocking because like, where am I going like, if I want to eat pineapples, you cannot eat that unless it's summer, which is a complete lie. So, but maybe they…. maybe they weren't living in Toronto, maybe they were living in one of those small towns that I was mentioning. But for me it was kind of shocking. So, it actually gave me some ideas on what to expect. That I think was a good thing because when I got here, the culture shock for me was almost minimal. It was almost nothing.  Because I already did a lot of research. I used to work with a lot of people from the US so for me, it was not a huge deal. and I like the cold. So, I was okay. For my wife it was a little bit different. But regarding social media, I think the main reason why I think they're useless and mostly when when some blog posts it's a little different because it's someone who actually wants to share their experience, when they take the time to write some social media its mostly someone who knows nothing. x asks a question, and everybody answers whatever they think it's the right answer. So, it's like one person saying, Hey, I'm going to.. okay, remember that one. Someone said Hey, I'm moving to Toronto and I don't want to buy a car. How much should I save for, for public transit? How expensive it is. And to be honest, if you just Google Toronto Public transit, you see the first but someone asked that. And then there are little things like you're going to spend like $300 a month and then someone else is like you can buy a pass it is going to be 100 bucks. And the thing is that because there's so many answers, and most of them are wrong, that just confuse you. So, I gave up with social media, I think at this stage, and most of the most of the research I did after was either blogs that I considered more serious, or immigration lawyers websites. I saw that that that was a lot lawyers, websites. There was a lot of information there. And podcasts, And one of the things I like about the podcast is that I think I only found one that was talking about Canada, Most of them were talking about the the US or Europe. And I found it was people talking about their their experiences, but it was kind of interesting to learn how the shocks that they were Facing. So that happened way before we got here. So we did all the research. And good, I would say most of the research was done. And also the CIC website. The Canadian immigration one - That one I think I checked in every day like anything that happened is checking. And news from the global mail. I subscribed to the global mail for a bit in Mexico, just to learn a little bit of a culture and stuff like that.\", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd I want you to think of social media, I mean, technology not in terms of researching but also the role of technology in your life as an immigrant broadly. What is what is some some technology that you use or continue to use or have used? Is there any sort of significant technological', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tMostly my phone. The smartphone is because any question you have, it's just. Google Maps is amazing because you when you get to see that you need to know where you're at. Okay, Google Maps helps you. But the thing about the phone right now is that it's a small computer, you can just make phone calls with it. But I would say the most important thing between my laptop and my phone, I think those saved my life when I got here. Even for because I came as a student, I needed to take notes, work, something is just my computer. But in the day to day, it was mostly my phone and like, have a Google Maps. Anything I wanted to check was just there. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tHere what you said immigration lawyers, websites and blogs. Do you remember particular examples of these? any websites that come to mind or you don't?\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tThe guys who actually did my process over here, that's Greenland's bgl. I check their website but I, at the time I found them like a little too poshy. It ended up I mean, they're super expensive. I remember these guys because it shocked me the the cost at the time. There was another one. But it was around when I was in Spain. So, it was around this time here. Around this time, I found it when I was in Spain, and I found it and I remember it was so good that I sent a link to my wife. It was great. It was a Lawyer, but he had a blog in there. And every, every week or every two weeks he posted something about Canada. Canadavisa.com. Okay, so I guess it Yeah, it's kind of famous. Yeah, I remember I saw it when I found in Spain because I had nothing to do with my wife state and Mexico. She was like, Yeah, I was doing research. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tTell me about the role of your social connections on your maps or friends, family, greater community, professional networks, anything significant that you'd like to put on your map in how they affected your migration from the initial stage to where you are now.\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tMy family in Mexico. It was about my mom and my sister and my dad a little bit. But mostly when I talk about my family, its my mom and sister. I don't think I ever hesitated coming here because of them but it affected me because we're really close. So just one example we used to go to do have a coffee every week, like my mom after work, and then my sister arrived and then I arrived and it was like a ritual every week. Those little things affected me. And it was over here like Around this time, she was like my family. And I have a group of friends that we've been friends since University and we used to play video games together and play dungeons and dragons together,  like nerdy stuff. But we used to do it every week, every Thursday. So that was one of the things one of those rituals that you know you're not gonna have even when I moved here when we when we moved over here. So when we moved here I started to keep the show my d&d group these guys we started playing Dungeons and Dragons online. So they met in one of them's house and they just put a computer with my face there. It was fun, and I think is one of the things that I needed to still feel that I was in. Yeah, one of the good things is that I'm, I'm a very social person, but I really, really enjoy time with myself. So the first month when we got from April 29 to early June, I didn't have a phone. So, my birthday is in May 26. So, nobody called me on my birthday because there was no phone to call me. And I really enjoyed that month of having no connection with the world. I really enjoyed it. I don't know if I would do it again. But I really enjoyed it. So, focusing on another thing I was starting school was But anyway, those kind of things. One of the things I think helped me a lot is when I started when I started school at George Brown. People here were really friendly. There was like half immigrants, half non-immigrants. And and, and we started hanging out from time to time and all the things that I was way older than most of them. So those things as like, hey, let's go clubbing and I was like no Im not doing that. So those kind of things played a huge role. And another thing when I got here I one of my ideas of one of the things I wanted to do was to blend into the pot, I need to blend into the Canadian culture. So, I remember I was telling my wife that I'm not gonna talk to anyone who speaks Spanish. You're the only one and just because we're married but I actually avoided Spanish speaking people because I wanted to, to improve my language. That was the main reason because I thought if I start hanging out with Mexicans, then I'm never going to be speaking English so how can I improve. How am I gonna get there? How am I gonna get the job. How am I gonna give it all back?. So, I avoided that. So my wife started, my wife was a little different. And she wanted to have some connection with the Mexicans society and the culture. So, she started hanging out with them. So most of the time I spent with the only people were talking Spanish with was my wife and my friends from here and my mom and my sister. Here I tried not to and it took me maybe a year to start realizing that I was being an idiot, so I started just hanging out. Now I don't care. The time it was my my idea was like, I need to do this because I when I moved I was 35 is like, boy, I'm already 35 I need to get a job, I need to to make things work for me right now. Because if not, I'm going to be 40 and then I'm going to still be in a shitty job. That was my idea at the time. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tTell me about the role of so in terms of giving you we discussed families as well and regulatory aspects of your migration. So government requirements that you had to fulfill. So this includes police checks, characters, points, test health requirements, immigration forums, any significant aspects of this or any challenges of this part. Then you remember what to put on your map?', '', '', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tThe main challenge that I got was when I had to get stuff from Mexico. Yeah, like it was for the PR. It was it was actually around this time after we got approved. There was a lot of stuff that we had to get from Mexico like, criminal record so bad. It's a pain because you either had to fly there and do it yourself or fill out bunch of papers to do it. And I'm completely forgetting something here, between the NAFTA and the PR. I got a bridge permit. Bridge corporate. So what happened is that my NAFTA was, was going to be expiring in May or something or April or May because every year, and but so we need a bridge work permit. So we apply I applied, actually the company did it because it was around here. So between this, they only need to say you need to apply for the PR, and you need to submit the documentation to reapply it and you get a bridge work permit. So I applied for that. It was kind of optional. But because there's another thing that's called implied status, I don't know if you've heard about now. So if your Work Permit expires, but you're already applied for the permanent residency you're legally working in living in Canada. But and it's but you cannot leave and come back you need to stay in Canada. But in this case, the one that I applied to the bridge, it's a permit that allows you to go back and forth. They need to travel. So I couldn't stay here because because work I need to go back and forth. But I have friends that they weren't able to go. They didn't apply for this because it costs money right? And when you're in my case, didn't matter because my company was paying for everything. But it costs more money and you're an immigrant usually are counting every penny so I have friends that didn't apply for this. They waited for a few months between their work permit expired all that and they couldn't leave the country. Actually here's a sad story. One guy that I know his father died and he couldn't go back to Mexico. If you leave, you need to wait outside the country to a resolution. it has it's flawless. Its getting better I think with the express entry and all that's getting way better. It's faster. Like if you think about it in 2010 or 2011 we applied, and it took us almost two years to get an invite for an interview two years from then. And if you think about it, I got the approval in four months with express entry. So, there's improvement. Express Entry started I think it was don't quote me on this but I think it started around here is when express interest started. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tin terms of challenges and obstacles, if there's anything else you think of please put that put that on there as well. But if that's kind of it, then\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tI think, honestly, I think my path to get the PR was very smooth. Because even though I had to go and go through all this work permits, I always had support from either my wife because she was making the money to pay for things, or the company. They didn’t sponsor me but they paid for lawyer. So in this sense, I would say I was very lucky. But because there's people that I think our issue was when wanted to go to leave Mexico as quickly as possible. That’s why we actually went through all this. If we didn't, we were like, okay, we'll stay in Mexico for a couple more years, then we would just get the invite for the PR, and then we just come in. And that's it. Yeah, we wanted to leave quickly. So we went through, I don't know how many work permits. So, the student permit, then the work permit. Then my two NAFTA permits, my bridge work permit, then my denial of the PR and then the PR. So I think I went through all the permits available. Laughs. But I mean, I suppose that the benefit of getting out of Mexico like and I would do it again.. For us was more important to leave the country than to do all this. I mean it’s a pain. Every time that you need to apply for a new work permit its like let me resurface all the documents that I sent last time. You need to keep track of every trip that you did. I used to travel a lot for work. So, it is a pain. I tried to avoid going back to Mexico. Mostly because… there's two things. Firstly, I hate spending my vacation in Mexico, because if I spend money and time and vacation days I want to go somewhere new. And second,  it's very stressful to go to Mexico so well, family My family is very close. Not my close family but my extended family - like my aunt's my uncle's, my cousins, and my wife's family like we get there and everybody wants to see which is super nice. It's really nice. I really love that, my friends is that where are you coming? Let's grab a coffee let's grab a beer. But that means that every day for as long as you're there, you have something to do. You have breakfast with someone, lunch with another person, dinner with another person, drinks with another one, coffee with another one. And then you met like five or six people on a day. And you get home and we should because one time we tried to stay at a hotel. And my mom was like, she felt that we dont want to stay with her. And we ended up cancelling the hotel and staying with our families. And that's the thing like you have to be with them. So, there's no time. There's no time to relax. Yeah, so that's the stressful part. Also, Mexico is growing violent. It was violent. It was it was the crime rate was really high when I left. Now, it's worse. So maybe It's the same amount crimes the problem is that there are harder crimes. Like before you someone like I got, I was mugged five times in Mexico City which is normal. I don't like I don't know anyone that lives in Mexico that hasn't been mugged or something. That’s normal. The problem is that when that happened I was younger and all that, they beat me a couple of times to take my wallet. Now people have started killing people to take their wallet or their watch or the car so I don't want to get killed because I'm driving a car. So those kind of things. And, and even before we started this, I was talking to one of my friends and he said he's a professor of one of the public universities in Mexico. And he was telling me like he was in the public transit to one of the one of the campuses, which is in one of the poorest parts of Mexico City, and someone can came, went into the bus with a gun and basically said, Hey, everybody give me what do you have. It's one of the poorest neighborhoods in Mexico City. How much money are they going to have? So, my friend just gave them their phone. And it said that it's criminals taking money out of the poor. And that didn't happen before. It was usually the crime didn't happen in poor areas, because the poor don't have, they don't have anything. So why would you not them? Now it's getting there. And now you see if you open a newspaper from Mexico, every day you have people killed somewhere at a party at a restaurant. So, going back for me and just living that it's kind of stressful.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo how do you feel then in How's your family being there? Will you will you eventually like like, will your family migrate here as well? Now that you hope to Yeah, you want to\", '', '', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tMy mom wants to come here when she retires. My sister, she's a writer. She's a freelancer so she can move anytime. And I don't know if they're going to do it. But it would be great. Yeah, I tell them. They're welcome. They told them like, you're welcome my home for not forever. But because it's a one bedroom. But at least you can stay here for a few months, and then we'll find something for you. And they know that. Anything I can do?, I’ll do it. I can support them with money or something. I'll do it. Yeah. I think it's more on my mom. I don't see it. I think her only concern right now is she loves her job as a teacher. And she loves her and she doesn’t speak English very well so she wouldn't be able to be a teacher here. Yes, a very good she she's in university. In actually the same in Brazil, my friend is works and she's a teacher there. And they just opened the Arts program and my mom is a writer and a painter. So, she's one of the ones that's opening the program and all that so, and for my mom, her professional career has always been very important. So, I think she would be quite dissatisfied if she did. I think she needs to complete her cycle. At some point. She's gonna say like, I'm done with university and moving here, but I need to wait for that. I can sponsor my mom, I cannot sponsor my sister. The only way that I could have sponsored, it’s another thing that I that's what I'm thinking that the Canadian cultures sometimes very conservative. The only way I can sponsor My sister is if I'm single, my sister single and our parents Dead.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd what about your wife's family?

Their family would be harder.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAll right, great. And I suppose now at any point if you use any support services, so and I'm talking about NGOs or welfare services or community organizations of religious organizations, were you ever involved with anything like that during your migration journey?\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tNo, no, I'm an atheist as a good leftist. So, I never then there was never involved in a religious organization, not NGOs. The only thing I did is when back so just 14 I started working here. So, I got this job at horizon where I'm working at. I started on March 2014, 2015. Yeah, I've been there, four and a half years. So, March 2015, I started working here, and I got fired from my other job, the HR HR job, I got fired on December 2014. So, between January, February, and half of March, I was under the Employment Insurance Program. Basically if you’re fired without cause there's a layoff or something like that. You can apply and They support you with certain amount. It's a percentage of what you're earning before up to a certain limit. Here's great because it actually, if I didn't have this, this is one of the things this is what I was telling you about taxes and if I hadn't had this, I think would be in Mexico right now. Because we were struggling. We were living on savings like be even even though my wife got a job look like it was a really bad job. Not a bad job was like an entry level job. Almost minimum wage. We had savings and and all that. Toronto is really expensive and you compare it any city in the world, but if you convert to Mexico, it's usually expensive, like back in Mexico. I had a two bedroom apartment and it was paying about, if you converted to Canadian dollars maybe like $400 in a really nice. When we got here we got a one bedroom in downtown for 1600 so it was four times and because that's that's one struggle that we had actually when we got here and actually I think I should mention when we got here we didn't know we didn't know anyone. So, when you apply for to be to rent, place they want you to get a warrant or because you don't have any credit score, any credit history anything. And because we didn't cover until we have to give six months, six months, six months rent. That's a significant amount of money. It was huge for us. It ate not half but about 30-40% percent of our savings. You get it back but promise that you you paid the deposit for. So you get the deposit here. And then this is a year, right? So, in theory, it's six months, right? But you need to create month one, month two, month three, month four, month five, and then the deposit starts counting here. So, you need to pay for six months and then keep paying the rent for the next six months. So, in the lapse of six months, you spent what you would be spending in a whole year. So, and that that sucks. Right now, one of my friends just moved here from his from he was living in Boston. And he was he just moved here, and they were asking you for four months in advance. So, I told him Don't do that. I'll be you want to just please don't destroy the apartment so spoke to me. But I helped him because it's ridiculous when you're moving from a country that it's not this expensive it just it just hurts. It hurts you really bad. We found an option with Scotiabank. Scotiabank has a huge presence in Latin America. So they had an option called smart drivers, it was some program. If you open an account in Mexico, you could move all your money without paying any fees or anything. So what we did we open an account in Scotiabank, Mexico, we just move all our money there. And then the week before we moved here, we just move all the money here. So we didn't pay any fees. That was great. That was one of those great things because if not, then we were basically screwed. That's another thing when I said that its conservative and, you know, elitist. Yeah, because you asking like, okay, you want to move here first, you get points because you have a university degree, you get points because you have experience working, you get points because you all that stuff, you come here to do this thing, you're young, and you need to have money to do this kind of things and all that. So that leaves most of the people who actually need to leave their countries behind. So, I was fortunate enough to have savings, to have a degree to have experience all that, that I was a good candidate for Canada. But if you live in Mexico and you're not by you know, you weren't able to go to school, you weren't able to go to private school and you don't have a good job, you’re screwed.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tNow, what are the sort of next steps for you future? What are you going to do now? Like next steps in terms of migration next steps in terms of life course as well? Like, what are you looking forward to?', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tnext steps like a generic next step like life, professional life, profession, and migration. Yes, I'm trying to apply in January for citizenship. And the reason is because in October, we it's two years. I'm pretty sure you know this, but if you were temporary residents before, you're going to remember, isn't it? You can get like a bonus one year from before. So it's one year from before plus two years and permanent residency. And the idea for me and my wife would be, so this up to so in January 2020 we want to apply for citizenship. So that's the migration thing. After that, I might stay here. I want to stay here. I would like to run every like the city. I really like the quality of life. But then again, it goes to who just saying like you. I love living in downtown, because it's super convenient. But so expensive. It says like, the problem with that is that it goes with what we were saying is that you need a, really, really good job which pays a shit ton of money. So it just goes around with I was saying like, if you have money then you get the best of the city, which I'm fortunate enough to have right now. I just think I've been really lucky with my path here. The job that I got the company I'm with when I joined over less than 20 people. Now we're like 60, and I was able to grow with the company. So, I started as a product manager. Now I'm a senior director. So I mean, I think that's, I was really, really lucky to get that. So that gives me the opportunity to live here to earn enough money to to enjoy Toronto. If you don't have any money, don’t have a good job, you have to live somewhere far like Scarborough and you need to take the Go train in the morning and you need to get here and youre commute is like an hour and a half. Know that. So those kind of things is it just goes back to what I'm saying about it's a really embracing culture in the lab, but it's still very elitist. You need money, you need studies, you need to be young, you need to be a certain type of person to actually enjoy the city. I never wanted kids. So this is now. So, as I said, January 2020, is citizenship. We're planning to buy a home maybe this year hopefully. We've been saving through to for example payment. Again, we want to live in downtown so it's even more expensive than I think so we're looking into I think, because we want at least a one bedroom apartment were you talking about like over half a million dollars so so I saw one that I loved was a two bedroom plus den, two bathrooms was a $1 million plus den. You know what, like the you know, like, for example this in my apartment is you enter here. This is the kitchen. Yeah. And we have a sink here and it's open and then you have kind of like the living room/dining room. And then we have a door here and then we have the bedroom and here is the washer. A den is basically a space where it's open. There's no door. And you can use it as a small office or guest room but it has no door. Okay? That's the definition. It's like, Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be mostly for us. So we're gonna be like a small office. Oh, that's what we're looking looking into it so we want to buy a condo. I wanted to be one bedroom, plus den. That's that's my idea. As I said downtown. That's something that I think we have enough money to for the down payment and start something that Let's see, this is really expensive. Professionally, I like my job. So I'm pretty sure I'm gonna stay there for a while. So I would say by professionally, there's no change. No change. But I'm doing side projects. So that's one of the things that have been missing. I started the podcast, yeah. And then continue with that. My goal is to interview 100 immigrants. Maybe after 100 I give up or not, but that's the goal. It's in two years. I wanted to meet 100 people. And I'm also writing. One of my short stories is going to be published soon. It's It's it's a parody of an immigrant from Mexico. So his name is Jesus because it makes it it's a very common name, but it's spelled Jesus. So, people make fun of his name because they know your name is Jesus in, in an Anglophone country, nobody's going to be named never gonna name the baby Jesus. Jesus is very company. He needs to explain love of Mexico that and then he is getting a job interview for an entry level job, but he's very stubborn and arrogant. So he doesn't want to get an entry level job. He thinks that he's the Big Shot. He's been a year without a job because he's looking for the top. Like, he's gonna He's going for the major leagues, but he doesn't have the skills and nobody wants to hire him. And then he gets divorced. It’s a take a very dark humour. Its being published by the immigrant writers association. So actually, if you listen to my first episode of podcast, I don't know if you listen to you listen to the first one. The first one, I interviewed the founder of that.  So it's funny because I started it just from college, I started taking a vacation program in creative writing. And I started writing that as, as part of the, of the school project. And at some point, I became a member of this association and they launched, they were asking for people to submit their stories for because they want to, they wanted to create the first anthology and it was going to be stories about immigration. Like I already have this. I just need to polish it and send it so I worked with some of my friends from school, polished it and sent it. They liked it. And it's gonna be one of 10 chapters in the book. I started writing of a young age, but I never pursue writing as a career. My mom is a writer, my sisters writer. So for me was just like, normal. I also take, I am like an amateur photographer as well. So, I do a lot of those kind of things. So yeah, that's, that's another thing. I'm going to continue pursuing my writing right now. Right now I'm writing a novel as well. So, I'm going to say novel. Yeah. Most of my short stories are like that. And like, I try to make people laugh, but my novel is a sci fi action dystopian novel. So it's a little different.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\twould you consider migration elsewhere?', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tI could, um, yeah, absolutely. I just would do it a little different. I would. I would be, I guess, I guess the difference right now. I wouldn't be escaping from my country. So if I consider something now, I would think a little more and maybe don't go the way I came like, I left everything and lets see what life gives us here. I think if I move somewhere else I would be a little more careful and be like okay I need a job I'm going to go get a job and it has to be something that is really is fulfilling not like the first job I have something that's fulfilling and but I would consider I would completely consider moving and there's places that I would love to move. Mostly Europe, Europe, mostly UK. I would love to live in the UK. London To be honest, is my favorite city in the world. So that I haven't been so yeah, I would imagine it would be great. I've been there so many times. So many like three before four times. But it's still like you think about me like I I don't come from I my family's not wealthy. That also made the first time I left Mexico. I was 27-28 I never left my country and there was 28 years old.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd where did you go ', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tCuba.And then the next time I left was when I was I got married to my wife. And no, no, before we got married, we wanted to cruise to the Caribbean. So, the second time, and then we got more many more here and then I started traveling a lot. But what I'm trying to say is that traveling is are quite expensive. So I never did it when I was young. I never, I always dreamed about we're going to grab a backpack, I'm going to tour Europe with a bag, but I never did that. So now when I travel, I travel with a backpack but it's different because it's now because I know that I have a job that I'm coming back to a job at the time. It's like I'm just gonna grab a backpack in travel the whole whole Europe and maybe Asia for for a year and see what happens but never never did it. Yeah, but yeah, I would consider migrating but it just would be a little more. I wouldn't say careful because I think it was careful with me here. I think it would be more picky in the sense that it has to be a place that I really want to go, and I need to get a job I really want. And that's like kind of like I actually got a job offer a few months ago for the US, California, And I said no. Two things first, I didn't I didn't want I don't want to leave before I get my citizenship and also in the United States, and it's not a good time to be Mexican in the United States, even though I don't have Mexican. And my accent is, I have an accent but its not that Mexican-ish. So I will be okay. And it's California. I completely get it. But still the US. I don't want to live in a country where you have Trump as president.\", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tI mean, if you if you have nothing else to add, but I suppose I have I always have this final question when people draw a map. How do you feel looking at all of this now?', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tWell, first I feel…I feel like really happy. I never I mean, I knew I did all this. I knew I applied to all this things. But I'm, its the first time I put it in somewhere and I can see it. It's like, there's so many steps that I did to get where I am now. So yeah, it's like, Wow. I remember it was it was it was very stressful. Every time that my I think the most stressful times was when I lost my job. And I knew I needed to get a job by June, or may or the summer because my work permit was expired. And I  needed to get a job in my field to apply for the NAFTA extension. That was so stressful. And now that I look back I was like, I was like I feel like, it's it's a strange feeling because it's physically like I want to cry because I remember those times I remember how stressful it was but also I remember the time when we got here. And we had we didn't have any furniture and we were sleeping in an inflatable mattress because we were waiting for the furniture to arrive. And like just a feeling of a fresh start was so invigorating. If you look at the picture of me when I arrived, and a picture of me two months before in Mexico City, I look like five years older in the in the in the picture from Mexico City. Like I think the stress in Mexico. You know Everything just made me look way older. Oh my god, I felt so renewed and all that. And I remember thinking, it's like nobody knows who I am here. I can be whoever I want. I have no baggage. I can do anything I want. Yep. And that's feeling I think it was. I think only someone that's actually gone through the migration process knows what it feels like. To look at this and that kind of reminds me this time when we started deciding because which we actually the reason we we started thinking about moving was because I had a company in Mexico we went bankrupt, lost everything so it was like shit, I need something I need a fresh start. So it's kind of tired of the whole thing. So it's just looking at this is just has been quite a journey. Has it been worth it? Yeah. So I mean, that's that that's that's the thing, right that happy at the end of it. So that's good. And yeah, um, look, I mean, I, I don't really have any more questions, you've pretty much covered everything but is there anything that you you think I should have asked that I didn't ask? I suppose the one thing that I do maybe want to talk about, is you providing advice. Do you give migration advice to people? I suppose through your podcast, that's one avenue that you do. I kind of do through podcast but I just started with this good podcast. Before, I'm usually very open to anyone who like for example, someone contacts me through LinkedIn. I always reply and say like, Hey, can we have a coffee? Can you tell me? I just thought I was them at some point. So I know. I know the struggle. I know the desperation that you feel that this is not going the way I wanted it to go. So, Yeah, I'm always open to that. And that's the reason why I started the podcast. Because I wanted to give something back to. I would, I would. I think what I want to say is like, I would want to give back what I would like to have would have liked to have back then when I started the migration process. Like someone, and that's what I'm focusing on the stories of normal people's like, everybody's struggling. You're not the only one with the issues. Yeah, everybody has issues.M:\\tSo let's just begin with when you say Don't worry about this yet. We'll get started later. But when did you first migrate to Canada? \", '', '', '', 'Az:\\tlast year August -2018.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what were the motivations behind you move?', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tLove. My husband, hes here. We had the option of because I had a great career and focus on so we had an option for him to either keep coming down and visiting me while I was working in history in my career. But I just felt that that would be like, you know, we would have been like a year or two into our marriage and then I would move here and it would be like we're starting. I think it would just have mixed up our timeline. So I just decided to create a new year. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAlright, and yeah, what was the work that you were doing that what's your professional background? \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tSo, I work in non-profits. I started one of Pakistan's largest non-profit networks, which is called the free and fair election network which is based on democracy and governance. I worked in that area…the non-profit area for about seven years. I went to the States to study going back to Pakistan. I worked with a corporate for three years and innovation, digital innovation and change management. Then I moved to a news channel Hum News and I joined as an anchor person. But while I was there, I had met my husband, so I realized I probably wouldn't be able to go through and it was wrong to the channel. So, I changed my role. Oh, and so I was heading the Research Unit over there. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOh, that's amazing. And what did you study like in terms of your education, oh, and \", '', '', '', 'Az:\\tmy masters was an MPA - public Administration with a concentration in politics and my undergrad I did development studies with a major in gender studies and minor in economics.

So I help organizations manage their customer experience based on the digital experience. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOh, that's amazing.

Like, I mean, so can you tell me a little bit about him where you met him? \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tRight. So, he is here. He has his tutoring business with his brother so they do. They help McGill and Concordia students on their undergraduate students – their ubndergrad business students. How we met is our parents. His mom and my mom.

And from then it was our story. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOh, great. And how long have you been married for now? ', '', '', '', 'Az:\\tA year ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay. So Did you know Did you were you I mean, considering that you studied in the states before? Were you considering perhaps living elsewhere outside of Pakistan for the rest for your life? ', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tYeah, yeah, I was already looking at Canadian immigration because I came here for about three months and 2017, I liked it. And I thought I might move but I and I was in Montreal for only three days. So, it was a consideration but my first preference was the states. Right. But once you've left, getting back in with a job is more difficult than yours there as student and continue to find work. But yeah, I think Just it worked out. I was going to apply for a Canadian immigration anyway. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd could you have lived in the states the time you studied there? Like could you have actually moved on to another visa and stayed there? ', '', '', '', 'Az:\\tNo, I was on a Fulbright scholarship. So all right, I gotta go back. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tYeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, great. Tell me a little bit about your family and their role in your move. I mean, considering I'm introduced you kind of Yeah. \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tYeah, no, my mom always knew that. I wouldn't like none of us lives in books. And my brother lives in London, UK. You have to say that here because it's London, Ontario as well. My sister lives in Melbourne. So, even when I moved to the States, she knew that I wouldn't probably go back to Pakistan. one in every continent. One in every time zone. So, my father passed away when I was seven years old. And I've been raised more by my mom single handedly. So I'm a product of hermevery way. So yeah, So I am…I am the closest to my mom. My brother, my sister. Left, got married left, got married and left when I was in my teens. my brother left when I just shortly after I turned 20 I think so. Yeah. So it's mostly just been me and my mom.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\t And do you have any friends or community here before you move? I know you had your husband.', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tIn Toronto I had family. Yeah. My uncle and his kids daughters who I’m very close to so I had them but nobody in Montreal. It's the only family we have in Montreal is my husband’s brother and his wife. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, great. There's some family. That's good. And in terms of the initial visa process, how long did that take? \", '', '', '', 'Az:\\tOh, actually, well. I already had a visit visa for this 10 years when when because I had come here earlier.

And then I would still decide if I wanted to just go back. So the initial one was actually a visit. So I did come on a visit visa. And then when I came here, i came early summer, so that's a good time to come to Montreal. Just grew on to me, and then I contacted my work people and everybody and I was just like, I think I'm going to stay here. I don't think I'm going to go back. So and we just checked if it was legal for me to do that. And it was so that \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOh, that's amazing. So pretty much right after you got married you. \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tYeah, like within a week. Yeah. Oh, that's amazing. And you're you got married in August. Yeah, yeah. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, great. And last name in this question is basically about this research project is about skills migration. You don't have to be on a skilled visa like I clarified before, but how do you consider yourself to be skilled.\", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tYeah, I did. I did do like when I was applying for the immigration initially, I did do the skills thing. So, I think I used to score something like, for Canada, I don't know what the minimum is. But it used to be something like 150 to 160 points, which was well above the average mean. So, I don't know what that means. If that answers your question. Okay, So in that sense, like, because I have a very diversified portfolio of work, so I don't have like, I don't I don't think I'd be able to say like, I have a skill in like carpentry or so but I do have like very strong editorial analytical skills. I have writing skills. I write a blog for one of these non-profits which works on mental health. I'm working with this other non-profit which works with foster children. So I helped to give them life skills such as just being a budget and you know, preparing the resume. So, I have those I have. I have mentoring skills. And so yeah, because I'm more of a generalist, it's something that I can I can fit in a lot of areas, basically. Yeah. So, I don't know, if I start to list them down. I feel like it's gonna be kind of like tooting my own horn. But also I know that it's multifaceted. Right so like I mean domestically I think it's I pretty much do everything I can I change the bulbs. I can I cook I clean? It's a Yeah, I don't think there's except for like heavyweight. I'm pretty adept at everything that goes on in our place. I'm also one of those people who changes like the electricity voltage things and like makes a three pin plug to a two pin plus do that stuff like that. So that and technologically I'm pretty good technologically just get it mixed up. So I like that's a natural inclination to it.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd what's the married life dynamic like living away from home? away from home? \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tI don't think I feel that too much because I just I was very independent when I was home as well. So if you like, yeah, my mom came to visit and that was good. She was here for a couple of months. And that flew by pretty quickly. So I feel like I was already living one person then now I'm still living with one person. It's just different in the sense that this person I'm getting to know more and more every day. Yeah. And because he's a guy and I feel like in all of my childhood, because my father also passed away pretty early on the only male presence, I had was my brother’s. And he also left pretty early on like when I was just 20. So I don't really remember much about guy habits. When I moved here I was very like, interesting to me. And I thank God that I have a brother because when I used to visit his house in London like over the summers I get I'd start to clean up this place and then I'd have to stop myself that I'm on vacation and I'm here to do this. So, women generally I feel like just have a natural inclination to be more organized and more clean or like keeping a place a pretty good. Yeah, so what I moved here like my apartment was full of boxes. And I asked my husband if he just moved in. And he said, No. And he had told me before he came that he was cleaning up the apartment and because the lease was ending, so I thought he packed it up. But it turns out, that's how it used to be like, forever. There was just boxes everywhere. And, and I also realized that he has a very different way of organizing things. So, this is the closet. It's a closet. Now, it doesn't matter if it's in the kitchen, or the room or the bathroom. It's a closet. So, you will find things which will be like, Why is this here? And then you realize it's a closet, it doesn't matter where it is. So, there would be things completely like the kitchen drawer would have like tools in it, and I’d be like shouldn’t this be anywhere else except here. so I realized like it was a bulb which went off in my head when I realized  that for him a drawer is a drawer. It's not where it is. It's just a drawer. It's a place to put things. So he, in general, he does agree that he's a bit weak at organizing, but he but for me, that was a completely new way. So I realized like, and for him, like, if it was messy, and he was fine, you know, he didn't really like even if it was a bit dirty. He was still fine. It didn't really matter to him basically. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\t So and your husband's from Pakistan as well. Yeah. Yeah. \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tBut he lived there for like, I guess. Max 10 years of his life. Yeah, he's been he was in America, and then he moved here. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo awesome. Great. Okay. So we'll go into the mapping part of it. I do want to clarify that at any point, if you don't want to answer something, or you think that you want to remove that from the transcripts, that's completely fine. We can do that as well. Okay. So, all right. So I'll basically as You two questions and you will just draw it out. And then this whole thing will be recorded, and we can talk through you talk through your drawing. Okay? The drawing is completely up to you; however you want to do it. So from the initial sort of point of leaving Pakistan, I I in your case, I suppose it is about going to study as well in the US, right? \", '', '', '', 'Az:\\tWell just to mention I grew up in Africa. So, I moved to Pakistan when I was eight years old. So, for me Pakistan never really felt like home. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tExcellent. So let's put that on the map as well. So let's just talk about all of the places that you've been and all of the kinds of statuses like the visa status that you've been okay, I guess that's Let's begin with that. \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tOkay, so all right. So lets just make like...That's Africa. That is Asia.. Here is your Australia and I have no clue what North America looks like it says this big blob over there. So, here is my.. Botswana. Yeah. And then here would be Pakistan…here is going to be Philly and then we're going to move Montreal so those are the four countries well that's a city where I have lived in USA, Canada should be in red. Okay, so that's that's Africa. Yeah, Asia. So, in Botswana I was there for zero to seven years. Pakistan, I moved in 1992 to 2011 and then from 2013 to 2018. Philly is 2011 to 2013. Canada is 2018 to now. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tExcellent. This is such a great representation and loving it already. So you grew up in Botswana because your family was there?', '', '', '', 'Az:\\tMy father was working there before I was born. my mom was expecting me. So he moved there, and he thought it was was good. and then he was able to call us. So I was still like about three months or so when we moved there.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo yeah. And do you remember like what it was like? ', '', '', '', 'Az:\\tOh yeah, I went back in 2012 to volunteer there. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tOh, you do. So yeah. Oh, that's amazing. Awesome. All right. Okay, now we'll talk about your sort of migration journey. I suppose this might have to do more with your education in the US and also with Canada and moving so I wanted to ask you about commercial services that you used throughout. So, things that you paid for, which are legends, lawyers, document translation services, language tests, internships, anything that you had to pay for in your move, maybe more recently, maybe either Canada or both Canada and us.\", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tOkay, so here [Botswana] it was not paid for. Yeah. Okay. And over here. This part is also not paid for [US]. Yeah, because you're Yes. And this part when I got to get here  - GRE. And the TOEFL. GRE is to get into any school and TOEFL is because even if you had an English medium education, you're going from Pakistan so they need to be able to tell. So at some point, though, I know that I did take the IELTS X 2. Once way earlier when I was thinking of immigrating to Australia in around 2009, I think okay. And once I took it right now, when I was thinking of coming to Canada So I was twice because that's a requirement for Yeah. And then when I moved to Canada, we consulted with the lawyer twice. But I did all the paperwork myself. So just a lawyer fee, which was, I don't know, $200 for 100 for every time so it wasn't too much. So yes, but every country I have visited in my life. Yes. Okay. Visits is equal to visas paid for. And that would be about – because it’s a Pakistani Passport. So I pay for every country's visa, right. So it's going to be at least.. I paid for at least like 30 countries..30 times. So that's a cost, but I have never consulted anybody for paperwork. That's only in Canada – background checks. Because of my immigration. That's all because to the US, I was on a scholarship from the US Department. So, I got waived for a lot of the costs than anybody else was going to the US to study…they would have many more of the loops and hoops. So, for me till now it's the lawyer, the police, The medicals, not yet, if they asked me it's not necessarily for everybody. When you do your PR it's a spousal one so it depends. Some people …they skip. Oh, yeah, I did do it. For the Australian visa I did do the medical test for the visit visa. No, they made my mom do it. Not me. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, and what about the immigration to Australia? Like, did you like what happened to that? Cuz considering that you were thinking a move in 2009 I got the in 2010. ', '', '', '', 'Az:\\tIn 2010 I got the scholarship. So that fell through. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay. All right. We'll move on then. Tell me about the role of technology in your migration. And what I mean is everything that you use tech for. So online searches, what resources you used, what social media you used, your own a particular groups. Also what technology you use. Today maybe to navigate in a new place you know.\", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tSo, all of this - 1999 onwards is all tech dependent. If there wasn’t tech, especially in particular internet, I wouldn't be here basically. So what I use right now - let's go backwards because it's more fresh - Now I use Facebook for Canada spousal group, spousal support group. Its excellent. Nobody posts any junk on there. Then theres an online support group. These guys on online support group you can just post a random question and but you may or may not get an answer back I'm forgetting what the name is but it's anonymous support group “apply Canada immigration” something like that yeah some days it comes up as a first search what you do it. After moving here or even before moving here so always flights are always looked up online, flighthopper is a great tool, visa requirements are always looked up online, college applications, full bright application, undergrad, all of that work, Almost, except for the employments I created myself on the, job applications. Even like when you find your way just general maps Yeah. Kajiji for a lot of shit. Even if like right now like the blog I work for a link to community management stuff that I do. I helped organize it's all Online. So, it's because I'm new in the city and I don't know many people. So, everything that we are finding and my husband is more of an introvert he doesn't know a lot of people. So, everything I do is like, by going online, do it. So if I didn't, that's what I feel like I feel like if I don't even understand how women did this by doing these moves before us. Like I don't know what they went through because they'd write home a letter in the received one like a month later. So I just absolutely have this amazing respect for what they’ve actually been through. If you're depressed. Are you looking for something else? You do this? You know? That's where you turn to either. Just place a search. The world's at your fingertips? Absolutely. So for me if there's no net, there's no life, basically.  I mean, I met some people somebody, like, met through the net. I found like a job fair. I'm coming back and I'm going forward. So on the job for found one, I made one lead and went to one of their sessions. And that led to two leads. And that's how I think it goes through basically. So that's one and then one of the social works that I do. I found it was recommended by a friend who knew about them – Vent over tea. I love this place. Its mental health places. Basically, you go online, you book a venting session with somebody who's trained in active listening and you get an hour. I write a blog for them. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd do you think that language plays a role here because considering that Montreal being a very French part of town…', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tI think when you're new here you think that French is absolutely essential. As you leave here more and more you realize it's not that essential. You see job opportunities and you get disheartened because most of like all of them always say bilingual, but you realize that through experience that is by law, there are required to write that on job descriptions. When they write bilingual they are actually looking for somebody who speaks English. So, but I have learned French. I am still learning and I manage to have a basic conversations like shopping in French, I can talk to people, I can tell directions, like shop for groceries or anything I need. So yeah, I think I've picked up the language\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tGreat okay and where do you learn French? ', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tOh, so first I was here at the YMCA for like two months and then I realized it wasn't helping me much. Then I joined one of the we works and that was all right. Now I move towards more government different places so I go to of archives national Quebec what's called a bank OBNQ. So, I go there for classes which are free once a week, which are only in conversation for French. And then I do at Dawson college, I go Mondays Tuesdays. The Dawson ones are not free, but they're almost like, what they asked for is very small. When I went to the summer, to the ones which the government offers, they told me my work permit did not qualify for it because it's an open work permit. But somebody I met just now. [Draws] This has saved my life. One of the persons told me that now they do accept it. So because she has just started it. So I feel like the meetup groups really helped. Again, I think if there weren’t meetup, I wouldn't have found a lot of people in a lot of places. The friends I did make though, I found them in my French classes. And so I just feel like the one or two people, friends in recommended, like, oh, you're going to Montreal. You know my sister lives there. And I was already a bit like, because I know me and my sister were poles apart. So, if somebody is her friend, most likely they're not gonna my friend and vice versa. Somebody who recommended me their sister and when I met her, I was just like, I'm friends with you, not your sister. I just it's not necessary. But another friend of mine, his sister moved here and we got along pretty good. So I think it has to do with the fact that he's a male and she's a female. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo I mean, I thought was kind of going to go into the next question that I had is about social connections so friends, family or greater community that have supported you in your move here. And if there's anything that from there that you want to put on your map\", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tSo I feel like I am a very independent person. I have always been a very independent person and everybody was, more than advice, everybody was very sure that I'd make friends in no time and then again, you know, I'd be on my feet. When I moved here, I thought I would need friends. But initially, I didn't want to be friends, like look up or go seeking friends. Like, I just wanted to be on my own. Because it was not just a physical, geographical change, but it was also change in my marital status. So I wanted to, you know, understand the dynamic of this relationship I was going to be in. Nobody hands you a JD for how to be a wife. What is it going to be like. And you just pretty mimic what your parents did. That’s the only training manual you have. So, I feel like it would be very helpful if my husband has been more supportive, okay. And I feel like he should have had some tools to help him understand what I would go through…for example, well, because he has his life going on here. And, of course, nobody's asked to reorganize all his life here. But he, to understand that his presence would be important, and in a meaningful way, not just being physically present mentally absent. So I feel like something like that would have been very helpful for me. And if he had, I do believe that if he had known about a resource like that, he would have reached out to me before I came, so that just give me an idea.\", '', '', '', \"[I'm gonna make a start up along those lines. So I'm thinking about multiple things think that you can use this paper if you want. Okay? Actually, I do keep making notes. So I'm just because I create things myself. That's what I do.]\", '', '', '', \"So I think that's a great resource as well as for anybody who's new, for partners. So before they come in here, because it's it's like I had to find everything, you know, and because I'm a woman, like he just showed me like, heres the pharmacy, heres the grocery store. And the rest was just like, I'm going back to work. So who do I meet? Like, you know, and I feel like also because his and my personality styles are so different. Like, within one year, I feel like I've almost made more friends than he would even like to have, you know what I mean? Because he doesn't have many friends and his friends are not necessarily going to be my friends. And I would rather not because I would like him to have his time doing his thing. So yeah, so I think that it's just really important that does have to be and for me, I didn't know who to reach out to, if I needed support. So even when I went online, I didn't like and it's also I think some of the part of you doesn't really want to admit that you want support. Yeah. So you're, you're not willing to do that in the beginning. So yeah, so it's like any place it's not easy to move to a place when you when you're somebody who's used to having a like a full schedule, and like work, you know, all engines burning basically. And then you just move in this all really down to zero and you also have a perception that it's all French. But it's not. But for me, I like the French perception because it's kind of pushed me into learning a language I always wanted to learn anyway. And for me, it's not just to learn language I can get along it's for me to it's more like to read more books or literature in French and actually get an understanding because it just opened up a whole new world so I already do write like small stuff in French and I manage all right, because I write stories so I write those in French and I find myself thinking in French already. So yes, so language does play a role and I feel like either you would embrace it or let it deter you, and it's all up to you. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd did you actually have these conversations with your husband that, you know,', '', 'like in terms of support and in terms of ', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tYeah, I feel like he does agree that he could have done a better job, but how he could have done it. He could he doesn't know. And so I don't blame him for that. We’re both lost. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tBut anyway, alright, cool. Um, how did your decision to move? But I suppose you've kind of answered that before. But do you have a very close connection with your family? And did that affect your mom, for example, that you were moving and \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tMy mom somebody who's like, I know that it didn't affect her, but she had, even when I was there, she had a routine. She has a very strong network of friends and family and she's she's…And she did 2 years without me any way. Two years without me when I was in the States. So she kind of like, already knew that. But the thing is, when I was in the States, she was still working. And she retired the year I got back. So, for her, but she still is very regimented. So, she’ll get up at a certain time every day. She has her whole routine. So even when I was in Pakistan, like, if I came back from work earlier, she was like, okay, you're home, but I have things to do. So, we're going to sit together at the time we sit together every day. So, like, and that was good to see because it just showed me that she's going to be fine without me and she is so she's a very, she's a she's a very strong and she's she's because she's so independent. She's always promoted us to be like, you know, raised us to be very independent individuals as well. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo that's great, okay. All right. So I suppose the mapping part of it is is kind of done.\", '', 'I do have some more questions that you can potentially think about putting on your map. First, these regulatory aspects of your migration you did talk about police checks and you have put it already but any other government requirements that you have to fulfill so characters or points or health or immigration forums or anything that was kind of very government based that you had to let do get ', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tWe did have to get like there was one stamp on our because we got our Nikanama in English as well. But there was one stamp in Urdu which we got translated. So, and the guy was like, very sweet. He's didn’t even charge us for it. We didn't even know him. We found him online. But he just said, we also wrote for him but the translation was, so he just had to stamp it. That was here. I mean, we did have to go through Of course, we had to do the PR papers, the PR paperwork and the work permit paperwork. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo the PR paperwork and the work so what's your status now? Are you on a work permit only or PR? \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tMy PR is approved in principle. Its called AIP and work permit is to 2021 which means my extension to stay and stuff I have my driver's license, health card everything by now. It took it's time, but it's here now. The paperwork itself is this one is the worst paperwork I've done in my life. I could have applied to five universities in that one paperwork – that’s how much it was because we've been married for less of less than a year when we applied we had to actually prove that this was a legitimate real marriage. It wasn't just done for the sake for getting an immigration. So, we had to give them like photos and they have a cap on photos so we had to be really like smart about the kind of… we had to thik really out of the box in terms of what we give them.. like actual evidence so like we give them photographers contract for the wadding, we gave them permission slips for wedding shoots. The good thing about Pakistan is now that it's pretty becoming pretty regimented and people give you like receipts of the cake, the wedding catering, and everything. So, we had that, and  everything's in English. So we gave them the gym membership for here and then you know that we're both coming here together, opening a bank account they needed…they had absolutely required a joint bank account and me being on a Pakistani passport on a visit visa none of the banks was actually giving us that because they're just like, No, we don't give it to visitors even for joint, so that was like such a catch 22 because we just kept going round and round and I didn't even know which banks were here and then just searching that and thinking out of the box kind of thing. And I basically I think I thought of that only because I had lived in the US and I thought okay they should be able to give me a bank account based on my own nationality and sort of my visit visa and that's how I thought of like an International Bank. So this paperwork’s a bitch, I swear, we have had so many fights and doing this and almost when I went on the support group page, all couples have had fights doing this so we were thinking they should put a checkbox underneath and saying, how many fights did you have one completing this because you're not gonna do this for anybody unless you really love them to be honest. It's that bad. And even though I’m doing inland I think Outland I don't know how land is because you stay away from your spouse most likely for like two years and that is probably hell added on hell. For us because I was hearing a reason you can only set stay at six months stretch. So the deadline was approaching. So it was more like we do this or goodbye. So we were able to like keep our eyes on the prize in terms of like, No, we mean more than the paperwork. This is a mountain a molehill, and a mountain in the way, and because we've been another long distance relationship for six months before we got married, so we, we'd already done that, and we didn't want to go through that again. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAre you are you on top of immigration policies do follow news, the regards to immigration policies? And do you have anything to say about that? No, no, I didn't really follow them. I was.\", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tNo, I don't, I don't really unless they do something like crazy. I don't really follow it too much. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, great. And I suppose you did kind of mention this, maybe this might have been your biggest challenge. But overall, throughout your journey, looking at your map, what was some of the biggest challenges or obstacles that you would want to point out and put on your map.', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tI feel like in getting here I was pretty okay because I was already like, pretty sick of where I was and I knew that I had to move so in getting here there was not like, for me it wasn't an obstacle to choose like, Oh, you know I love this place too much and I cant give it up. It never felt like home to me and I was perfectly fine moving away. So, and surprisingly the only city in the in my entire life I've lived in four as you can see, and Montreal has actually felt like home pretty instantly. But I feel like the biggest obstacle I felt when I got here was because I have seasonal affective disorder. And the fact that the winter here is pretty harsh and as much as I love the winter actually, s.a.d, plus, my husband's I don't know, lack of awareness of I don't even know how to put it in a good way like, because I don't blame him for it, that's the thing and I don't hold it against him. But his kind of like the fact that his ignorance and him having a full load of work kind of like timed at the same time as winter hitting in, you know, so because his work is very seasonal. And this and the next semester are his main two semesters. So, I feel like his his business or his life carrying on basically which I cannot absolutely grudge the person or Yeah, so his business plus sad so the timing of that was probably like the worst combination. Yeah. And this year, like as it starts to become when you get close to winter, I almost dread it because it's almost traumatic to think that this cannot be a repeat of the last year. Yeah, right. So see, so a lot of people just say that we have winter blues. All right, okay. Right. But then people who have seen winter blues is something like almost everybody faces because the sun is nowadays are getting shorter to get less sun time and everything. But seasonal affective disorder is when people actually almost move into a depressive state. And you have to like, like I had learned to manage it in Pakistan as well because I would you know, up the ante on my physical activity and everything but here there were some essential vitamins which I wasn't aware of, and I should have started taking them…I should have started way earlier. So, I feel like that affected because they affect the chemistry of you. So that and the fact that you know, I didn't know anybody, so I didn't have a motivation to get out of the house. So, I mean, I mean, when it's snowing everybody wants to stay in any way. Right. And it's beautiful from inside, but I feel like it's beautiful outside as well. But if only if you have like, a purpose to get out, yeah, I just didn't have a real and like for me because I mean, I was living right here is a good thing and a bad thing. Because if I had to go to the gym, I would just run from there to here. Right. So I didn't even have to wear any winter gear on something. I just sprint and I'd be in here then I just went out. But I came here I went to the gym. I didn't really talk to anybody. And the fact that I had very low human interaction, and somebody like me who's extroverted really needs a lot of human interaction. So that and then so the human interaction factor, like very decreased and then the time zone change because everybody back home was like, 12 hours at a difference from you. Yeah so even if I go on everybody it like my friends and you know the fact that you know you you're not there and you see lives moving on basically. Yeah, you have that's the negative of Facebook, and social media that you're able to see things happening and you're not there. it's a con in that sense, the connection is not there. Like, your friends are meeting up the way they used to, like you see their stories. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAny bad advice - In your move through your move after move?', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tYeah, I think everybody was kind of like now that you mentioned like, I've never really thought of like any advice I got. But when you mentioned it, like, I don't think I got good or bad advice. I just didn't get advice. And I think that that itself is not a good or bad thing. Like it may be more of a bad thing, because I just didn't get any advice. I think I feel like either. Everybody just looks at me and thinks that knowledge. Yeah, because I've learned from a very young age to steer my way. So, either everybody's perception of me Is that she should be fine or are they just don't know what to say. So yeah I don't think. I feel like there should have been some something. I feel like my sister in law was had moved to London from to be with my brother. And she like only now like after a year she mentioned that yeah, it feels like you're just you're just reborn you have to do all these driving test again you have, you're basically starting your life is scratch and I feel like, something, a conversation along those lines with somebody would have been helpful. And any of his friends wives that I met, were also not too forthcoming. Now they are not earlier because they didn't know me, or they didn't know him too well. And they didn’t know what to say basically. So, so I feel like it would have, I just feel like there wasn't much conversation happening. That's why I'm taking notes because I am considering of building this on on a side of talk to one of these organizations as well, where I can actually hold workshops and have mentors and stuff. So I’m thinking of doing something for women who are or even men who are place like me. I feel like I've got like so much like, that's what my first blog was about, like how to prepare for the winter, that's exactly what it says. It's about winter blues, basically. But I there's a disclaimer about SAD at the bottom. So, it's basically trying to give those tips to people that I do do now and that have worked for me. Yeah, so it's so I do find a way to like, say those things and communicate them because I just feel like if I had that information, it would have been much more helpful for me. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd I suppose now do you do you ever plan to bring any of your family members here like your mom? Do you think she would ever move here or I will your mother in law maybe or..', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tI think my parents in law are not too keen because they have something which is called a super visa for Canada coz two of their sons are here. I have no clue what that means. I asked my husband and his brother multiple times, but none of them either knows what that means. But they just say it's a super, super visa. That's a really cool name for a visa. I know. This was a super powered visa.

They're here and she could, you know, I just feel like because she travels so much between Australia, London and here, that I just feel like if she had access to that without needing to apply for all these visas it would be really easy. But I feel like my brother is also more intent on taking her there. So I'm just waiting till I get my PR and I'm able to sponsor somebody. She’ll get more points for her brother being here. He cant sponsor her, I can. So, I'll just I'm just waiting it out to see what the situation is. Yeah, but right now we're a bit like okay, because we know she has a multiple visit visa for the next eight years. So at least that's good. But I think before that gets expired, we’d like to think about it, but not sure at the moment. So, let's see how that works out. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tGreat.

So aspirations would be you know, lets see like, getting a house, like being ownership would be…That's very high for me. Family, but that's a big maybe for me.

We have a kitten now. His name is Pause the PAUSE coz he doesn’t stop..he keeps moving. So, he feels like a son. He really already does. It's just crazy how that happens. I never thought I would be like a pet as a child but he does feel like a child and He's very childlike. Yeah. And low maintenance child. So I think for now, he's keeping us happy. Yeah, I do think I would like to like, find a job. Only because I think what I have, because I'm just so used to doing so many things. I feel like when I have a job in addition to what I'm doing, it just helps me. The more things I have, the more focused I become. And like you can see I'm sleep deprived right now, but it makes me it just gets my juices flowing, or else I can keep sleeping. I'm somebody who can who has slept for more than 24 hours straight. It's like I was sleep deprived. I was working like crazy. So I went to London on my spring break to be my brother. And he arrived at 7am. He took me for breakfast, went to work. I went to sleep at 10am at 3pm I'm getting like a message from him saying, Are you okay? What's wrong with you? Like, I just fell asleep. He's like, yeah, it's 3pm The next day, the next day, my God, wow. I was like, Oh my god, I have so much work to do. But I needed that sleep. I'm a nocturnal person just yeah, I'm a very productive at night. Oh that's great so that's why I stay up like three or four and I'm getting a lot of stuff done but also my sleep is less like four hours of sleep and I am good. I can also break it into two and two. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tI’m interested in what you generally feel about your map.', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tI'm not too sure if this is actually really reflective of all the things I have actually paid for. Okay, you know, and I think that's an important part because these things are expensive. It's not like they're not expensive. Yeah, you know, just the fees itself is very expensive for the paperwork. But like, I feel like so for me, something that I like about myself is that my education, my entire education, which is 18 years or so, has almost except for two years, it has all been free. So I think that is not like something which other people get. And good education especially right, like I went to an Ivy League school. Yeah, a private school like that. It's, it's so coming out of that debt free, you know. So, the only two years I paid for was two out of four years on my undergrad when I was not on scholarship. So, but I feel like if you don't have all of that education, you would pay much more for it. In all the things that I have done, and a lot of my trips have been paid for. Of the 30 countries I've visited, I didn't pay for those airfares. Most of them were paid visits, either through my work, or through my school or something else. So, because you're educated, you know how to get things. You know what I mean? Like if you want something but you don't have the money at that time, but you have a very big asset, which is education and awareness. And you find somebody who's gonna pay you to do that. I really wanted to go back to Botswana. After like 20 years, having left it as a child. And I went to Penn, I saw the Penn as a Penn and Botswana partnership. I applied for the summer internship and I could have checked all the countries in the world on that actually, and I only checked Botswana and I said, this is the only one I want to go to. If not, I'm going to stay back and I had two internship offers in Philly and I said I'd stay back and I do that. And then they contacted me and said your waitlisted, not shortlisted. Would you like to be waitlisted? I said to myself, hmm waitlisted means no, but I said, I'll take that chance. And, and that's what happened. Somebody jumped out and I made it, you know, I went. So, my 3 months over there were paid for it. You know, so what I'm just trying to say is somebody else would have to pay much more, even if I paid for those visas in many cases. I didn't. even pay for the visas. It was coming from somewhere else. So, I'm just saying that this cost is not reflective of more than average people. This is like an outlier in terms of cost. My brother in law he has, I don't know if this will help you in any way. But he's working on internet for all access, like his mission is to make the entire world have free access to internet, based in San Francisco, and he went to the US on the “genius visa” was the genius visa. It's given to Absolutely exceptional people is a very few brother in law as in your brother in law, my husband's sister's husband, husband, sister's husband, okay. So he, he is he actually is a genius and he was he works with all the start-ups and everything inbox on as well. And so kind of uses like he's our age, but he is a phenomenally inspirational person. That's amazing. So that is his goal. And this this awareness is something that he brought to me that a lot of people, a lot of things I do is only because I have access to internet Yeah, just not having access to them, but also knowing how to use it. Absolutely. So that is an absolute privilege…that's why I just wanted to like give that disclaimer at some point that of the GRE, I took the GRE four times. How many times did I pay for it out of pocket, two times? The only trip I paid for, for the first time in my life was my own Umrah trip in 2009. Before that, I'd been to the US to Nepal to like, other Australia, all these other countries that I'd gone to. They're all paid for by somebody else.

So I choose Canada before I would like to go to America, New Zealand, Australia, but I can't work with my French Diploma. I have to go back to school and to play a lot. So Canada, it was easier. So, I chose Canada. I can just come and work with my French Diploma. I am an Osteopath. There is some more and more French Osteopaths in Canada because it's the place where we can work with our French Diploma. I just have to have an association here from my French diploma, but its like a separate subscription. And I'm just going to work with my French diploma. So it's really good because the French schools are really good for Osteopathy than in Canada. I think, maybe not. Better. I don't. Those are better or not. But it's recognized a lot in France so it's easier for us to come in Canada to be French and to say hey, I'm an Osteopath.\", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo how did you get the job like', '', '', '', 'B:\\treally easy.

And she explained me everything and then she told me we left with my boyfriend in July and we are working in two clinics. So if you want a place, we just have to contact the business and interview with them. And if everything is ok, you have a job. So really easy for me.

Not so far like Canada, Boston, but we leave the house at 18 just for studies so I guess it was difficult for my parents because I was I am the last kid of the family.

But now in September, little by little, I meet some people. I, I meet my neighbours I made some friends, for French people, but it's easier for me.

At the beginning, I would like to go to Australia because I saw all the pictures and photo and I say, Wow, I want to go there. But it was impossible for me, for my for my work. So I think then I did a lot of search on the internet. And there is a website, a French website already good one to a lot of information about the working holiday visa. And then also on the website of immigration, Canadian, immigration, but more on the other side. I just know that I didn't want to go to Montreal and Quebec because there was too much French people and I don't want to be only with French people and then I didn't decide Toronto. I only decided because I have a work and it was easier for me. So whatever the country, if I speak English it doesn't matter for me but Toronto it's a really good city for what my job but there was a lot of stuff to do. It's not so far from America. There is a good airport if I want to travel so it's a good combination. Actually, I work in two clinics, so I decided to live at the middle. But I am at 25 minutes with the subway as a street car so it's it's not so far and I am a junction triangle. And it's on the line too.

I know that I would like to have roommate, to not live alone at the beginning and to make meeting people easier. Yeah. So I discovered co-living. And I also know that I didn't want to buy a lot of furniture for my apartment. So, it was a really good find because everything is new, and I just have to pay for my food, and everything is included in the price for the apartment. So, it was really good for me, but now I meet my roommate, and it's everything is really good. And maybe we are going to change to pay cheaper, because it's a little expensive, but to start, it was the best decision for me. But now that I met my roommate, maybe we are going to change apartments for another one, less expensive and maybe in the same place, but other apartment. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd like in terms of the visa process, how long did it take?', '', '', '', \"B:\\tI make my subscription in December and I got the answer in January.

It's a randomization. I don't know the word in English. So it’s a draw. So there is lots of people and not so many place. Little by little Canada open more places because they want lots of people to come. This is for France. Yes. If I wanted to go to Australia, I just have to pay and go. But for Canada, It's a draw. So sometimes people are waiting for years and never drawing. And I just made my subscription in December and one months after I get it.  So, it was really fast. Lucky draw. So, it's just about chance. It's not about your work that's about your education. So, there is an age it's 35 but You just have to sit and wait you're lucky like me you get it if not you're still waiting. So, I was very lucky. And then after getting my visa we have lots of paper to do like to give information about me, about my family, even my brothers, my job so I have to make medical visits because I have to work with babies and lot of patients so I have to pay expensive for this visits. So, I needed to go to a different province for my visit [medical]. I need to go to Leon for my biometrics, yeah, it was step by step. And I think in April, it was done. I just have to wait for when I want to go, so it was really fast for me. [The draw] Because there was too much people. I think I did in September 19, I did one subscription for Canada. But it's only I think we were around 8000 but its on this day, four place for the last session. So, I did it again in December. And I think if you check now maybe there is still 14,000 people.

Well, I put that because it was really important for me. It's the website where I find all the information for my working holiday visa, Pviste.net. Yeah, it's like working holiday visa but in French. It's like an extension for the people. It's a really good website and it is for all the working holiday visa. There is like Australia, Canada, NZ. Everything is there, it's really good at the lot of partnership to have some prize. For example, if I did Paris to Toronto, I can use air transact and I have one baggage free. Do you know Skyscanner, A lot, I use it a lot. I will put like that but because it means I during this period I checked pvitste. I checked this website. and now I use a lot of Whatsapp to stay in touch with family and friends ofcourse and Facebook but to find your advice and tips and at the beginning for my apartment. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\twas it helpful - Facebook?', '', '', '', \"B:\\tFor my apartment, not really but to find stuff to do to find some tips, of the bank or for insurance or for the phone, Yes.

I was in touch with her during all this period  from here to here okay. After this I get in touch with my first boss and I think the second boss, it was in, I think it was in May maybe April-May. It was not a real interview it's just about talking and to see our work and to see our thinking about my, my work and just to know me more and our work and deal with the clinic and everything. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo I suppose now I will ask you the question again of like how was the word comparing with France to here?', '', '', '', \"B:\\tSo most important problems at its people in Canada are more open minded. In France it's a generic. But in France, for example, you will see each patient only three or four times in a year, but because they are not reimburse a lot. But because in Canada, there is big insurance and I see each patient maybe every two or three weeks, sometimes more. It depends. But I see a lot of patient every two weeks. And at the first time it was very strange for me, because when they say actually, “when should I come back?” I say “oh, come back. Three to Six months”. Like in France I say. And they are like “Oh, okay”. And I saw that were not happy because I think if I say three or six months, they consider that I don't want to be to take care of them. So now, I do like everyone andI just said, “if you want to come back in two or three weeks, it's okay for me”. But for that I have to adapt my practice. I don't do the same. If people come back in two or three weeks, then if they come back in six months, I don't do the same. It's not about techniques, but it's just about how I see my practice now. I adapt myself, for people in Canada. And I think if I go back to France, I have to adapt again for people in France. So it was very different, but I don't prefer France or Canada for that. Its just different I just need to adapt. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSocial connections?', '', '', '', \"B:\\tYeah ofcourse. Okay since the beginning, my best friend because I made 10 years ago and since the beginning to those that I want to work abroad and since the beginning she say, “okay, no problem. You can go and nothings gonna change between us and I've seen we are more close now that Im in Canada, because as a beginning, I saw That okay with the jet lag of six hours. Maybe I'm not gonna be able to write to you every day to answer you every day because of my work because of the jet lag because of my life. And actually, we are all we speak every day with WhatsApp with vocal message. It's easier. And yes, really we are more close now than ever. And, of course my family, and mother. Of course my dad but I don't have the same relationship with him and my brothers.  I have two brothers. So the one who lives in Boston Well, we're more… I am close with my two brothers but it was easier for me to speak with Gayle because he’s in Boston and he also left home. So, I will Gayle first. And he was there “just to tell me it's gonna be okay. You can go Yeah, I can do it. Yeah of course because I was alone. Yeah so it's and, and I'm alone and I'm a girl so it's not difficult I seen it was not a program for me. Of course I think about that because I'm a girl but I feel so much insecurity, here than in France. So, I really feel comfortable now with that. And my brother move with his wife and his daughter, so yes, he moves to Boston but he is not alone. If he needs to support he can just go home and he has support. If I need support I have to call my best friend and it is not the same. Im alone. Of course I met some people here but I will not tell them all my problems and my difficulties. So, \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tso like what are the biggest challenges that you face?', '', '', '', \"B:\\tarriving here to be alone. All the month of August was difficult, because I don't have a lot of patients. So, I didn't work a lot. I stay home and of course I go outside but I go outside because I told myself okay, you have to move and not to stay in. But if I go to the gym, people don't speak because they are in their own routine I did a lot of stuff. I go to the beach, but alone it's not the same. And I have a big apartment and I was alone because my roommate was not there. So yeah, it was to be alone – in every part – work, at home, outside. Now I feel better after one month. I feel better.  I feel safe in Toronto more than France because when I was studying in Lyon, if I were as well, I don't wear skirts, but a short.. just a short. I know that I will have some… I don't know the word.. well I can't wear what I want in Lyon. I always was thinking about oh, what's going people say, because I'm wearing wearing a short or a skirt? Because they are crazy. They are not open minded and if a girl has a short, it's means that she wants for example sex. Lyon is a big city, but it's like…. it will be the same in Paris. There is types of people of course, but in Lyon it was very difficult sometime because I go.. I will were short and I know that I will have some words on the streets and everything. When I have insults of some people, it was from one community, but you don't have that in Toronto. I can wear what I want. I can make up as I want, I can go to city in a bikini if I want, I will not have any insults or remarks. If you do that in France, Oh my God. Do you know scum? Like that community? That's it was very strange because sometimes you go in a place and you will not expect you to have some insults and you do. So, if at my parents home, it's a small city, so it was not all the time, just sometimes. But in big city if you go to some place, you know that you are not so safe. I really feel safe here. So for example, I go to a party for And if I have to take the subway at midnight, I was uncomfortable and I was always check behind me. I have to wear my air pods. But without music just to show that people that I can't listen, but actually I listen if something happened. In Toronto, I just came at midnight Thursday, and I feel really safe. No they don’t. May be they want because maybe they miss me. But especially my mom, because I'm very close to my mom. But if my mom knows that I'm up here and if everything is going well, she will never ask me to come back. I have news for all my family maybe every day because we have a group on WhatsApp and it's really easy now with the technology. So it was not like years ago, but they are coming just to visit me to to see how I live, where I live, where I work, and how is the city just to discover my new life.

And I took this one because a lot of people take this one and it was better for what I suppose visit here and it was 800 euros for two years. And for exam Oh, I also like this one because if I only stay one years, they reimburse me. But if I took another one you pay more expensive and they didn’t reimburse. And you don't take for two years your insurance, when you arrive on Canada, they didn't give you your visa for two years. Only one year. So you have to get for two years.

      "['', '', '', 'Mi:\\tIt was 24, August 2009. And I came up with study permit. My whole point was just to come here and get my education rather than settling here or having an immigration experience. So, I just wanted to focus on the education part.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, and what sort of program did you study?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI took the post-secondary International Business program. So, it was a college program. And at the same time, it was a full-time study. So, during this program, I didn't have a chance to work, even though I had the chance to get the on campus work permit, but because of the timeframe, it was a really intense program. I didn't have a chance to work with doing this one year period.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, so and what were the motivations behind your move? Like what what did you consider in making the decision to move to Canada?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tSo that's a good question actually. Not specifically Canada because I would like to start, I would like to back forward with a bit… a bit regarding the Austria experience because I always wanted to have an experience for the different cultures different kind of atmosphere that I could, I would have access to in this case, to gain more, not just the knowledge, not just the experience but to be part of an interaction, human interaction, because and then I decided to go to Austria which was part of the exchange program that I was in. I was doing my undergrad and political science. So, after that exchange program I felt totally different. My old stereotypes were demolished on my mind, which was amazing.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd this was ? Where did you go? Sorry?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tAustria. So it was the year was 2008. So, the year after, I definitely wanted to have a chance to experience different cultures. So, I knew that European culture was pretty much the same, especially in the Western Europe. So especially on also the education system was the same. And I wanted to try either Australia, as I mentioned to you before or Canada. So, the main motivation was, of course, as I said, to broaden my horizons, for not just the educational aspect, but just to learn different cultures to engage with different kind of atmosphere. And I think education was good tool to get myself into that door. So, but making the decision specifically Canada, that was one of my father's friend that he's Turkish, but he got married with a Canadian. So yes, so he was highly recommending about going to Canada but he was mostly endorsing about immigration processes more easier in Canada, but I was insisting on the fact that my intention is not the immigration at first place compared to other like the majority of people. So, but he was still insisting on Australia is tough on immigration. So, you better just go to Canada. And, but the motivation was for me to go to Australia. I mean, for me to want to go to Australia was climate. Of course, it was nice climate, the landscape. The culture itself, have it looked from Turkey from my perspective, of course, I never been in Australia before. Yeah, so I made a decision of course with some of the endorsements from my friend. And also, the second part was there was an educational consultancy firm that they came to my campus when I was doing my undergrad in Turkey. And they did a seminar regarding the education institutions in Canada. So, that was also a bit tempting for me how to education system is good in Canada, I mean, compared to Turkey specifically, and it was also different… not entirely different, but there was certain differences compared to Europe. So, in this case, I would like to I just want to decide to move forward with Canada so that was the main reason.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, great. Okay. And so this is I'm after your undergrad in Turkey and your ethnic background is Turkish?\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI am Turkish I was born in Turkey and raised in Turkey till 21-year-old. And after 21, I went to Austria, the one without the kangaroos. Yeah, that's the joke actually. So, yes, and 2008 was the year. But also, I have, over there because the international student community was so active, I didn't have a chance to engage with the Austrian culture itself. It was mostly field trips, backpacking and similar things. But other than that, I was mostly melted in the same pot with other international students. So, I think I would say it was a better experience for me because it was an amazing experience in terms of having some friendships from South Korea, from Australia to from US from parts of Europe, from Africa, so it was it was good. I mean, I had some roommates from Ireland and Spain. So, I never had this experience before. And it was teaching me so many things, how to share the common space, how to share different cultures and respect each other in certain terms, even though I wasn't accepting certain things at first place, but it's helped me to absorb and respect them. And then the next stage was to gain some cultural share. So, which was important for me, and then I enjoyed it. I enjoyed that time being and then yes, I decided to take the next step. And that was Canada.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo why not Austria itself? Like why didn't you think of Austria as the did you think of it? Maybe?\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI never thought of it. I taught mostly in Europe, somewhere in Europe. I personally, I like Mediterranean countries because of the climate as well as the culture itself is more welcoming in general, again, it depends on person to person but and also, I knew from my knowledge and as well as some of the Turkish diaspora in Austria and Germany, and I was mostly talking with them day to day basis. So their Austrian experience wasn't that satisfactory in terms of racist behaviour in terms of, in terms of the how the integration process was missing and was not welcoming especially the first generation, the law and second generation and third generation they were partially pushing themselves where I wouldn't want to use ‘pushing’ but they would like to they wanted to try to be part of it. But again, the integration whole in Europe is all different country by country. People were thinking that just because of the common language Germany and Austria have the same kind of integration policy, but I think it's different. I found Germany is more welcoming, especially even though the integration fail. It was accepted by the chancellor. I think it was 2006 that he admitted publicly that integration process failed. But even though the integration process failed, I found during my trips in Germany, and also my classmates that who were from Germany, they were more welcoming, they were more friendly, and they didn't make me feel that I was stranger. But I had, I had two Austrian roommates that we were sharing the same building, but they were not that welcoming. And they were not that friendly. But maybe it's just we can limit for that two people. But in general, even when I was going to the supermarket or when I was going to a bar. It was different. I mean, you could sense that. It was a small town which is called, which is named Kufstein, but it's really closer to the one of the biggest cities in the western side of Austria. It's called Innsbrooke. So it's a 15 minutes difference, as you can imagine the differences in Europe is as I mean distances in Europe is not that huge. And there's a connectivity in terms of the location and the train system. The transportation system is well organized. So yeah, I mean, it was closer also to Munich as well, one of the biggest cities in Germany. So, it was 45 minutes remaining 15 minutes to Innsbrook. So, it was really good in terms of the location… to the Italy border, the Italian border was one and a half hour so it was in the central hub of Europe pretty much.\", '', '', '', 'Mi:\\tyes, my at my schoo…l I mean my time being in Austria was finished in May 2008. That was for one year. So, May 2008 I packed my luggage and I had to come back to Turkey. I had a Diploma ceremony for my undergrad so that was… I was busy with all summer regarding this and then also I planned ahead that I needed I needed to apply for certain programs in Canada and Australia as well. So, I decided mostly the Canada as I explained to you earlier and then application process started. And then, sorry, my application process started in my second term when I was in Austria. And then, I applied for. For the program, I got a approval from the program from graduate college International Business diploma program. So, then that was three, four months period that I applied for visa for Canada. I prepared my documentation. And as you can imagine all that preparation to go to a new country like your health insurance or travel insurance and all that. So, then it was 24th August in 2009, and I travelled to Canada, Dallas for educational purposes. ', '', '', '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, so let's know let's talk about your professional background. What's your\", '', 'professional background? ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tMy professional background, I studied international relations. So, some people think that it's a profession, but an academic field shouldn't be a profession. It's a, it's a different aspect. But in Turkey, the understanding of academics is totally different. They treat the academic programs as a college program, but that's why that's one of the missing parts, my personal opinion that in Turkey, there are some college programs existing but it's not that sufficient or it's not utilize it utilizing it in a good way. That's different topic but to answer your question, yes, I graduated from international relations program, which was in back home in Turkey. But during this summer times, I actually worked in, I wouldn't say work but internships mostly in some firms that was one of them was Hamza bus manufacturing company. I was in their Import Export department because the International Relations graduates in Turkey, they are mostly people, the understanding of this program, when you're working in the field, the field should be in the big companies for corporate environment in their Import/Export department. First of all, they are expecting the fact that your language level I mean, the foreign language, or let's say English, German or Italian, Spanish, whatever that the language that you have. So, they're assuming that you can manoeuvre that process more smoother compared to other administrators. So, we're basically administrator but more and more in a structured format because you have to know the export policy, import policy, and all that. So that was a dimension, but I just wanted to double it also the mandatory on the school that you needed to have that internship during that time frame. So other than that, I didn't have any work experience. So, when I came to Canada, that was my first work experience and that was abroad. So that was the interesting part.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOh, and what was the first work experience? ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tFirst work experience I, I mentioned to you earlier that I didn't have a chance to work that much at the regular college, during my studies. So that was a point that because of the financial difficulties, I had to find a job and I was working at the Indian restaurant. Yes, it was mostly serving position. And my school was typically ending at 4pm - Everyday Monday to Friday.. it's full time college program. So, as you can imagine, it's not like undergrad or something. So, 4-6, I had two hours difference and I was evaluating this time mostly either feeding myself or reading some materials and then going to the restaurant my shift was starting 6. It was ending at 2am. So that was four hours. But not every day though. I would say the hours were between 20 to 25 hours. And sometimes this restaurant was catering to the to the weddings. So, first time, I had a chance to see some Indian weddings, some Pakistani weddings, so that was fun. That was my first, but it wasn't full time. It was part time. And as you can imagine, as a student, the best way to find employment is hospitality - food and beverage. So, then the first full time experience was again hospitality. That was a Tim Hortons. But again, part of that was, so after my graduation, the process is in Canada, you have to apply for postgraduate work permit. I'm not sure they change that or not, I didn't have a chance to analyse the policy how it looks like but so I applied for this postgraduate work permit, but at that time, the ideal way of getting the Canadian permanent residency. So that was the provincial nomination program (PNP). Okay, so here's the thin line. So I wanted to get the Canadian work experience, but I heard from so many people that if you have just solo work permit, to find a job is really hard, or you can find some certain jobs, but that's not going to be as satisfactory because employers - their perspective is typically you have a work permit, there's a validity for it. So, how can we rely on your work for immigration and afterwards but if Canadian government or Immigration Canada wouldn't like you to continue with you in terms of the immigration process, so this kind of jeopardize situation for employers and also jeopardizing the employees as well. So that's why I was in between to apply the PR or not. So then I decided to move forward to be part of this PR  program, because I wanted to get the work experience here and my program itself after I joined the program, I realized that it's, there's a core program that I also joined core program, I forgot to mention, that was not paid. That was an internship as well. So, my goal again, I was still sticking with the same goal or You got your education in a different country, and you got the North American aspect. And then you can add an additional work experience to real life work experience, and then you can go back home. But again, during this time, it was so tough to find a job that compliments my, my fields like international business and international relations as well. Part of it is education. Credentials back home is not recognized by the employers. It's recognized if it's in English in Canada, that's why they accept you for the next step to be as an international student, as obvious. But - employers they typically rely on your Canadian experience either or the Canadian educational experience. So, and also consider the fact that we look at comparing two cities like Toronto or Vancouver, the job opportunities are really rare. Maybe if I would be in in Toronto or Vancouver, maybe chances would be better. But, again, I was in a position that maybe if I could get my permanent residency, then I will get the real Canadian work experience. So I was in Winnipeg. So that makes it more interesting. So during this time period, either like, okay, so you get your PR, and then you can get the ‘real’ job, but you get the PR, the PNP program. It's a bit complicated. I'm not sure if it makes sense yet. Yeah. So the permission moment of programming still continues right now, but I'm not sure how efficient it is. So, it requires that first of all, you get a job letter from a certain employer. That's not necessarily relevant. Doesn't have to be relevant to your background. But any kind of institution any kind of Corporation, Tim Hortons or Starbucks, or a catering company, any kind of field sector …needs to be full-time. So this job letter and and some other documents that you provide to provincial government and the provincial government may or may not they give you a certain credential that okay you're approved for the nominate program and the next step is to apply for the federal program which is the permanent residency.\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tNot Express entry, it’s the PNP. I'm not sure that it was existing at that moment. I don't want to mislead your research, but it's definitely it's definitely worth to take a look at it because we are talking about here 2011 that I applied. Sorry, that's correct. So 2011, it's worth to take a look, if there's express entry in Canada.. So during this time, I was working at Tim Hortons, but also, I was an entry level. So if I was a storefront, they name it. But also it was the suggestion of the employer that you were suggesting me if we will put you on a spot to be in the management. So, your approval from the federal would be more easier. Because you'll look like you're more skilled and it could correlate, or it could it would complement your international business diploma because you're somewhat doing the business management. Yes. So that made sense for me. And it put me in the management program, and I've worked there for entirely three years. And because the process takes took three years, and unfortunately, during this process, you're not, you don't have a chance to change your job. So that was the, that was the process. And even I got some job offers during this time, but, but I couldn't I couldn't change it.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tUm, in terms of moving to Canada, I know that you discussed it, but like, how long did you prepare for it? Like, how did you plan? How long did you plan and think about it? How much time like did you spend doing? ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tSo I think it was… it also overlaps the idea of ‘going abroad’ and moving to Canada. So specifically, just to answer your question about Canada, I would say six to eight months, but going and living abroad. I wasn't sure I will live entirely all my life. But just to have the taste of that. I think that was always on my mind. Since the elementary, because I always thought that the territories are something that we didn't create. So, I wouldn't I didn't want to limit myself in a certain boundary. I knew that there was always more to explore. Yeah, so that was just my way of understanding, as a word citizen or you can name it in a different way. But Yeah, that was this idea was always there but specifically for Canada I would say six to eight months, but it was mostly the mental preparation for - I mean just googling, doing some research about the climate first thing, and some other things the job opportunities, the culture itself, the education system and so on. Whatever you can imagine, I tried to do the research as much as possible and also the fact that I am as I mentioned to you earlier, the educational consultancy firm, there are also somewhat helpful in terms of mapping it out what would be the ideal Canadian experience - that they were not sufficient in sufficient in terms of how to you know how to prepare fully, because they were get imagination was or the their way of endorsing this imagination was mostly a ‘Canadian dream’. Even though that the process of getting your work permit process of getting a PR from the residency that was totally different than whatever they told me and whatever I experienced here because they were generalizing and putting in a different format for every single person, but they didn't mention about the difficulties or they didn't mention about the cons. So they were, they were mostly focusing on just the business part rather than this person is changing his entire life. They're not talking about the career, we're not talking about life here. So unfortunately, I would say a mental preparation was four to six months and between, I would say the next 2, 3 months it was mostly the documents and preparation, documents preparation, some bureaucratic preparation, but the mental preparation was, I would say four to six months, but the entire preparation process was six to eight months. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo move to Toronto?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tNo, that's another part that it's a complicated part. So, I decided to work in the marketing sector. So, I was really interested in the marketing inside the business spectrum, Business School spectrum. So, I decided to look for certain jobs but then I found a media integrated specialist position, which  was focusing on advertisement and marketing. It was an entry level position. And then I gave my previous knowledge to Tim Hortons. I was assistant manager at that time by the way. And they offered me being a store manager, but I certainly didn't want to move forward with hospitality because it was enough in terms of the difficulties and plus, I wanted to try more. I wanted to get a different insight, a different part of the business. And then I got this job at a different company - this is still in Winnipeg. I dis this job almost six months and then I was doing good in the company. But what happened was, there was a family emergency my mom had a stroke and she had the open-heart surgery. So, then I had to move back. And I had to give my notice of emergency. And they kept my job for a while. But after a certain period of time, of course, I totally understand the fact that they couldn't keep my position. And so that was a time that year.. 2015, February, I decided to move back to Turkey, not permanently, not definitely, maybe indefinitely. So, it was a big question mark. It was just an emergency purpose. And I didn't know, I didn't plan the rest. So that was the heartbreaking point in terms of not having the full taste of Canadian experience at that time. I didn't even know what was gonna be my future. Yeah, at that time. So then we've been 2015 February till 2016 October, I had my Turkish experience, I worked in two different jobs. One was the logistics coordinator in an international firm and the other one was, I was the procurement specialist. So I was mostly working in the agricultural company that they were important to exporting and they were actively participating in the tenders of United Nations and I was also working in the tender department as well. So, it was a well-paid job considering the fact that the standard of living in Turkey and some other factors, but after my mom's health was getting better, I offered my family to move entirely to Canada. I didn't want to limit their time being here because I offered them even six months in and out Not because of the policies or procedures, because I knew that, because of their age because of their cultural background, maybe they wouldn't be a good fit. Or maybe they wouldn't have a taste of Canada. Maybe they wouldn't like to be here. So that's why I suggested be with me six months or four months, whatever. And then you can go back to Turkey, we can maybe get a mortgage here or I can settle here because I definitely, I mean, doing this one and a half year in Turkey, I decided to move to Canada entirely, and I want to settle here. That was that, that tangible and concrete way of thinking that I would settle here. So that was a time, because of the economy, part of it, it's the polarized society. I didn’t want to live in a polarized society. I didn't want to live in a society that that people are judgmental about certain things, and I'm still not sure if running away or leaving the country is a good choice? As an individual, maybe it's a good choice. But if you're thinking more of a, because I love my country, I think that individuals can create certain environment that it would definitely impact your campaigns. But sticking with the subject, yes, that was a time that I decided to move back to Canada and because of the job opportunities, potential job opportunities, I wanted to come to Toronto so year 2016 October, I came to Toronto from Turkey this time \", '', '', '', \"So first I wanted to continue as a procurement executive because I wanted to see that there's any way of working in that field and plus my, even though I was working in a domestic company in Turkey, but our operational spectrum was International. So, I was hoping the fact that maybe I would get somehow, I would get some opportunity in my field as a procurement executive. But unfortunately, my application process was really heavy. Even when I was applying to certain job boards, like indeed… they were reviewing my resume, but they weren't responding. Because I know the fact that whoever I went to and ask, even the professional HR specialists, they were saying that yes, you have a rich background, we can definitely take advantage of it. But at the same time, you don't have a specific procurement executive experience in Canada. So that's the roadblock. And then I decided to change my way because I needed the financial funds. I started to work, which is entirely different field, as a construction worker. I worked in construction for six months. I needed just cash to get to the next level. And I was offered by my employer that would you like to be an installer and the money is really is really good. It's a lucrative business. You need to work with your hands but at the same time with pays off. I said, my goal driven, I'm a goal driven person, but not the money driven person. Money is a tool should stay as a tool. But there should be more than that so I said no. And meanwhile, I was looking for some job opportunities. And I took an opportunity of being an account executive in a software as a service SaaS company. So, we were building platforms like coding platforms, yeah, JavaScript and then some other programming languages that we were using. So, it was fun because I was dealing with the schools directly. I was managing the account and as well as I had the program coordinator that she was helping me out, how to coordinate after the sales process. And I learned a lot I learned the structure of not the post secondary or for the university level institutions, but high schools, primary schools and JK to 12. I had a chance to having an experience of the structure is, so it was it was eye-opening. And then I decided to work for, because I needed the money because my initial goal together to get my master's degree in something that, what I am pursuing right now, immigration, settlement, similar approaches, which would be ideally multidisciplinary. And in this case, I can take my international relations, political science background and I would enrich it with the different aspects such as sociology or anthropology, which as you know, it's not enriched in international relations program. There are some courses but the courses are mostly just intro to Sociology and intro to anthropology or so on. So that's why I needed some funds and I got a good offer from a financial institution that as a credit counsellor. So it was also helpful for you to understand what the society's is going through right now in terms of debt. Debt is one of the biggest thing and in Canada, I think the overall lean on the word worldwide, right? So I worked there for for two years, and I saved my money for my tuition and luckily, I got the scholarship as well and I put this money on the side. So, in this case that I don't I didn't need to hustle that much and work doing my studies. So right now, I'm not working. But if you're asking me in general what I graduated from, did it entirely compliment my experiences? I don't think so. Because of the circumstances because of the the job availability itself, and because of also the other the reason I think personally about I experienced is the need to make money, we need to survive. So that pushes you in certain fields that maybe you're not going to be engaging. Maybe you'll know that first place when you read the job description, but at the end of the day, you have to bring the food on the table. So that that was the main reason that why I kind of switched from one sector to another sector, but it was all complimenting the business, which I took my business management, administrative skills to jobs, and sales. I think sales is a different ballgame. It's you can either learn, and it's not something that you can entirely learn. You should have some sort of sales skills in you, but at the same time, you can enrich it. So, it was helpful, but at the same time, I've mostly enjoyed my role when I was not selling the educational coding platform, but I was actually giving some presenting my consultation, like counselling sessions to the people that who are in that. So, to see that how people are desperate, lack of educational background for lack of skills that there is a lack of financial literacy too, which is not getting taught in the primary school or high school. So, it was an eye opener. It was a it is a life experience rather than that work experience.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tYeah. So I mean, I think you've answered a lot of this question already. Okay, about about your skills or how do your skills fit in the skilled migration program.\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tSure, that's a good question. I think I have Okay, this is a I want to start from this story… When I was seven, eight years old. I saw footage on the TV. That that was. That was a topic that some anchor-man they were discussing about what's happening in Bosnia war. So, I was seeing a truck that it was saying UN - the United Nations. I didn't know what it stands for. So, I was asking my parents, they didn't speak English, of course, they didn't know. And they figured out that they probably bring some food. And that says Un in Turkish Un, it's a flower. Yeah. So they kind of correlated to that. I said Wow, that's nice. What are they doing? They said ‘Oh, they're helping people that were actually suffering from war. So then I started with dig deep about UNICEF. What they are doing, I didn't have any knowledge now reach like 10-11 years old. I told my parents that I want to work for UNICEF. I want to help children, I want to, I want to be part of the community that whoever is suffering from war from certain difficulties. I want to be helpful because if I'm not going to be helpful, what is the purpose of my entity in this world, my existence in this world, that's a different way. We can discuss later What is the purpose of being present in this world. That's a different topic, but I wanted this and funny enough, I chose international relations and then I was more involved in certain cases, theories, how it was helpful, or it wasn't helpful to interpret certain situations. And then I found myself in this job, In business kind of field, which I don't like because there's no human touch, in my opinion, I think. You can, you can actually covered it, or spice it up with a more humane touch. It is totally up to you. We don't need to, I don't need to put it as an excuse. But I think how I can bring my economic experience and my undergrad experience with the business. First of all, I have a, I have a theory I have the idea of major research paper. So, which I'm thinking about how the business class immigrants, they switch from business class to different streams. Either being an entrepreneur in the entrepreneurship program in Canada, or they go different streamlines because they don't have the channel that they can actually continue in that channel. And actually apply their, their experiences, right? So, I'm thinking about doing a research about their experiences, their difficulties, specific before that was, and also what are the challenges and how to overcome it. That was my idea. But once I'm getting into more and the program, I'm seeing and getting influenced by different kinds of ideas, ideas that are right now, so I might not stick with that idea in terms of my major research paper, but just to answer your question more clear. I think with my, with my business skills, I will I wouldn't just name it just administrative and also some marketing skills, but you can just put a bit from here and there and kind of make it a big, big impact on your future skills. But again, it's so limitable. It's not that why I mostly feeding myself from my international relations background and my interest in that field, even in the in the class discussions, I'm seeing myself more confident, not because of my business background, but because of my international relations background. So what I want to do with this field, unfortunately, I can put my business skills, mostly maybe into the presentations because I learned a lot in the program, or my, my dialogue skills or maybe administrative format, when I'm preparing or writing a paper because in the undergrad level, you have some short term limits that you can go beyond, but International Business program it gave me an understanding….I was involved in so many different marketing research projects. So that gave me an understanding of how to do research. How you can excel to a point that you can be successful in your future endeavours. So I think that could be helpful in that sense. But compared to my undergrad and business, post-secondary degree, the book will be helpful but in different ways, it's hard to tell how it's going to help me. It is more hybrid. That's, that's good way of explaining that. So, but in future, I would like to work in an NGO, or I would like to stay in academics, if that will be able to position, if there will be any sort of day. I know, it's really challenging, and it demands so much from an individual. I would love to do that either stay in academics or working for an NGO. In this case. I don't want to actually be in specifically Canadian settlements, sector. I don't want to just file the papers and just check the policies. I think that I, I can do more. The more is? It's a good question. It is it is really. I mean, I think certain things, for example, helping someone's paperwork in the settlement sector, or trying to figure out what's the what's missing policy in here, or what kind of policies we can implement in this case? That's totally valuable. I understand. But yeah, I'm not trying to degrade the value of it. I totally respect that. But at the same time, if I can stay in academics, I can try to see what are the missing parts in the policies\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo do you see any missing parts in policy now?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tNow … temporary foreign workers. Yeah, it's a big time. I mean, I was reading an article referring. She She has a Filipino background. And she was focusing on the temporary foreign worker program and how Filipino migrants actually suffered from it. She had a focus group and everything. So, first of all, it's good to start this four years in, and four years out policy. It was it was totally endorsing the fact that there's a Canadian dream, come here, work for four years, but at the same time, that the officials they were doing numerous trips, from Alberta, Saskatchewan from different provinces, Manitoba as well, that they didn't actually fully explain in the thesis. That's what it says. They didn't fully explain what the pros and cons are, they were mostly talking about pros like a salesperson. I mean, we need to explain that first. So four years in four years out policy is once you are accepted as temporary foreign worker. So, the policy was, I'm not sure if it still continues the same way. I think government, Immigration Canada was trying to do some adjustments or they were discussing about that, I'm not sure if it's an act right now or if it's a policy change on the table. But once you're in the four years, you allowed to work 4 years and after your for your duration is expire, then you have to leave the country. That's what the program says, but what actually this program led these workers because they created an environment here they created a belonging here. So they want to find a way to apply for for permanent residency. So, at that time PNP program was a good way of finding that channel. Mostly It started with the seasonal workers. So speaking of skilled classification, yeah. That definitely is related with this temporary foreign workers. So, they are typically mostly the temporary foreign workers, they were low skilled. And most of them, they wanted to stay in Canada. So, they either went for PNP, or they were looking for a sponsorship. But the sponsorship as you can imagine, directly from an employer, it was so rare. But mostly it was the PNP programs that they were finding a way to get their permanent residency.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo, sort of a Alright, so let's also talk about your family. So you losing your family and what was their role in your migration?\", '', \"Mi:\\tSure. So my parents are still alive and Scott, and I have an older sister. So she is 16 years older than me. So I'm 33 years old now. So she's almost 50 I guess, 48. She had no influence or no endorsement in my immigration, migration process. But mostly, my father was a pro. My mom was against.. She was looking at the things more in a sentimental way. And I totally feel for her. And it is a tough decision to leave the country, to leave your family. But my father, he was looking at things more pragmatic way, because he saw that in me that this is what I wanted to be and I would be unhappy to live in the country, live in Turkey. Because of so many reasons, as I explained to you the polarized way of society and the economic situation, yes, I would probably. I'm just imagining myself what would happen if I wouldnt come to Canada Do you think that would be a good way of explaining? I will probably get married in my early 20s. And I would have children right now because of the societal pressure, time pressure, family pressure? It is still there. When we are skyping, they still endorsing the idea of like, when are you getting a married? When are we going to have the children on our hands?, and I'm just saying that I have goals once I finish these goals, and then when they accomplished then my first of all, is not going to just get married -  to find the right person. Marriage is just a paper. The system certificate, interestingly a certificate so accomplishing something of some sort. They do they certify you. So I just don't understand this notion. I never understood. So they are more conservative in terms of the traditional way of living, or being an individual. But I'm not entirely thinking the opposite, though. But most of the things that we don't agree, but I think, in family if you find the right way of putting the dialogue, I think they're going to understand you don't need to fight they don't need to. You need to just empathise yourself. Empathy is the key. So then that works. They don't understand me sometimes. I didn't understand them, but I'm trying and then they started to try my position. So, once I'm explaining what I'm going through and what I went through as I explained everything all the immigration process. Now they value it, and they justify it, my situation that why I'm not rushing, or quitting a job. Yeah. But yes, mostly father was abroad during this immigration process. Mom was against and and the sister was neutral.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAlright, so we can now I think move to the mapping. So, in your case, I think I want to I want to know about all of the visas that you went on in your study abroad, work abroad. experiences. So mostly, that would be for Austria and Canada. ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tCan I map it out in terms of the emotions as well?  Can I draw two tables which was Austria and Canada? Okay, let's put this…So the first one I'm putting as figure one, which is going to be the Austria visa process because there was only one visa, so there's no need to explain other which is simple. Figure two is going to be a little bit complicated. I would like to start with Austrian one because the experience was. So, I think in every single, I mean mostly the westernized countries, their requirements are so detailed. So, I would say this is I would say, stress level. The most two things that I would name is during these visa processes, one is the stress level in terms of emotion. And one is that the work that you put, so I would say the efforts/time. It's gonna go the same way I guess okay so the stress level was not too much because it was educational purpose. I knew that it was going to end really, really soon but the effort and time, European Schengen visa is really demanding, but the stress level Let's just say one to 10 – I would put 4. Stress 4, effort 9. So again 1-10. I would just kinda put here in detail - Study permit. Okay in this case let's put it this way. So Schengen visa process, let's say study permit. So study permit was again one to 10 I would say, because, okay, this is kind of different. The stress level was a little bit less again. I would put 2. OK, because, so the paperwork process for Austria was handled by myself, but the paperwork process in Canada, was handled by that consultancy agency. So, and they're actually they helped me out a lot with that, of course I paid to him. So that's why I knew that they guaranteed the approval is going to be there, you're I mean, you're eligible for so many things, so everything will be fine. So that's why the stress level was not that much, and effort was not that much. So, I would put 4 and 2. Just gathering the documents was a bit tough. \", '', '', '', \"But the PR and immigration is different. So I'm going to draw two figures. One is gonna be the provincial Nominee Program. The other one will be PR process and the last one will be the citizenship application so there will be three graphs. sorry I just couldn't organize on my mind. So this figure, figure 2a, figure 2b, and figure 2c. I mean, it might not be the right category, but I'm just trying to kind of sub categorize. Okay, so let's start with the figure a. which will be the regular work permit/pep. So, again, one to 10 scale. This was stressful. This was this was I would say 8 because the program wasn't explained enough. Even though there were some provincial, like Manitoba start up. Yeah. I'm not sure if you heard of them. They're actually a non-profit organization funded by government. They're explaining. They're providing some sort of consultancy to the people that who are going through this process. So the people over there, the agents over there, they were so helpful. It was good. I mean, I have to justify this of course… but but in general still there were so many unknowns. So, I would say the stress level for the PNP program because it's just the first step, but you don't know what's going to happen afterwards. And the effort and time, I think this will kind of never change because effort and time exceptt this part. This part I'm gonna explain to you the citizenship part, it will always be the same. I would say let's say 9. So this was because there was more document requirements and job another, job offer letter from the employer and explaining this process to the employer. They were even though they were familiar, they were a bit hesitant about certain things, and you had to be nice with them. So other part is you need some documents from Turkey, the official documents and you cannot be scanned. So, you need origin documents. And plus, you need to provide certain documents in different categories. So that was a bunch of different combinations. So, effort and time, and yeah, it was 9. So, the second one, I mean, as a lot of subcategories. I can talk about the PR, which is not the main goal, but the main goal is this, but this is the segue as you know. So we're going to use a different color. So, one to 10 scale again. Yeah, stress level we categorize we don't change the category. I had some some documents already get prepped before, you you would use some documents that are already in the database in this process. You don't need to get everything from scratch but at the same time, the form itself, the application form itself is so detailed compared to the PNP program, or the work permit. So I would say, effort and time goes hand in hand. But in terms of not to gather the documents that much, but to be more cautious about how to fill out the form. Again, I needed some sort of support and I got that support from Manitoba start-up program. Okay. That was helpful in terms of their guidance. They didn't feel the forum behalf of me, but they gave me certain guidance. So I would say interesting way, maybe seven, for for the effort of time, but the stress level was, was more I would say… I don't want to say 10 because it's not a life and death situation. I always knew that I had another option. Worst case scenario, I would go back home. I would find different ways. Different ways mean… just want to open that. People think about different ways as shortcut fails, like getting married with someone or different kinds of opportunities. But I had that opportunity in my previous relationship that she offered me straight – you dont need to go through this process. I refuse. I refuse it because I don't want to rely on someone's bill to you know, I don't want to jeopardize the situation. What if you wouldn't get along at certain periods?\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tHow long will you meet with this person?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tShe offered like I was overall three and a half years, almost four years. But she offered me in the middle of this time frame. I mean, two years. When we were two years together, she offered me she said, You don't need to go through this process. You can just handle everything more smoothly. But I refuse. I refuse that. Again, this is this is really complicated because if you really don't feel that this is the right thing, because some people, they just rely on this, and I didn't want to do that. It wasn't voluntarily some people just, you know, offer some sort of money or internal arrangement. They call it fake marriage, but it wasn't fake. It was real that at the end proves that we are not together anymore. So, I was right. I was right. Okay, so seven, stress level was nine. And the last one will be the citizenship. Yes, I already applied for my citizenship. I pass the knowledge test, I'm just expecting the oath, the ceremony. So, the time that I pass the knowledge test, it was 29 April this year. So, they literally talked to me about the timeframe between six to six months, six months to One year. So, we will see how that goes. It's already five months past, I have no rush. I think the stress level is really low because after this process, it lowers. Its smooth. So, I would say to and the effort again, I got, I was busy at that time, and I got some help from an immigration agency that they prepare those documents. So, I would say after that time, maybe 4, so two and four.\", '', '', '', \"I guess I already passed the certain stages. And according to my immigration consultant, she said that if you pass the knowledge test, and if you provided certain documents and all about, it's all about just waiting for them to call you for the oath, and the ceremony, and then you will be officially getting the certificate of citizenship, so it's not 100% because it's not official, but it's on the way.\", '', '', '', \"I lived in Turkey for one and a half years, the certain requirement is, as you might know, after you get your PR For the next five years, you have to be present in the country for at least three years. So, I had to fulfil my gap for the application process to be eligible for citizenship application. So that's the gap. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAll right. Now we're gonna move on to the next question. So commercial services. So in all of these processes, what are the commercial services that you used? You know, things that you paid for.\", '', \"Mi:\\tSo commercial services - so only two of them so the one for Austrian visa - I paid for it, the Schengen visa/ study permit - that all is the same. I paid yeah the agent. Yeah, yeah. So that was paid to a consultancy agent - that they had the firm. The second one was I mostly use it, as shared with you, that was the not for profit, it was funded by government. So I never got into any IELTS or TOEFL process because first of all my back home with the education was 70% English so let's put it this way - so during my application to the college they recognize that I don't need to provide any IELTS in Canada. So I never got any IELTS or any TOEFL. I found the way. So other than that when it came to applying for citizenship they they were asking basically the requirement is but also what complimented my post secondary, that the regular college, because if you have the post-secondary diploma It shows the certain benchmark, and you're not going to get the test English test required.\", '', '', '', \"So visa fees, I paid it by myself for the Canadian citizenship one. But for the Austrian one, it was help from the parents. So yes, it was paid by the people that I have the relationship with. All the fees of course and I paid for it. So the Austrian one was paid for by my family. It was supported by my family but the rest it was paid by my own financial funds. I covered everything. So yes, I’m going to include that one too. The insurance for sure. So, other than that, as you mentioned the translation services - that was a big thing that I paid for. So, I pretty much paid except the citizenship one, I pretty much paid for all those documents the entire process each time. Okay, let's let's be clear. I'm just trying to refresh my memory so not each time. So, only one time for the for the translation services because I had already got documents that I translated. and not for the police clearance because you need to always renew it has to be updated version as you might know. But the rest like let's say, the translation of diploma or certain things. I had it only once and I kept the record of it as a scan version because I knew that the application process was going to be held online. So that's why it was easier. I didn't have to pay each time. But it is kind of complicated because I set the police clearance and the police clearance from Turkey. You don't pay for it. It's a free service. Like everybody has a right to get that documents without any problem. But just because it needs to be updated. So, you have to literally translate it and get that done all the time. So that's why it was the most challenging part. It was all in Turkey. Diploma, criminal record check, what else? - birth certificate, and of course ID, and pretty much it. So for Austria I would say all. For, Canadian citizenship, just because I had already diploma, translation as well as birth certificate and Id, already so I only needed the police certificate. So for the first work permit – it was pretty much everything. By the way, if it might be more that I'm gonna go home and just check it out. I can add more. PR process – so I think, of course CR (criminal record), I already had preparation for from my previous work premise application so that complemented most of it. So, the health insurance for Canadian citizenship, there's no health insurance needed. Work permit – its hard to think. We forgot the study permit – of course this was a consultancy as well, which is the most important. So study permit. I think I have the tendency to forget that maybe that time. Let's put a note here that I said this one okay, let's put it this way all of the translation services were provided by Turkish origin services or companies. \", '', \"Insurance was a Canadian company called CR something. Document translation was provided by Turkish councillor. Why don't the reason that why I need the Turkish origin any documents from originally from Turkey, that translation Part too because since I was living in Winnipeg, they don’t have a consulate there. The consulate is in Toronto so I took advantage of that in my citizenship application. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tTell me about the role of technology in your migration. ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tHeavily heavily… and I know mom praise Steve Jobs,Bill Gates a lot… because the communication tools are there. But apart from that I actually use technology for my research or to seek certain things even in the city - what kind of gigs what kind of events, even during my time being in Canada too so yes. So maybe you can categorize it and…Connection is one thing. You use technology, mostly, heavily right? So, communication. So, this graph is going to be the first one and use of technology category. So, the first one we will do is the communication. So in communication is I would say mostly I was communicating with, of course, friends and family. So I don't have that much connectivity with their relatives so I would just use categorize them. So, one to 10 scale - So mostly friends were four or five. Lets say four. And family was nine.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what kind of media were you using?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tIt was mostly at that time Skype. Skype is the tool. Yeah, we're not talking about right now we're talking about the most used one is Skype, okay? Because there was no tools whatsapp, viber, no smartphones. Smartphones were there, but this is the beginning, he parents were not able to utilize. This we will call research again specifically for gigs, some events, conferences, which is rare and but it happens if it interests me and then… so research. So, I would say let's categorize this on to So, okay. One is as the Google using as a tool and one is the email endorsement. So it's about, let's say platforms. So, which means sometimes there were some common platforms that people were sharing ideas, gigs and all that. And you already subscribed into it, and then you automatically get email subscriptions, and some weekly newsletters. And one is like, just randomly searching. what's what's going on in the city. So, I would say equal measures. I would say 6 and 6. And the reason that I'm saying Six not because of it doesn't represent the interest level of using the technology but also represents that this may be the rest of 4 that we didn't include, it was endorsed by friends or word of mouth. So, I didn't need to use technology haven't had that much because Winnipeg is a small town. I started to use technology more when I was in Toronto. So word of mouth, it really works in terms of like, how you accommodate yourself in the Winnipeg lifestyle. Because mostly the school platform, I don’t remember the name exactly, but it was school graduates or alumni. \", '', \"I think we should include that one as well, to migration purpose. It was mostly the government website. Again, this is the one that you can rely on. Yeah. And also just because I was using the PNP program, they had their own website and plus Manitoba start-up. They’re helping after you know during your time being there like in terms of resume building, job seeking. Typically they tried to help you out of the jobs of how you can integrate after your residency and after your integration process. Settlement support. So they had their own website, they were also sharing some events in terms of job seeking, or there's a job fair that you guys should come over and for. There's a conference, information session about some policy changes. I was happy with their service. I saw definitely a compliment.\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tBefore I forget, I would like to jump to my experience for coming from Turkey to Toronto. When I left Turkey and when I came in 2016 until now, that's what you're wondering know. Okay, so let's put it this way then. So 2016-present - it was the citizenship process so I already had PR. So let's say PR attained in 2013. So, and then two years, I held a PR in Winnipeg. And then in the present, Toronto. 2015 Apr-2016 Oct I was in Turkey. I can just name it as the transition period from Winnipeg – Turkey – Toronto. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAny significant things from social connections to like friends, family community professional network. I mean, you mentioned the Manitoba startup program, but anything else that you want to any significant relationships that you want to add on your map? And I'm also referring to intimate relationships. \", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI can recall that so you read my mind. So, my my ex partner, she was really helpful mentally. And she was born and raised in Canada, but she put so much effort in to understand what I'm going through. She was always there when I had those stressful times. She was trying to give me that comfort zone by activities, by trying to help me to engage with the environment because I guess this emotional connectivity she wanted me to stay there. So, she didn't want me to leave. That's why I've actually made community like, she didn't want me to leave. And also that's why she wanted me to. She offered that getting Let's get married. And let's go through the citizenship process more, more smooth. But because I had the the military service obligation at that time, back in Turkey - I didn't obey that, by the way. So, we didn't need to, we don't need to add it into the map. So I paid 6000 American dollar at that time, and just to waive it. So, in this case, I would be exempt from military service. So that was one question on my mind and plus Winnipeg itself. If I would like to have a Canadian experience, I didn't want to settle in Winnipeg specifically for my entire life. But at that time, she was showing the signals that…the family was there part of her family. And have she had a secure job. And she wanted to. She wanted me to stay. And she was thinking that Winnipeg would be the place to settle. But I wasn't agreeing on that term. And but regardless, she was really helpful I could her. I would name my father that - he was so supportive. And also, I would mean a close friend that became to Canada together. He was… just because he was in the process. He was so helpful, when the times that I was hesitant about if I would actually put my energy to stay in this country, or I would maybe go back. So, he was kinda lifting me up. So that was so helpful. So would name three people and I guess you're asking it to map it out there. Let's use a different model. I would but with all due respect to my father, he was not there with me physically. So physical connectivity is important, I would put first. I can name her. Well there you go. Ex-partner. The second person would be my father even though he was not there physically but mentally he was day to day, sending messages asking me how am I doing it?, if I need something. So he was there. He was there. And, I can name it as best friend. He moved to Saskatchewan. He's actually he wants to bring his, his brother for his master's. So I think I can name some people in terms of personalities, but also Manitoba start-up. There were two agents there. They were so helpful. They were so caring. They were easily empathising with your situation. And I think their psychology background is so strong that personally I'm not sure. That's what my observation is because they will easily empathise, they weren't looking at you as a case or as a client or just a, just a person. They really can do that. You are a person that trying to find a way to robust your situation here without suffering. So, they were definitely helpful. Yeah, they were so explanatory in terms of the process in terms of even the single boxes in the form that… what to write, what not to write, the due dates, they were so cautious before. So hopefully they are in a good position or not even maybe in the same organization. So 2 agents, I would say.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo if if that's done, then we can move on to the next. So let me let me just ask you about the most challenging aspects of your migration journey throughout. So pretty much everything that you've written so far. Okay, let's circle the most challenging or the biggest obstacles that you faced or mark them however you like.\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tSo, of course the work permit and PNP part. This is the first one.  I'm mixing the colors because just to be just a little more visible. This is the second. This is third. This is 4th. This is for because that's the last stage. I had not much doubt about certain things and I wouldn't want to include Austria because that was a different kind of category. So, for this one [work permit] the most challenging one was uncertainty, the Psychological part, whether you will get it or not. So heres the same [PR], I would say, the psychological factor whether you'll be able to obtain this is the PR or your status or not. So, the PNP and as well as the PR process, it is so connected, interconnected. So, it is hard to, to differentiate from one to each other in terms of psychological. You still feel the stress level. Here just basically you’re in a situation that is your fingers are crossed and you’re just waiting. Can I just make a correction? T his is 2011.  So, the process was, I mean, the PR process was not that long, because each province has different responses. If you're in Ontario, at that time, the process took longer. But in promises like my intro by Saskatchewan, I think the number of applicants, one of the main reasons, is more low compared to the Ontario or bigger provinces as BC. But I think it took two years, two and a half years after I applied for PR. I was on work permit and I had to work in the same employer, even though I got some opportunity to explain that to you. So that was the painful part. In daily basis, let's say you have the moments that you really don't think that this job is not a good fit for you and you have an alternative, but you cant evaluate that alternative because of your complicated situation, status situation. So that was really difficult. And this one was just that just the duration because I think lately what I heard the processing times are getting longer and longer. Yeah, even the Canadian citizenship. So I would just say I think that the duration of the process. This one is more more psychological rather than psychological. It's more….it is kind of psychological but it is more of a, because the cultural fit is gonna to be there or not?. So I would say unknown or uncertainty. Sure, cultural connectivity? I don't know if I just put it in the right way, but yes, there's the uncertainty of cultural connectivity. So, Which means will you have a culture shock? Or Is it the right decision? What is expected of me? What kind of difficulties I will face? It is kind of routing to cultural connectivity still. Let's say it my first year in Canada. So that's going to give you an idea. Yeah. So, I'm gonna put it in the behind, okay. First one year. So, again, we're going to rely on our fancy graphs. This is let's say, time. For the sake of me just try to figure it out because I need time and satisfaction? slash engagement. So, of course the first six months, there's a rapid increase because everything is new, you wanna explore everything. You're not getting homesick. From zero all the way up. Even though I was new, the climate was challenging, but everything was new and I'm a person - If I fail or if I just don't let certain things. I'm not a person that I used to blame myself about my choices, but I don't do that anymore. Because you never know without trying. But after six months there’s a dip. You start to feel homesick, criticism on certain things which is comparing traditions. I put criticism here because it might be sometimes rough, especially in my age at that time, It was hard for me - rather than accepting I was criticizing, And it turned to a comparison. Like why! I was criticizing mostly the lifestyle because in Turkey our lifestyle is more laid back. Not into this is a modern capitalist way of melting our lives in. For example, first time in my life I saw a drive through. I had never seen a drive through. Just sit down - you enjoy your meal you have a nice conversation you take you take your time and you actually give the value to the food. Again this is just the the comparison, the personal comparison for the food – the food itself, and the food culture and how do you value the food. And the advantage part of Toronto, which I didn't have the advantage that much in Winnipeg, like, there are tons of different restaurants that represents different cultures, different cuisines. And then questioning, pros and cons of staying. And then it stopped. The reason that it stopped and it's a more stable line, because first of all, you're making a decision. This time, and also it doesn't the decision that you make it is not helping you to increase the satisfaction level but at the same time you're accepting the situation. It's more like an acceptance rather than making plans. So the program itself that the PNP or other programs, it's not a satisfactory and you know the pros and cons pretty much by reading it, by hearing from other people's experiences, how it takes such a long time to invitation and all that. But by accepting the fact that if you really want to stay, and this is the route, take it or leave it. So that's why you somewhat, your plans are becoming more concrete but at the same time, it is helping you to go up or down, it is more like stable. So I think the first year is really important. That's why I just wanted to evaluate this year. And plus, it's easy to remember. That's why I don't want to go further about  second, third etc.. But I think this will be helpful to understand my first year experience.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tI suppose the final set of things that I want to ask you about generally broadly and maybe part of your mouth This is just questions. Have you provided migration advice to anybody? migration? What advice do you provide migration advice to people if they ask you? ', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI do. I do. I had, especially after 2015 coup attempts in Turkey. Turkey is highly polarized. And the young professionals I mean, young professional friends, that which they have skills. I wouldn't want to name it low skilled\\\\high skilled school because that's the comparison what Canada does but I would say skilled. I value all the workers in a different sense. As you can imagine, that's I just done different kinds of jobs within sectors. There's no low skills or high skills. They are just skills. You just have the skills and you can reflect it to certain things. So, my friends were asking about what are the pros and cons of the immigration to Canada? So, my answer was, I kind of wanted to get away from giving a solid answer. I don't want to mislead people. But one thing that I was just sure making them understand the situation and then the process. I said the first thing, it's not easy. It will never be easy in the in the short run, and hopefully things will change in the long run, but and I said, Okay, depending on their age, I was asking them you need to sacrifice certain things and these things are family, these things are the job that you might not integrate your skills very well. And you have to maybe work, you might have to work in different kind of sector, different kind of jobs. And you might have to get used to a different culture, the food itself, not just the food, even the communication level of people. And something that you get used to that back home that maybe it's intimate, maybe that will be offensive to different business. So, you might have to get yourself into certain situations that, it's a huge sacrifice. And you only live once. If you're looking from this perspective, is that worth it? I mean, you have to just ask yourself this question, instead of asking me that, is that worth it? So these are the things these are the tools that I'm giving it to you. If you're asking details, I can provide you the details and I can give you the certain links that you can use search for your research. But yeah, I rather just reflect the question back. These are the things that you should expect if you come here, give or take. So, are you ready? Are you ready to sacrifice?. And then their enthusiasm level is going down and they're like, okay, I better maybe dig deep and take a look at it. And I'll get back to you if I need some sort of advice from you. And they typically don't get back to me. I'm not sure if I do the right thing or wrong thing, but I just want people to understand that this is not something like you’re ready for a backpacking trip. And you should understand that once they come here, they come here with certain burdens, financial burden on their shoulder, maybe they sell their car, their house, it's a big change. So, who am I to actually tell people that, yeah, you should come to Canada, you're going to be wealthy or rich, Canada is waiting for you. No, they need to be aware. So that's why I'm being so cautious when I'm giving them direction. I wouldn't call it giving them direction, I would call them just putting everything on one basket and making sure that the knowledge basket is full and they're picking the one that they need. So, I don't want to give the wrong direction. Because there's no wrong or right direction. It's everybody's own direction. So that's why I'm being really careful. But answering your question. Yes, time to time and they're asking me those questions. For education, it's a different aspect. I definitely endorse the education. I'm just telling them, look either for or learning a new language or if you want to get the post-secondary. If you want to get the post graduate experience, it's worth it. It's worth it. Because of these these reasons, yeah. But if you're just purely about to come to Canada, just for immigrating or settling, it's not easy. It's a long process. So, take the baby steps and think about it. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tokay, and what are your next steps?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tOne thing that I really like to do is when you are so connected with the work environment in Canada and you just have some other priorities to settle and earn, you let go of certain things like traveling, or participating in certain things because it all comes with the certain financial requirements, right?. So, first of all I want to value give the value to it. I want to enjoy what's actually in Canada. That's one part and… but before that I want to finish my, my school. I want to get my degree and I would like to concentrate on how I can fit myself into either academic environment. Or, as I told you working in a meaningful NGO that I can actually put my skills, learn more, gain more, give more. So that's my goal. Specifically, for Canada. Yes, I would like to live in this country. This country is great. I mean, but the experiences are great because we cannot blame either people or culture or physical things. The system has so many missing points. We all agree with it and officials agree with it especially after post 911 they increase securitization and migration regimes, border regimes and everything. It got to a point that stereotyping is so easy, visualization so easy. Unfortunately, as we talked before, taking part in, in in certain environments is not that easy, because there are certain barriers, especially workplaces diversity wise. Yes, yet, compared to other countries Canada is well diverse, but we have to actually fulfil this diversity as we talked before, so that's why I just really want to want to be …want to access certain things that I can fulfil my desires. At the same time I would like to have a good network in here that, which I've already started and I'm building that out which is good to take it to the next level but I cant just commit myself either living in Canada entire my life for going back to Turkey. I cant commit to this because you never know. You never know but I certainly think that there are so many opportunities here that I can take. And in the short run, and between the short and long run, I will definitely see myself I see myself to leave here and take advantage of everything but this is life as as my time being the gap between 2015 and 16. Sometimes things happen and life taught me that. Even though your desire is to be here, sometimes the circumstances put you in that spot. But in normal circumstances, yes, this country can give so much and I can also give so much that this country has got. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tBut what about life goals as well? Like do you want to get married or buy a house?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI think buying a house doesn't make sense, especially this in this. Yes, in this market prices. It doesn't make sense but of course in the future. But again, to to give to sacrifice so much from your life, to make a property meaningful, I think it doesn't make sense to me. I mean, the condition that the mortgage is important. I see some people that they are working for the mortgage for their entire life, but you only be once. How does that make sense? Instead maybe depending on the circumstances maybe buying your land and building my own house that's more meaningful. But again, it depends. So, of course, I would like to get married, again that the marriage meeting that doesn't mean a certificate. Just to get connected with someone forever, because I know some people that they are actually married in paper, but they're not connected. So, living separate lives. I don't want that type of relationship. So, it shouldn't be based on satisfying sexual needs. It should be based on connectivity, chemistry, and you should have your own space at the same time, which means we need to respect each other's space and also share and build something together.\", '', '', '', \"Toronto is not a good place for romance. We can meet so many new people, so many girls. But I think the connectivity is missing? Everybody's excuses is I'm busy. That's one thing. But other than that, I think this is a place that people living life most likely casually. I mean, casual relationships. That's what I mean. So that's why it's easy to meet new people, but it's not easy to provide the sustainability.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how do you meet people?', '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tI used to meet people that were that was at the birthday parties or events. Also, like occasional because I'm really open to talk every single person, it doesn't mean that. You know, you're asking for a date or something. But yeah, definitely, just uh, I don't think that the using the online tool Is this helpful. I tried five years ago, but it wasn't working, the online dating. It's so shallow and because you already… I'm not sure how to… I'm sure there's a sociological pathway behind it. But first of all, you're judging them by physical attributes. That's how you say yes. I think so not so many people reading the profile descriptions of that specific person. And when you meet there's a certain shy border and there's no uniqueness. Because everything is all structured. I think there was a documentary in Netflix about this, this topic. It was actually I'm just trying to remember the name of it. Black Mirror. There was an episode that. So that's a good one. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAlright, cool. So now the final question final. I'm looking at your map. What do you feel?\", '', '', '', \"Mi:\\tThe first feeling? It was it was tiring [laughs]. It was tiring, but I'm proud of myself In that sense that, Okay, I'm not, I'm proud of myself not to accomplish a citizenship process. I’m proud of myself that I gave myself a timeline to reach my goal. My initial goal was to get my Masters in the first place before I came here, because a lot I would make it may be shorter, but maybe it was meant to be this way. I believe in certain holistic things. And so I'm proud of myself that I thought about failing, I mean, if I was failing or not, or I thought about if I should change my path or anything, but I'm happy where I am right now. That's why I'm proud of myself. That maybe I had to go through all this. It made me stronger. Was that worth it? I think it's worth it in a sense that I am able to open the door to reach my ultimate goal regarding my educational view, right. But at the same time, it has taken certain things from me. The couple things that I want to mention, first thing that the family connection as much as I'm connected with, with my family using the communication tools, the technology and all that. But still, I didn't have a chance to witness, they're getting older, that process. I wanted to be with them. But at the same time some part says that this is life and we need to find your own path. Other thing is what I noticed, I think it's by this age and also what you read through to me, I was giving more meaning to the friendships to relationships, but it got diminished. I think during this process, I also seen some personal disappointments too when I was relying on certain people and certain friendships and relationships. That and then that's why also I just certainly focused on education. And to proceed in that field. So yeah, I think some part is missing, definitely I'm not the same person in the first time, when I first moved to Austria. Of course, age plays a role and the enthusiasm in certain things is different. I put more logic into things rather than intuition. It kind of makes me happy because the failure stage is not there. I know that how not to fail certain things which is which kind of makes me kind of happy. But at the same time, what makes us human also… that intuition that's, that's humane touch. But in Toronto, referring to your previous question about dating, or meeting new people. It's meeting people is not a problem, but having that meaningful conversation, It's a problem. I'm not trying to put myself in superior situation or degrade them or finding that put a scale or something. No. But maybe they are in the same situation maybe my, my way of talking to them, my interest levels are not appealing to them, its compatibility. Do you believe that putting up excuses, or is it just an excuse for people to have priorities? If you're really stressed with work, and if you're going to meet people right after your stressful shift, that's not going to be a worthwhile time.M:\\tIt is recording. Let's get started. So when did you first migrate to Canada? \", '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tIn 2018 February. And this is a permanent residency visa. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat were the motivations behind your migration here? Like what were the main factors you considered in making this decision? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tI think the main attraction was that they were giving a permanent residency like I was a US on work visa. To get a green in US for Indian National…according to some timelines, it's gonna take like 150 years. Yeah. So I can explain you why is that but that was the main reason. I would have never got a green card in US. So Canada was giving permanent residency easily so that’s the reason I moved here. So they have a country wide quota. They give green card from a pool of 7% of  the population from a particular country. So because India has a huge population, their dates are like...So, they are still giving green cards to people who applied in 2008-2009 from India, but for other countries like Pakistan, Nepal ,and Sri Lanka, they get it in one to two years. So that’s the flawed system that they have, especially Indian, Chinese and Filipinos are the most affected because of the number of people applying. So they have a cap of 7%.. So 7% of the green cards – they will give to a particular country. So that’s where the challenge is. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo how I mean…What's the difference between US and Canada? I mean, do you feel the difference?\", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tSo there is a difference. In the US, the salaries are much higher, much higher than Canada. It's like less expensive there because of the city that we were living in but generally the taxes are less. So I would say the health care expensive there. But otherwise everything is cheaper compared to Canada. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhere in the US where you?', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tI lived in multiple cities so I studied at Buffalo. Then I lived in Texas for some time. I lived in Indiana, Indianapolis thats like closer to Chicago. Those are the major cities I lived in. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOh, amazing. Well, how long were you in the US for?', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tSo I went there in 2013. So from 2013 – 2018 I lived there.

', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd are you currently working within your professional fields as well? ', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tYes', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how long I mean did you plan on consider your migration prior to move to Canada?', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tSo I would say, like, six months. That’s what it took me for moving to Canada, like I had to do the IELTS exam, then create my express entry profile and submit all the documents. Once I had my profile, it took me 2 and a half months for the final approval. And then I got my PR cards. Then I moved here in Feb 2018 so for the initial six months I was still going to the US for work, like I’d go on Monday and come back on Thursday. Yeah so I was still doing that for like six months but from October last year, I got a full time job in Toronto so im based here. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tRight. And like couldn't I mean, was there other pathways for you apart from getting the green card? I mean, like, could you just continue working?\", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tYeah, I could have continued working there on work visa but there are a lot of restrictions on the work visa. Like, when you're switching from one company to another company, you need to redo the process again. They are increasing their timelines for giving you approval for your work visa. And then like, if your visa is expired, your driving license expires as well so there are a lot of implications that comes when your expires. And then my wife, she did Masters in US as well. Unfortunately her visa was not fit for H1B so she had to quit her job. So she was on a student visa and she was working on her student visa. But she was not from stem background. So she gets only like one attempt at H1B and her visa was not in the lottery. So they have like, I think they allocate 5000 visas, and they’re like 250k people that apply for them, Right? So like one out of to get like 40% john 30% chance that will be picked in the lottery. So it's not skill based. It's actually lottery based. Yeah its luck based. So she did her Masters. But she couldn’t get a work visa. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tBut she could still be on your visa, though. ', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tYeah like she could still be in the US but she could not work. And so that was the main driving factor because I had work visa till like 2022, so I could have stayed and kept living. I had a good job, reasonable, well paying job but then we decided to move to Canada just to feel more stable and secure in our head…And of course, my wife… and she landed a job as a we got here as well. She’s an architect. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd in terms of your family's is just you and your wife and your, \", '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tSo we just had a kid. So yeah my Mom  cameand then my brother, he lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. He did the same thing. He did his masters and now he started working there and I have a younger sister as well. She lives in Delhi. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo what was the sort of family's broader role in your migration like even getting out of India for the first time for example, like were they very supportive of it what it was? \", '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tYeah. They were supportive. So I went out from India for work. So ofcourse, they were not paying anything and I was getting paid to move.  But then when I had to move to US, I had to take student loan.  But because I had worked in Singapore for some time, I had saved up some money for my education.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo was that always the plan that you go to work in Singapore and then study further in the US? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tNo that was not the plan. I was planning to work in India and then study in India and do my MBA in India. But then I got an opportunity to work in Singapore. So I moved there and after moving there, I realized I cannot stay here for long. Like it’s a place where you can stay for one or two years not longer than that. It’s a very small country. There are very limited job opportunities there. Salary wise, It's like, not too much and the work culture as well, Its like, I felt I cannot stay there for long...like I don’t have a long term instinct for staying here.. So what next, so that’s where the US came in. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tNow in terms of here in Canada, do you have any friends family or community here?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tSo I have mu childhood friends who moved from India to Canada. So I have few of those and then I have some distant family, and my wife has her friend circle. So, they helped us in settling here but for decision making not…It's because I mean, we, we did our own research... we didn’t talk to them much. But once we were here, they helped us out. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how long did the initial like this visa process take?', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tFive - Six months. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd finally, in terms of destinations, I suppose that you wouldn't considering Canada, could you go elsewhere?\", '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tCanada was our top priority and that’s because it is closer to the US. So, I had that in mind like if anything didn’t work out in Canada, I could always go to the US since I had my contacts and all. Also when you become a Canadian citizen, you can work in the US on a different kind of visa. So that’s an added point as well. So yes, Canada was on the top for us. I can say it was the only priority. If not Canada, then we would go back to India. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo as a Canadian citizen, you can pretty much go and work there indefinitely, right? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tYeah. So you get something called CN work visa and you get it at the border. So you don't need to worry about the lottery and…So you can get the visa and keep on renewing it. So, it's better compared to the work visa. You’ll never get a green card on that visa but you can stay there and work there indefinitely. And its still a skills-based visa. So you need to have a certain degree and you need to work in a certain profession. Then only, they will give you that visa.  \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo tell me about your skills now I mean like what what is what is the skills that you applied with? How do you consider yourself a skilled migrant? ', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tSo I mainly work in IT consulting. I have like around 10 years of experience. I did my Masters.. that’s management information systems from Buffalo. State University of New York at Buffalo. So I have a Business technical consultant background. So I work both on the business side and on the technical side. So right now im working for a banking client here. So that’s where, I have my skills. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo I suppose my question so I'll ask you the question and then based on the question you can map it out, right? So tell me about all the visa categories that you went through from the point of your initial departure from India to current status. \", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tSo this is Singapore one. And then you also have from here.. the US. So that was from Singapore.. that’s the student visa. And then US work visa. So student visa for like 2 years and then you get the student related work visa which is the H1B. And then you get H1B which is 3 years and then you get a H1B extension that’s again for two years. So you get for six years but if your company files a green card for you and if you are at a certain stage for your green card, you can get it extended for n number of years. So I was in the process. I was in the middle of that process of filing my green card. So, I could have extended it for n number of years. So I would say within Green Card process. So you don't actually get the green card, but because you have crossed a certain stage in your green card process, you can extend your work visa indefinitely. So maybe just say extending it indefinitely. Then I took the permanent residency.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo commercial services that you used in your migration journey from initial stages to even your current status. So I want you to think about between this part so this was work related so work did everything for you. So pretty much all of the processes throughout this process where you spend money?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tSo Singapore I didn't have to spend anything. My company did my work visa. They did my flight tickets and everything as well, initial accommodation as well. So nothing here. So US student visa, I actually hired a consultant to help me out with selecting the universities, doing like a lot of paperwork for different universities. So, I had I hired a consultant. The consultant was based in India, Delhi. They took inputs from me, of course, and then they like based on my GRE score and my TOEFL scores, they advised which universities would be like ambitious for me, which will be like, suitable for my score, which will be like, like, easier to get into. So they divided the list of universities in three categories. And then I like, I applied to a few in the ambitious category, few where I would get in easily and few where theres a 50:50. And I got in between, So GRE is generally like it's maths and English. And TOEFL is just English. Yeah. So GRE is what gets you admission in like science courses and then TOEFL is the one for English. I mean, these are different tests. So I got a decent score in the first attempt in GRE. So I didn't have to take it multiple times. But yes, you can take it multiple times and apply with different schools. And you get your health insurance from the university as well. Yeah. So you need to pay like a little amount and that was discovered by the university. But yeah, like flight tickets from Singapore to US.. I did them and then universities have their application fees as well. I would have applied for like five universities and then I got an admit from like 3 universities and then I had to choose like, one of those 3 universities. A lot of thought went into it, like one thing was return of investment, like how much I how much my tuition fees would be, and what I'm expecting, like, a package once I graduate from there, how easy to get a job. So that was one of the criterias. Like, there was a university, which was really good, but the fees was too high for me. So I didn't accept that invite. So that was like some of the considerations. So tuition fees. I use, like Facebook groups. University had a Facebook group. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd in terms of now, Canadian, PR what was some of the commercial services that', '', 'you have an agent for this one?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tNo, I didn't have an agent. I so this was something called Canada visa forums. So I used those forums to get all my knowledge and information. They were they helpful.\", '', \"We don't need an agent for Canada. So they have a whole process. So first I need to give the IELTS exam and then I had to get my degrees verified from WES – both for me and my wife. So that was the pre, the process before I applied. Once I got selected in the express entry... So, you get a particular NOC code so you apply in a particular code. So probably that's where my skill came into picture. I was able to apply in I think software consulting code or something like that and I also got nomination from Ontario. But I didn't have to use it because I already had submission points. But that's again based on the NOC code that I had applied into. I had like 478 points. So I didn't have to use but Ontario wanted to give space based on your NOC code, so they did give it to me. but that's a longer process. And I had enough points without PNP. So, there was more that I had to spend here. We had to show money, we had to do medicals, \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd this point [US work visa] was your wife with you as well.

So she studied in the US as well and I invested in her study, so that's a whole different process. She came as my dependent. Then she switched to student visa. And then she was applying to apply for US work visa. So I was on h1 and so she came on H4 dependent visa. And then switched to F1 student visa. So F1 and then she again, switched to my H4 because she didn't get the h1B. So after H1, theres something called the OPT visa. So you can work for… so that's like a student work visa. OPT. So if you are from a technology background, you get it for three years. But if you are like an MBA or architect in her case, you get it for one year. So if your course is not part of STEM courses, you get it for one year. Otherwise you get it for three years. So, she got it for one year. That's why she was able to work with us for a year after graduating.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what does this h4 dependent process have? Like you must show some paperwork there too, right? ', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tYeah but that was handled by company. Typically, h1 visa is handled by your company they do all the paperwork. I mean, they of course ask you documents, but then they have their own attorneys and lawyers who take care of submitting and everything. Student visa is you but work visa, your company does everything. They need to file on your behalf.

So you give your GRE, you give your TOEFL. So she had to go through thw whole thing and again applying in multiple universities and then you get an admit. Like I've lived in so many cities, Toronto is where I can say okay, this is such a good diverse city. I really like it actually. It's very, very nice. Like, we were married for like four years in US. But we had a baby only when he moved to Toronto just in last one years because we feel like this is a place where we can settle down. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tReally? Wow, that's interesting. So, what is it about this place that makes you feel that way?\", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tIts so open. Like I’m a Muslim. I was fasting I went to my office.

What is it about…what I'm doing? But here I could be myself and still I would be accepted. I think the diversity aspect. People know here. They have grown up with with diverse people. So, they are open to that. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo we will move on, sorry, to the questions of this forums. And I want to know ask you about generally about technology. So tell me about the role of technology apart from your technology degree…from the initial sort of research stages to current migration status, conducting online research, resources that you used, or what sort of forums that you used social media that you used for any sort of general broad uses of technology as well.', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tOkay, so yeah, I mean, again, for doing research about the US universities, I did a lot of online research. I joined some Facebook groups. So those groups were, like specific to those University. So they were so it was mainly for Indian students. So Indian student organizations would be there in each university. They would interact with the aspiring candidates and help them in making a decision as well. So Indian Student Associations at universities. So they helped in settling as well. Like when you arrive at the airport, someone will come to pick you up and they will help you get a room as well. So I mean you need to pay for it but at least someone is showing up at the airport in a new city, new country at odd hours during the night, and then they give you like initial accommodation for a week. So they will arrange accommodation with another student who would keep you in your in their house for the week until you find your own accommodation. And take you around Walmart and all, help to buy stuff and help get a phone connection, everything so they actually help you during the first week. The expectation is that once you become a senior you will help other students too. So Canada visa forums is where I got most of the information from starting from how to take the IELTS exam, how to do WES degree verification. Luckily like because I did my masters in us I didn't have to get my Indian degree verified otherwise in getting my Indian degree verified would have been a big hassle…sending my documents from India to US. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat about like a regulatory stuff like police checks and stuff? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tOh, yeah. So that was part of post ITA… like when we did our medical. We had to get police check done from India, Singapore and US. So, for my wife India and US. For me, India, Singapore and US. That process was fine for India like we had to write to Chicago to the Indian embassy and we got it in a day.  For Singapore I had to send my fingerprints to Singapore for verification. For US it was a lengthy process... not a lengthy process but it was time consuming …took me three months to get my FBI check from US. So, from Singapore and India, it was quicker but from US it took a lot of time because that's how their process is. So they take you fingerprints and then they give a report saying all clear or something. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo actually, I think I'll try back a little bit. Why not? Why did you have to go and study in the US? Like, why didn't you want to do your masters in India? \", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tSo the thing was, you know, to get in a good MBA college, for example, in India, there's so much competition there. It's difficult to get it. So, getting a university admit for US was much easier than getting a university admit in India, because there's so much competition. They have something called quota system, so that pulls you down as well. If you are not in quota, then you have like limited number of seats that you can applying to in general category, you have like 30-40% of seats that you can apply for and the quota is restricted for minority caste. Its not based on your religion, its based on your caste. So if you belong to a certain caste, like schedule caste, then you get into it and that pulls you down as well because most of the seats in government colleges are reserved, and even jobs and jobs as well for government offices you have that reservation. So, so for general category, you have a limited number of seats, and so much competition like everyone is doing Engineering or something like that, and then everyone wants an MBA. So IIMs are for MBA and IITs are for IT. So to get an admit in the top 30 Universities in India, it's like very difficult and the other thing is the return of investment. Like you spend like a lot of money in India. So those colleges are expensive. They are cheaper compared to US, but they're still like, half the fees as you pay to the US. So you pay that much amount and after that if you get a job, which is a high paying job in India, but still, it's going to take 10 years to pay that load. So you don't want to be stuck in that. In the US, okay, the fees is high but the salary is very good. So you can like pay your student loans, pretty quickly. So like, I paid my student loan in one year. So I got it the student loan from India. Yeah. So there was like 11%, 10% interest. Same for my wife as well. My wife was, it took like two years [to pay off] because hers was like a huge amount. Mine was not that high. Like for my student loan, I just put some money in a fixed deposit. But for my wife because it was like a huge amount, so we did have to like mortgage my house back in India. So, you give you a house papers to the bank. They keep it and then you need to keep paying and once you're done they will give it back. So this was my dad’s property. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo the role of family that you want to maybe put on your map?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tFor for the US as well, you need to show the money. So, yes my dad helped out with that. So you need to show a bank statement that you have tuition amount for one year for the first year. So bank statement and loan amount like loan statement that you will be getting a loan. That’s what becomes your….His bank statement and loan - they are the I'd like to two separate things. So you need to show cash as well. So we had to show a letter saying that he's he would be like, financing my studies. And then he showed his bank statement as well his salary slips as well – everything. Marriage is important…So much in migration, like they were supportive. But like, when I even came to US, I told my dad I'm going to US and quitting my job in Singapore was like, What is what are you gonna do there? I was like, study there. I told him that I got an admit for these universities and he was like okay how much?.. and I said..this much I can afford, and this much, you’ll have to help me out. So for making that decision, it was my decision, but they were supportive of it. Then tell me okay no you cant go or anything like that. Marriage did play a role. Like staying in the US, I was on work visa. My wife was in a different city. I was in a different city. She was studying in a different city which was like, six hours drive. And then she was working in a different city as well and that was a 4 our drive. So I would go on Friday and come back on Monday. So, it did, it became a task. Now were both in Toronto…we both live in the same city, we both work here. It was because of jobs and stuff. Like the city where I was, she wanted to study architecture. There was not many good universities around that area. So, we had to find her a university that was slightly far. And then for work as well. You need to work in an architecture firm which would sponsor your work visa. So they will not many forms in my city who are willing to sponsor the visa. So whatever job she got in a different city, she had to take it because they would have sponsored her work visa. I was working in Indiana. She studied in Kansas and she was working in Missouri. But they are like adjoining states but still different states. And my parents were supportive of that, her parents were supportive of that so that’s where the family came in. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, social connections friends, not just not family anymore but just friends or community, um, even professional networks. Have they played a role? And do you want to put them on the map?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tYes, for example like for this Canada thing, I told Canada visa forums, but then I had few colleagues in my company who are helping me out as well. And then when I told my employer that I got a Canada PR, so they, they were supportive. They like they made me travel from Toronto to Indiana. They paid for the flight, they paid for the accommodation, they paid like $60 for food as well per day. Just so that I can stay in Toronto, and my wife can. So my employer was supportive as well. So it was Deloitte Consulting. But the salaries are not as high as US. So the salary they were offering me here in Toronto was… so it was same as in US numbers. But again, you have that Canada to US conversion, right. So I wasn't very keen about it, so I moved, I joined another company called Accenture consulting. And my company partner who I was working for. He was like you can like travel from Toronto indefinitely. You can keep on working in US and keep on staying in US till whenever you want. But I was like, No, I need to find our local job coz it’s a commute right? Like Monday I need to go to Pearson airport, and then do my immigration because I have a work with US. So every I have an immigration and every Thursday I have an immigration to come back. So like at the airport, I need to get my passport stamped every week. That’s a lot of stamps. And US they ask “Why do you want to go” and all but because they have all your trips recorded. So after a while they are fine. Like they don't ask you anything… they know. I mean, I would know the visa officer as well. They would just stamp it but then still a hassle to go, need to stand in a line to get your passport stamped and everything. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo in terms of your family, are they are they happy with your migration to Canada? Would they like to come here?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tThey're happy actually. So my parents came to US once. They came to Canada just now like few months back. They were helping us out with the kid and all, and they really liked it. They like it in Canada just because of the community. So I currently live in Milton. That's like, yeah, it's like too far from here. But initially when I came here for one year, I was living at Humboldt Park. So that's like very close to downtown. So that's when me and my wife are working here and now she's on mat leave. We needed to buy a house. Toronto is too expensive. So we need to move into the suburbs. The baby is 3 months old. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tI'm going to talk just about broad stuff. aside, so current immigration policies like do you do you keep on top of immigration policies? Are you interested in them?\", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tYes, I am very on top of immigration policies basically with what's happening in the US. I have a lot of friends there who seek my advice on there will be if they want to move to Canada, they seek my advice. And I'm also helping my sister for getting her PR in Canada and my brother as well who is on US work visa. So I'm like, on top of things what's happening in US and Canada. I think the US is biased. So there's a bill that is in senate right now, which is gonna remove the country wide quota for the green cards. If that happens, then an Indian person would get the green card in the same time as someone from any other nationality. But then the catch there is like people from suppose Pakistan – right now, they get green card in 2 years, but after that, if that bill is passed, they will get it in seven years or eight years. It standardizes time so it's bad for them but good for Indian, Chinese and Filipinos. Again, like in US the visa is based on lottery. It should be based on your profile. Like in Canada, they give points to your profile based on your work experience, your education, your age, and all that but in US it is still lottery. I think they were saying that theyre gonna make the green card based on your skills and your profile. But no, right now it is not. It's more of family based. So, if you have your brother is there, you can sponsor your dad for green card. Not like in Canada… like Canada you have like a proper express entry and a proper points-based system. Im in favor of the point the system because it gives an equal opportunity to everyone. Not just because you have your relatives here, you're getting a residency. Someone like me, who didn't have anyone here but still I got it so easily. It was because of this express entry point system. No [other countries considered].. It's just because I was aware of the American lifestyle, North American lifestyle. If I had to go in Australia, I had to start it from zero again, understand how jobs, things work, everything I have to start from scratch. But for moving to Canada it was just like putting my stuff in my car and then crossing the border. I drove. So it was like pretty easy compared to if I had to move to Europe or... Like I have my cousins who studied in France and are living in different cities in Europe. I think life in Canada is easier than what we are facing there because it's English here…language thing… like France and all you need to learn French and then it's difficult to learn at this age. With Canada also, I didn’t consider any other city because this is where you have most jobs. So right now, Im working with financial clients and a lot of times they have their offices in Toronto. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd I suppose now we can go in terms of your migration advice that you're giving your family and friends or do you actually actively helping them with the process? Are you involved in broader sort of forums kind of stuff as well? \", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tNot in forums. But I like, theres a lot of colleagues back in the US who Im helping with their PR stuff. I have friends in India who I'm helping, but not on forums, its like a lot of personal advice rather than giving consultancy. I mean, they already made the call that they want to come to Canada and just helping them out in the process and all and then telling them the pros and cons of coming here because there are a lot of cons as well. Like if you don't get a job, then it's a really expensive to stay. Youll be out of your money like pretty soon. So the job thing is amazing, I mean, once you get a decent paying job, its great. I mean, it took me like two weeks because I had a North American degree and its IT consulting right? For my wife as well actually. She gave an interview when we moved to Toronto and then she got her job. Just if she would have been coming from India, like my sister will be coming from India, it will be a lot tougher. Because you're already in North America. I think that helps. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tI suppose now in terms of sponsoring your family that you are helping your sister. What about your parents?', '', '', '', 'Sh:\\tThey won’t move here. They will stay back. They will come here for vacation but then go back. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd what's your connection to India like and I do want to go there every year?\", '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tI go there every year. Like my wife, she'll be going there in November and stay there for like, three, three months. So yeah, we make a point that we go there every year, sometimes twice in a year as well. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd finally, I suppose I want to talk to you more about like, even looking at the map, what are the biggest sort of obstacles and challenges that you faced throughout your journey throughout? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tI think starting with Singapore, I was out from India for the first time but it's a totally different culture in Singapore. So, getting used to that culture was a culture shock. Like there is a big Indian community there and Singapore is also very nice, very safe and all. There’s like 3 national languages Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. But then, I can say Tamil people are the most racist… racist people I have come across. Like there are a lot of, like, Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils - even my colleagues there who were from there, they would be like, “why are you here”? So that was like issue. South India and North India – theyre like different. Like our common language is English. So that's the thing so that was one thing that I found in Singapore that was bit of a culture shock, or culture gap. Although everything was English so that was helpful but yeah first time out from my country away from my family. It took me some while to settle. I had to ask, like, two people in the train that… will you want to take an apartment with me because it was so expensive that I cannot take an apartment myself. Yeah, so that was for Singapore. Food - getting used to the food there. Now they have a lot of different kind of food but back then….this was in 2010-2012 (2012-2018 was US)… I think the visa issues in US, like I wanted to change my company but I was sticking with them because I didn’t want to get my H1B visa cancelled. It’s a hassle right because it takes four months, five months. Even if the other company takes us till they need to wait five months, and then they will never know whether your visa will be… your transfer will be approved or not. I wanted to move out of Deloitte, but I had to stick with them. Because I was scared of doing the visa process, just a process. It's like so cumbersome.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what did you get a job straight away after you graduated? ', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tThat was very good. IT jobs – it was very easy. My wife is so anti IT as well – I don’t know why. I mean, honestly I have such a boring job. Like my wife, her output is like a building. My output is like a piece of software. I don't know.. how you can quantify it. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tMaybe looking at the map, I suppose. Can you tell me what.. how you feel about it?', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tI mean we can add more stuff to it but it looks good. I mean, I feel good recalling everything. Definitely like I was I'm along the way. And my family's proud of that as well like my dad. He lived in a town in India. And then for his work he moved to Delhi. That's like a bigger city. I grew up in Delhi, but then I moved abroad. So that's like a progress for us. But then when I go back to India, I stay in my hometown so yeah. I feel proud.\", '', '', 'M:\\tSo would you consider migration elsewhere?', '', '', '', '', '', \"Sh:\\tNo I think im done. So, my wife wants to move back to US at some point of time. Just because like you're getting better paying job opportunities there. Like, I might as well because like right now I have a… I have a like, loan on my house for like 20 years. I don't want to wait for 20 years to pay my loan. So, maybe just go to US, work 3-4years, get money and then pay off my house. I mean, salary wise as well and then in your day to day expenditures as well. I mean here the taxes are high, and stuff is cheap there compared to Canada. We have some tax there but like if you buy some items is 7% tax there. In Canada is 13% tax. And then house cost - the city I was living in US, the same house, it would have been one third of the cost that I paid here. That’s the difference. Salaries are high and housing, everything is cheap. So Canada is a place where you want to live a comfortable life, but you won't be saving much. And you want to save, like Salary as well…in US. Like, if you do an MBA from a top 10 University, and suppose Deloitte hires you, the amount of money they've give in US, for the same profile in Canada might be like half of that. If you move to a good city like Chicago, New York City, its good. Chicago has a lot more diversity, NYC has a lot more diversity. Just that in US, it's not very safe and the political environment there is again, I mean as a minority, you will feel certain things. Not so in Canada. At least they won't say it on your face. In US they can say it on your face. Like if you go to a Walmart in the US, and if my wife is in her ethnic wear, she will be little uncomfortable, like a suit.. but here nobody cares. Especially if you are in the smaller cities in the US, they're like, you really feel it.M:\\tSo when did you first move to Canada?\", '', '', '', 'Sa:\\tSo two months ago, so the 19th of August. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tOh, sorry, I should actually say this first is going to be a bunch of basic questions. And then I'll go into the mapping. And I'll tell you when I'm on the right. Perfect. So what were the motivations behind your move?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tIt was basically just for something different. And I'd been living in all the main cities in Ireland for a few years. A lot of my other friends had migrated, you know, and just kind of felt like everyone was getting on to do something new and different. And I kind of felt like it was my turn. So yeah.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay. And what were the factors that you considered so for example, was it just Canada always in your mind? Are you thinking about different countries or?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tYeah, well, I actually was just looking up, I was just googling places to live, you know. That's basically you know, and I hoped that I was going to move to Europe because you know I'm moving on my own so I was like oh, it'd be easier to travel back home and my sister lives in Berlin so she was there in case im tired of being alone. So I looked up places in France mainly and like other places but just nothing kind of really stuck out and then I know it's something that like in the week that I was deciding – I think about three things happened and Montreal came into my head…I think airlink had a direct flight which they promoted online and then, like things just kept popping up it like… it was the only place was kind of like calling me so I was like, its a bit further away and its a bit more expensive to be set but it just kind of was the only one calling out and that’s why I chose it. And like as well because I knew when people have gone Canada before and like although you have to go through the visa process. I mean, once you're there it kind of seems straightforward enough, whereas I know that France is known for its bureaucracy, and like filling out forms and making shit hard for you. So I was kind of like know that kind of put me off as well as a few friends that that had been there on Erasmus, and they were like, I don't know. So yeah, and cheap rent. That was a big thing coming from Dublin because I got so annoyed overpaying for stuff that wasn't good. And now I pay less. I paid for 700 euro for room in Dublin and now I pay less for an entire apartment to myself with bills included so it's Yeah, it's a lot better here…you get a lot more for your money here.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd did you do that sort of comparison between different cities?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tSo Canada so basically so I ruled out Vancouver originally because just I was like look, it's a bit too far away to the side. And because I've been there for I mean, I thought it was gorgeous like, I mean, I like I like if somebody told me to move there, like I would agree, its happening. So because I when I went to visit my friends over there, I was like, this is gorgeous. I can see why people wanna live here, its lovely. But it kind of was also felt like that was their thing they did it so I kind of wanted my own thing and then it was kind of between Montreal and Toronto. But like I said. Toronto seemed nice but it just… it just seemed like a kind of random city to me…there was nothing really pulling me towards it whereas Montreal, the culture of it just it seems I really wanted to try it and I always was like, Look, If I get tired, if it gets too hard with the French in Montreal, I can always move to Toronto. It's not that far like, I flew in from Toronto and I've been connected on flights from there anyway. So yeah, it's the same distance. So I mean, I still have it at the back of my head, I could always go but I don't know. I think I really like it here so. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd home is ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tIreland, in Galway.

It's just a fast food place in Ireland. And it's it's known for…it's a kind of a culty thing.. do you use the word culty? Yeah, it's culty thing. It’s like a big in Dublin for like different Kipper. Like they have like, you know, proper divides with salt and vinegar and stuff whereas supermarkets sell it but they don’t have that kind of stuff…I think they there was some talk of it and bringing one to Australia a few years ago because of so many Irish living in Australia. But I think that fell through but there are actually I actually don't know if there are if it's gone international. But here's so many in Ireland. There's four in our town. Yeah it’s a big thing. Anyway, that's your claim to fame.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tNow tell me a little bit about your professional background. So what type of work do you have been doing and what type of work do you do currently? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tYes. So when I left college, I had absolutely zero idea what to do. So I was working in a cafe I think, just before I finished my degree, so I stayed there for another six months, I think and then I moved to cork and my goal was to get work with like newspapers get some sort of a journalism writing job. So when I moved there Initially, I just wanted to get any sort of job and right away. So I worked in a cafe for a while and I was like, okay, it's fine. I'll do this for a few months and then I'll get my proper job. And then I ended up loving working there. And people there were so nice, it was like a little family so and after a few months of working there, I was made assistant manager. And then I was like, Oh my god, I actually really like this. Maybe I'll open a cafe myself, you know what I mean? I was kind of toying with that idea. And I stayed there for two and a half years, I think. And at the time, I had gotten a freelance job with The Echo paper in Cork. So I was like, writing the odd article for them. And then I also got a recurring job with Roscommon paper closer to back home. And when I got a weekly article, go with him, so I kind of was doing that on the side. So I kind of felt like I was nurturing and whatever writing I wanted to get done. And then towards the end of it, I was moving out of Cork and I was like, Look, I want to get My big girl job now [laughs], so am I said I flew home for a while to try and figure it out. So year. Summer of 2016. Yeah, I moved home for the summer while I was looking for jobs. And then yeah, I got this one in Dublin so it was a sort of editor job for Sci-fi website. So it wasn't so much writing. It was like, just when I read the job spec, I was like, Oh, I can do this. It was literally just like, obviously, correcting grammar and doing mistakes. And I was like, Yeah, no, I'm perfect for this. I literally used to correct everyone's essay in college and like I used to do that for my brother and sister and like, I'm, you know, like, people who are like… known. Like, you got this wrong and like, You spelled this wrong, you know, so people are like, yeah, that's my job. So I did that for three years. And I loved it. It was so good. And I learned loads because I had not actually got any clue on this sci tech stuff. So I kind of thought it'd be a struggle. But then if I could look it up, like the lingo and whatever… And it was good because it was the kind of website that was trying to be accessible to the everyday person. So, it wasn't wired. It wasn't like reading each audience was kind of like, you know, so it was kind of actually good to have me there. Because, you know, they might say something and I'm like, Well, I don't really know what that is. So if I don't know what it is somebody else wont. So yeah, I was kind of trying to make the language more accessible. So that was kind of so you know, and then I didn't know I was between leaving that job and finding something else in Dublin, you know, something along the similar thing. But then I just, I felt like I needed something a bit, a bit more. So, I said, I'd moved here and the aim was to kind of stay in the same field, but I was kind of like, I don't care. So I kind of saw it as a career break. And I'm not here to, you know, it's kind of here for the experience rather than, you know, so I knew as well I'd be narrowing down my options. I don't speak French. So, I was kind of like, nope, I'll go and I figure it out. If its a job in my industry, Great. I just was kind of like Ill do whatever there's to gain experience…but luckily I got something similar now I guess write a bit more so it's been more I guess… so its copywriting so to describe toys for kids, and so like there’s a bit of editing and like doing newsletters and stuff like that. So yeah, it's I think it's perfect because it's similar enough to you know, that kind of an industry but also a bit more… like describing toys for kids..more accurately for the parents because theyre the ones who are going to be buying and but we're launching an app now for kids to play with so like even think of all the everything that goes on behind the scenes, like you know, you need to write the Appstore descriptions, you need to write game instructions, all this kind of stuff that needs to… it is for like three year olds, but also it's kind of like trying to align the language. So I mean, you want to make it fun and accessible, but then again you're not advertising to kids, you’re advertising to their parents.

And the first year you do four subjects, I'm in the second year you drop to three and all the time your specialism is it's meant to be the four and they encourage you to do a placement. And so, I went to London for three months. And then I went to Geneva three months. And the goal was to find some, like I was working in NGOs and just being an intern and yeah, trying to work in like kind of fields you might be interested in. And then I went for one in Geneva because they needed a French speaker and you had to keep up with your French because that was my other subject… and then my final two, they we're in English and French and with the specialism of human rights, but you don't get final grade with your specialisms and so it's a bit weird that it's on the degree title and then you don't really, its not like you're qualified for anything. So and the thing that I love the most in the course was English and I knew when I finished then I was like I probably should’ve taken a year out after my exams and I probably should have done a straight Journalism course…probably would have liked it more, but you don't know that when you’re 18 or whatever.

So it took about January to April, I think just getting all the documents sorted, waiting, like it takes a few weeks each time and all that stuff. And then I got it in April. Yes. And then from April to August was just, like quit my old job and kind of plan the move, looking at flights, looking at jobs You know do everything I could do about it. Yeah. That was basically it.

They all were like, it's grand. Its easy, like you apply, theres obviously like, you can get refused but I didn’t see any reason as to why that might be. I thought it was going to be straightforward enough. So no, I think there's only one that I was considering because I wanted to be open as well. It's an open work permit that I have.

To be honest, I didn't look into too many other options for Europe.

Whereas I think with other places, it's kind of it's not like easily laid out for you. It's kind of like you need to go and find the information yourself. So I didn't really delve too much into it. This was the only one that I found pretty much everything on easily. And yeah it's interesting to me. My brothers in Australia too and he got into trouble because he wanted to apply for permanent residency at some point and then it just seemed pretty like convoluted and like… Whereas this… I mean, a friend of mine was applying as well at the same time, I don’t think theyre going to come in now but I think they just wanted to look at the option and they're like, Oh, can you understand this website. It is so confusing.

I mean, I kind of felt bad leaving initially coz its like Im the kid that’s going now but my brother had just moved from Australia and now ..it was kind of weird timing because the day my flight left was the day he moved into Dublin so I was a bit disappointed with that because I was like, I would have liked to have been in Dublin for a while when you were there. But I kind of was also felt like a cross over, I was like right you can look after the parents now. I think it would have felt bad leaving if all 3 of their kids were not home. But hes home now. Hes living in Dublin. So, and then my sister Yeah, she comes home often. She lives in Berlin and its not that far. And I think she's planning on staying up there another few years.

It's fine, to be honest. And that was a big thing in terms of choosing Montreal. So I was like that, you know, when when people are like, oh, we're immigrating. We're going to Canada or Australia. So theyre like, they have their big Irish group and everything there and then you don't see them for years, and it's a big thing. And I was like, Look, I don't want that. I want to go somewhere that's not that far of a flight, that I am gonna come home often and I do want people to visit me often. So I don't want to do this big “Oh my God I’m never gonna see you again”. I wanna come home for Christmas and have to come home in March again coz a friend of mines getting married. I want them to come out this summer. So it's kind of like I never want it to more than like two or three months without seeing someone. So yeah, that's probably there's probably a big factor in where I chose. Yeah, yeah, they would have stopped me from going like to like super remote, something like Australia. And then just as well, so my brother has been there and when he came home I hadn't seen him for like, 2 years. And I was like, this is very long, like, you know, and because it was so far away, so expensive to go, it really was a deterrent. like, you'd be talking at least two grands for fights. And then like, with here, it depends on when you go… I think my Christmas flight home is going to be expensive but well in general its like $500 return. So I mean, which is quite good. I mean, obviously, you still cant go over board, because it's still an expensive life. But I mean, if you can get there to get directly in like six and a half hours or something, its not that bad. I mean there are places in Europe which are like the same. So its kind of like, so yeah, they’re are a big factor in what way right. And they probably the reason why I probably would have wanted to go to Europe, you know, It would have been easy to come home, but this worked out.. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd your brothers moved back permanently to live with your parents?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tYeah, he's permanent there. No. So well, he might. He said the minute he came home, that he'll go again. I mean, he might choose somewhere else. And he was thinking go to somewhere in Europe again. But hes fine for now. And we'll see..\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd we've talked about visas. So you talked about how long right now in terms of This research and it's about based on skilled migration and people who consider themselves skilled. What are your skills? Like? How do you see the skills in this? What are your skills? And I'm not just talking about professional skills. I'm also talking about other general life skills as well.\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tWell, professionally, it's definitely just anything to do with the writing sphere. Like, I definitely got good experience in my old job. So I think that becomes really like future jobs, like editing like any article. I even was kind of thinking like, maybe I'll get into the book publishing or something along the lines. Yeah, I'm good at basically taking a big pile of crap and trying to turn it into something concise and readable, and it's making it clear. So I think I'm good at that. And then writing. I done know, I started off again now and I mean, when I did articles and stuff before, they were all really like opinion pieces that like my own mind, whatever I thought, and I think now that I'm writing, although its fun, I don't think its like my strongest skill I think. Im good at it but it definitely can be better. I don't think I'm as good at imagination. I think I'm good at writing down what I know, and what I believe. And, and you know, there's that little push. I don't know if I'm definitely the person that will be writing books and all that kind of Yeah. But yeah, they’re my main like, jobs. I don't know what I have in life skills. I think I'm quite independent. Yeah, I mean, obviously, I'm here on my own. So, I'm kind of quite optimistic. I think so kind of, like, if I kind of was like, I knew what might hard to be on my own. And I was, like, comforting to know that it will be that like, the worst that will happen is that I can always go back home. I know, it's gonna it's fine. Like to me, I'm, like, you know, ive been on my own in the past as well. So I think this is a personality thing. So yeah. Yeah, I think, I think probably, it's not like, like if I wasn’t enjoying it, I think I'd be very proactive and Be like okay, well Oh my god, this is awful. I'm just gonna go home, you know what I mean? So like initially coming year, had a bit of, like I was worried about like health things and getting set up with health insurance and stuff like that so I didn't have a scare and I'm kind of like, Oh no, maybe I should just go home, but I'm like no things will get good, its fine. last week got a mouse in my apartment I was like, Well, I'm gonna leave the apartment, Im just gonna go rather than trying to deal with that thing. Yeah, so luckily my landlord is very good at he came around to me tand he sorted it out for me. But I think like I went to go stay in a hotel and I was like, literally like, I cant. I had a bad week last week. I think I was just like, because it was the first time I actually felt truly alone here. I was like okay, there's my stairs.. where I'm going to go when I was like There's no one like I can see…I don't know anyone I can stay with or anything. You know, so when I left the apartment, I need to go to the hotel so it's kind of lonely and a bit like oh now and then I'm kind of thinking of like ‘Oh What am I doing here?’ Maybe I shouldnt be here, you know, the spiral. So, you know, you have that then I was kind of like, No, no, we'll be fine in a few days, we'll get rid of it. You know, trying to, I think go to trying to be like, fine, you feel shit for a while and then get up and move on with it. So, I mean enough to say that if I hate… if I continue to, like, have bad swings here that I’ll leave, like, I'm not gonna worry about like, what people think you know, whatever. But for now I think yeah, this is what I want. I think Yeah, as well as that I think because it was in my house and then it was like, you know, when you come over on your own like, literally have like one base where you call home then you don't you don't have friends ,you don't have your family or whatever. So that's the one place where I could go and then I was like theres a mouse here. I was like, I can't stay here and I’m not comfortable here and then it was like if I’m not comfortable here then I'm not comfortable anywhere in this country so then it was kind of like probably a bit of an overreaction. It was just a mouse. It was fine. But you know it's little things like that they've kind of made me feel.. I hope that it was just one like when my landlord came out and checked, he checked everything like holes and like droppings anywhere. There was nothing. So he's like, I'm fairly sure it's just one mouse and it got caught in the trap and it was the worst night of my life because I had to hear it dying. But it's gone now and I think I haven't noticed that the last few nights. So fingers crossed. Fingers crossed. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tMapping:', '', '', '', \"M:\\tlet's just start with all the processes that you went through. \", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tSo, I'm just gonna say roughly, and I'm going to maybe do a timeline. Yeah. So December is when I started looking at so… like, the first thing I have is just the websites, yes, just going on to like, government, Canada website. So okay, research on that. And then there was a list of documents you needed. So that involves checks say when you go to a doctor, and that was like going to the guards [police] to get approval of stuff. And that's stuff, like CVs, references. Like just basic info look I don't think it was something that nothing was like I'm… probably getting the Garda cert was the hardest because when they send it and they were like two weeks to get this back to us and whatever so that was pretty… of fingerprints as well. Biometrics yeah and then that was everything that I kind of give to them and then just go with it. There was no other real intermediary or like I didn't have to do with any lawyers or any other people. I was basically just doing my own thing, just going through the website. That’s everything they needed before I came. I'm going to say August then. When I came I had to go through customs and then copies of it all the documents that I needed initially of  money in my account, all right, okay and bank details and money so basically they either needed to have certification that you’re going to leave the country like a flight booked back home or your money to prove this you could stay there. They needed, I think it was 1500 dollars for this 1500 – 2000 Canadian dollars. Just make sure that you could pay for somewhere to stay for a while. And then for your flight back home so okay and they needed like full copies of all my IDs like everything like my passport and like all this I am who I am. I think that was everything then then they checked it over and then they gave me a SIN number. I thought that I had to go to like a place for it, like a separate office but they have a place right beside customs that if you want to pay something extra, like they'll process there. That’s what youre going to need to get your work permit. So they gave me the sin number and they gave me the work permit all there. And yes then when I was leaving the airport, I had everything ready that I needed to set up like for a job and the health cards is a big different, in that, you can only get it if you have an established employer, there was some other things in that I didn't have either. So I wasnt eligible for it. But I am eligible for health insurance at work after three months, so I have to sort that in January. I think that’s it. So the health insurance I have is a basic package it's like done, they do it for your visa. Its like a package for travel for like advice and stuff and then for basically health emergency so like if I die or if I have an accident. It doesn't cover like general medical and all that. You have to have a Canadian healthcare or you can pay private for it. So when I came here, I did have to go to a private health clinic. So I had to pay all those fees because I didn't have a health card and because I didn't have health insurance yet at work. So you have to pay all those fees yourself. It was my own like check-up. It was something that I want to get done even before I came over and I didn't have time. So, like doing over here it cost me more money. Yeah, you do have to go to a private clinic. Like that took a while actually trying to figure that. I tried like three numbers being like look Im not from here, like, where do I go? And then I was being directed to somewhere else. But the bottom line is it has to be private, you have to pay up. I think you can try and get like advisor has insurance, but like I think as long as I did, but it's not urgent. It's kind of like that's on you. That's the main thing.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd in terms of like spending money on all of these processes, do you have like a sort of a rough estimate in your mind of how much you spent on?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tOh Money! okay. So initially you have to pay I think its like $200 or 100 and 150 I think to actually apply to get a visa. And the visa itself and then you have to pay an extra I think it's 100 or something like that for biometrics and that's a new thing. I don't think my friends had to do it when they moved over. Yeah, it's definitely the last two years that they made it mandatory.  For all the documents and stuff I don't I think had to pay anything. Oh I had to pay for a new passport. So basically, I wouldn't need it. Basically my passport went up to until April 2021 but as my visa was going to be up till August 2021, even though I'm probably not gonna stay here longer than a year, I had to prove to them that I wasn't going to let my passport run out before my visa. So I had to pay for that. So that was like 80. that was everything for the prep then after that was like Yeah, so the flight out was like 550.. that was a one way so it wasn't hugely cheap for a one way. Airbnb for two weeks while they, you know, like, new clothes, preparing for the winter. Like I packed lightly because I wanted to buy all of my clothes here. And then I came.. initially, like setting up and everything so I don’t think it cost anything to set up, but cost to set up a new phone, internet, and gym just like as an option. Yeah, and then like your rent, because I think you can't take your deposit as rent, they're not supposed to. Some landlords try and get to pay the last months rent… like in Ireland you would always be asked to pay 1 months rent as deposit plus the rent and advance whereas I don't want to do that here. I don’t think its illegal but basically you don't have to pay it but like a lot of landlords will want you to just as a security thing. So because my landlord, I got pretty good vibes from him and like I knew that it was a good person he’s like, Look like, its just to cover ourselves. So I did pay it. I had set it aside to do that because I just assumed I would have to. Like I had done the research, but I kind of knew as well and there was a possibility that I needed to pay a bit extra. So yeah, that was an extra cost. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how did you find the place? Do you like an agent? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tWell, No. Basically I did searches on Kijiji and Craigslist.And then, what else, nothing more than the usual expenses of getting set up somewhere new like getting your travel bags as well. and then yeah. all the new life stuff because the houses aren’t furnished here. So I need to get a bed, and a couch. It was grand because the guy that living here was moving to Alberta. So, he didn't want to bring any of his stuff with him. So, I got a lot of stuff from him and he gave it to me for cheap. So he gave me like his bed, his couch and stuff like that – it was $200 it was great and it was obviously in the apartment, otherwise I would have had to like go out and sort it all myself and that would have been a pain because I'm gonna have to buy like everything. Here I had to buy like cups and saucers and knives and cutlery, like everything so yeah..I mean it was a grand because I mean I think some of them don't even have fridges or they don't have an oven or a microwave or anything like that but they're extra expenses for coming here though.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo were you always going to be looking for a house for yourself like you did not want to share with anybody? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tUm, yeah, like that was the aim. I knew was going to be my so there was like no other opportunity for me to live on my own. Because I couldnt afford to do that in Ireland and we don't even have studios either. Like you might find them if you did a search, like one or two vacant ones. But its not really there…everyone just shares big houses whereas here it was, it was almost the norm to find one bedroom apartments. So I was like and it was a lot cheaper. So even though it's dear by Montreal standards, for me like it's quite cheap so I think it was the only opportunity that I was going to have so I was like I gotta try it. So that's why I did it. I mean, I could have gotten a room for like $200 anywhere and save some money but I kind of wanted my space, and figure out everything so yeah, it could be a lot cheaper to share. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tIs there a difference in income in terms of actual earning compared to Dublin?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tIts slightly less here I think and so what I'm earning now is the same as what I earned in my old job, I thought was gonna be slightly more because they tax more here. So it's not a huge amount. It's about roughly the same. But I'm definitely on a higher wage here than is average. Do you know what I mean. For the job that it is…So I think the wages are known to be slightly less…Yeah, it's cheaper… the cost of living here as well. So while you might get paid more in Dublin, you're gonna pay more for living, So I think it kind of balances out. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tYeah, yeah. So yeah. Cool. All right. Now let's talk about technology. Okay, so the role of technology in your migration. \", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tSo it was all to do with technology, and then moving here, it was finding the apartments online. And yeah, like “moving to Canada” Im just gonna write that website. Yeah, because that was such a great website it gave me all the resources. It was set up by an Irish man and he…. it's just so comprehensive it gives you everything like up when I signed up, they messaged me every two months. They were like, you said, you're moving on the 19th. By this stage you should have this sorted and you know. On the day that I moved, they’re like, congratulations you're on the move. And then they're like, here's a video of seven things you need to do when you get to Canada. So its like first do this and second do this. It was so great. So it's like such a good resource. So like, technology just like trying for like, coming here. And then when I came here and we should be right Montreal blog because it's like a, loads of Instagram accounts that follow it and just to like for tourism, see what was good here and. Oh Facebook groups. Like, you know yourself. And then, what else, searching for the job. Oh, LinkedIn. I got my job through LinkedIn. I've been searching on like Craigslist.. like in Ireland it’s a bit dodgy but here everyone posts jobs on Craigslist and there was like, like babysitting jobs, It was a secret shopper jobs, It was like, massage therapist, but like, yeah, you know, so it was a bit dodgy so I didn't find it that great so I went on linked in. So I got like, three or four calls from places after that. So I would recommend for job search. Like, I mean, I used Linkedin quite a bit in my last job and I was like Why don’t I use Linkedin more. Cant tell, it was like, Facebook in the way that Facebook used to be big and now Linkedin is for work, do you know what I mean? I mean I know it's all about the jobs and like whatever that's what it advertises, but it does actually work.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo these were actually job adverts on LinkedIn or you reached out to employers?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tno no no I was applying. There was a couple people I did reach out to but I didn't hear from them and I kind of know that like cold emailing and calling doesn't always work unless they're actively looking for someone like you. No, I applied to all the jobs and like a lot of them are easy applies as well, you can just click and apply to a lot of them. It's better than sending in a cover letter. Yeah, LinkedIn is great for that. And then at the job I'm in now and all of the toys and stuff are sold and targeted towards Amazon. So a lot of the works involves SEO keyword research. So that's a huge part of technology that I use every day. Oh yeah, Whasapp is key. I don’t use skype because we just use whatsapp now. So that's how I message everyone every day called everyone all the time. That's the my main source of communication for and then, like other social media say like for like us the likes of Instagram and yeah, you know, you know, so I'm gonna be the main source of communication issues. I mean, obviously, I’ve got inyternet set up at the house and everyone needs internet anymore. I got a good data plan joints with the phone. So that was good, because when I did have an internet issue, like I didn’t have internet for 2 weeks in the house. I was using up all the data on the phone and obviously going out and around, so its very important for like Google maps and all.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tGreat. Okay. And how long did it take you to get your job offer you arrived?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tLike three weeks so very lucky. Yeah. So basically, because I got the apartment so so… basically I came over on the 19th and I had the Airbnb for two weeks. So it's like I give myself the whole two weeks to just find the apartments. Obviously it might take longer or I'm not going to think about jobs, because my parents were like, “you don’t have a job yet, you sure you want to go over” and I was like no Im going to find the apartment first, that's key, and then look for a job. So because I found it so early, like I got here on the Monday and found the apartment by the Wednesday, like I got to spend all the rest of the time looking for the job. So cant remember the day and I actually got it but, I was assured that I had it so then I started on the 24th of September. It was an open work permit. So basically, I can work like the HR guys were like, okay, because you're from Ireland, I need to see your visa, I need to see your SIN number I need to see proof of my bank details but I think that was just to pay me. I don't think they need it. So once you get the permit and once its open, I mean, some of them. Obviously, if you came over with another company, and they were like it was a specified or if you're coming over to study, I don't think you can work anywhere. Like you don't mean you have to be a whole separate thing but because mine is very open, I can work for the whole 2 years. So I don't think I can stay here any longer than that. I mean, I think there is the possibility to apply for more time, but I think they brought in something new recently, that you might be able to extend your visa maybe in a year or two but in general unless you find like a specified job and they weren't willing to vouch for you and want you to stay longer..I was just two years ago I think it's fairly recent two years to do whatever you want and then after that leave..Yes, yes, it is. It was a pool. So like when you when you join first they were like applied to join some pool and then they're like welcome, youre in the pool. Now you have to apply to actually do something that's and then you do it and then they’re like, congratulations you did this. Now gives us this document… so was kind of like a little process like that, but it didn't really feel like full steps because I think the way they used to do it before, it was like a lottery and it took a lot of time and I remember my friend doing this, they were so stressed that … it would be like it could be sometime in March or April that we're just going to send you a message and then you can get on the internet and Its first come first serve. And it was like, I remember they were so stressed about it and then they got their thing whereas now I don't know whether the pools wider or its that they don’t have many? I don't think it's as likel at the time…so they're like between now and now… they'll let you know when the pools are open but I don't think it's like ….I think they gather all the first and then they select you from it. So it's not like the first person that gets in will get it. It's kinda like they do choose your from a list but I've never really felt that I was narrowed down or whatever. I think the likelihood of not getting chosen for it would you have to have something that would deter them like say like if your passport was invalid or if like updating the criminal records you cant come gere or like maybe if you've been here before and you're trying to apply again. So it didn’t really feel like it was…no maybe it was… maybe they chose me from list of people but like it didn't really feel like it was hugely selected because it was done so quickly. So It was like, within a day or two it was like here you’re approved for this, not move on to the next stage.. it was like this. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tyes. And the Airbnb accommodation may have you sorted that out before you came? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tYeah, no, that was the only thing that I had sorted  because everything else, like I cant find a job unless I would go in an interview, I can't find an apartment without going and seeing it, I cant set up a bank account until I go into the bank so Airbnb wass the only thing I can do from abroad where I like filter that down through super hosts and…I want to make sure that you know, the people Im staying with are good like that. So it's about like okay, maybe don't stay like, alone with a man, in a weird part of town you know, you know. So that was the only thing I had coming over. But it was really good to have someone coming over knowing that I had somewhere to be. At least it was like I'm going somewhere these people are expecting me to come here so it was kind of helpful.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd organizing like your kind of move, like your travel from the airport to home did', '', 'you do Uber or like things like that? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tSo I knew the directions from the metro. I knew that the place of staying was near a Metro. I was like that’s hand. But I did factor in the fact that I had a massive bag and two other bags with me, and I was just a tourist hanging. And so I had a few homeless people, like, like a few rough looking people come up and kind of chat with me, so then I was like, I'm just gonna take an uber for the rest of the trip. So I would recommend that, like you get to the airport and its straight into town, but I was like, yeah, ubers are much cheaper here so you just get an uber where you're going. Yeah they were great [uber and Airbnb] because it was so much cheaper like 250, for two weeks, two weeks, which is very good. I mean, like, I stayed at a really bad hotel that night when I saw the mouse. And that was like $60 $70 and if you do pay for two weeks of that, that's a lot more expensive but also it was horrible. So I'm like, it was like a one star hotel where it's like, at least at Airbnb, you have insider knowledge, people tell you stuff. Like they told me like, they set up my internet for me, they were really helpful. definitely would recommend that. Can I write this down like a travel section? And so I'm just going to come in here and then it was so Airbnb first. I Had a girl that lived here before. So she was… she went to college with me. She did same courses with me and then then moved here for two years. I remember seeing her pictures in Montreal so she sent me a document of that she sent to the guy who was taking over her job, but it was all like, what you need to know about living in Montreal. So she told me to look at the plateau which was great because I actually messaged her when I came here the first week. I only had 2 house viewings and I didn’t go to the first one because she told me not to because she was like, look, like you can go see it. She was like look its not the best street. Even the place that you live in is nice, your walk home isn’t going to be great. She was like a if youre living on your own, I just wouldnt recommend it. So I ended up just cancelling that and then I was like look I found somewhere else. So, I didn't go to that one. And then I got the viewing for the place that Im living now. And she was like, that is an amazing spot if you can get that in any way, take it. So, it was a huge help having her to be honest, to be honest. I mean, I could have ended up in first place and it could have been fine. But like, having someone who knows is so great. Like I'm from Ireland. I've been to Dublin. Like I know. I know things about living in Ireland. If you don't live in the city itself, if you don't know this exact area, if you don't do this street. I mean, you could take this is a great area, but this particular street isnt nice, you know, it's it's beneficial. Yeah. So having her like her insider knowledge was very valuable. I mean you could maybe find it online but then you would find like posts that were made in 2008. You know like, I don’t know if I could trust this stranger. But I knew this girl. I was like I knew, like, you know, to make sure we have similar ideas and stuff. So I was like, if she was advising it, you know, I, gonna trust her like, so it's Yeah, it was very helpful. I mean, like, you could, I suppose you need to know the area and its hard to like “ask where is good to live” coz everyone has their own opinion. So yeah, that was good. And what else? \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay. Yeah. All right. We were just gonna move. I mean, you actually kind of spoke about this person. Anyway, so I was going to move to social connections. Yeah.

So she was probably the first that I had any kind of, in Montreal. initially I think I messaged her like a year ago I was like thinking move here I'm thinking of moving said lot of places. Would you recommend anything? And she was like yeah move here. So Im gonna say friend from college and then I don't knowlike, now that Ive come here, I mean haven't had a huge… yeah like it was mainly just I talked to like other people that have lived in Canada so like other people… so yeah friend of mine from work she lived in Vancouver so and they were like this little group you have like this like people living outside of Ireland. So yeah,  And I can write the Facebook group here and then that website as well. The move to Canada one, they have forums and stuff if you wanna post any questions or whatever.

Do you actually go on forums and say, or this is what you can do or…?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tI haven’t done that yet because I think when even like the odd questions you pop up in the likes of forum thing I'm like, I haven't done that yet. So, I can't advice but I probabl;y should. I mean, I did a Google review the other day and I never use google reviews and I remember talking to my brother about it and he's big for TripAdvisor. He uses it for everything like here. He came see me in Dublin for like a lunch. And he was like, Oh, I think this place is number one on TripAdvisor. I was like, all right. Like I live here, I know theres a few places that are good. But he was like, but this is on Tripadvisor so hes very like, he's very trusting of it. And then was like, all right, well do you post on it and he was like no and then I was like you should. And then I realized that I should because I use a lot of like I would use the internet live like best place to go for this.. like best bagels in Montreal. I use it a lot. So I probably should. I put like one google review the other day for a restaurants because I went with my friends and it was so cheap, and so nice. And staff are amazing. Like, you know, like I'd be really compelled to do it if I had a really good experience. if I had a bad one.I know I probably should left a bad one for that hotel that night. I was just worried that like the guys would know that it was me. Coz Id just left that day but it was aweful. But then I went on to booking.com and like all the reviews were pretty bad anyway, so so I was like I didn't stay here because it was it was good reviews. I stayed here because it was the cheapest and closest space in my house. Okay. But anyway, um, No, I haven't given any advice, but I If I saw someone like obviously asking questions or like if they were like, Oh, I don't know about this. I mean, somebody told me theyre coming to montreal from Ireland, I would definitely sit down with them for three hours. And I think I'm still learning. Its all new for me. And I'm kind of like, I don't know, like why you asking me it's like, when people come up from the street? And they're like, asking for directions are and so I'm like, I'm trying to even come up with the words to respond to them in French, let alone tell you. Where I don't know where I am. I don't know why people approach me because I clearly look lost. I'm looking at Google Maps and someone's like, do you know where this is? \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd this French, I mean, just the language, sort of play a part in how you navigate', '', \"the city or do you feel that's that's got anything to do with your experience of living here?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tIt has made like, I kind of like it, that I kind of like that theres a different language, and I don't know why. I find it I like the challenge if I like, I don't know, like when I came here first it was a bit of a shock that it was so widespread. And that's funny because Montreal people will tell you yet that the plateau and all these others  places there's so much English speaking there is so much English like 70% English and 30% French. I don't think that I think everyone speaks French so I think it's a bit of a shock when I get here first that, every when you hear in the background is speaking French and there was something nice about it though because it sounds like I'm here somewhere different, different culture, theres something new because like like I mean I can look at a sign and figure it out and like if you gave me a menu I can figure out most of things on it. It's like, it's nice to kind of feel like your brain has been trained to get into like work through stuff. Now I find it really hard to hold a conversation because even if I figure out exactly my word for oatmilk, I remember to request it, and then they ask me something in response and Im like… I don’t know. It is difficult, but when you learn a few words, and then you kind of make some effort to communicate someone it actually makes really good. So yeah, I actually like having it. And I would recommend those people like that they'd have had it in school. Say my friend that came she was at school with me. So she remembered few words and she was able to, like, do a few bits herself. I mean, if it was in German or in some other language like, I don't know if, like I was in China, I’d be fucked. I mean, it does help that I have some familiarity, but it's definitely a shock. Initially, when you realize oh, no, everyone does not speak in English. Just to hear it in the background, its even wierd, like speaking English. Even when I started my job was like, Oh, I can speak English. Okay, you know what I mean? And speaking with the flow as opposed to ummm.. could I … like trying to figure out stuff. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tThis may not apply to you but um any humanitarian or social support services that use like NGO or community service organizations or anything like that did that ever common? ', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tNo. Okay news anything like that? No The only like, humanitarian like NGO like I mean I tried to like set up a volunteering when I came here first but that was for myself to volunteer. I tried to then they were like we will get back to you and yeah, and then because it was before I got the job, so I was kind of like, how can I lose time but then I was like, I don't know if you can Yeah, so I don't know, maybe in time ago nice now that I'm so good and no, I didn't I didn't use it. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tImmigration policy?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tAnd so, the main thing I'll say is that I think we're beyond lucky in Ireland because our passports like qualifies us to go so many places and it's I think we don't realize how easy we have it. Like even someone who went to Canada and we'll talk about at work work, like they qualify to come to Canada but it would like so much harder for them to try and work abroad and like we really move so freely across Europe and like, like, everyone I know. It's like the worsening now I know with Brexit and how that's all changed. But like people in Ireland are always like Im moving to Australia or im mving to Berline, always moving somewhere and you're going to work and apply and you just have to set up your papers, whatever. Even to move to Canada bit extra to do but still fairly straightforward. So a girl from India who I worked with in Dublin. She had such a nightmare. She had to apply for a new visa every year. There was a rule where she… she left Ireland for like 1 day or 2 days in something in this calendar year and if she didn’t, theyd take away her visa. It was just awful. So I was kinda like, Yeah, I don't know they do realise that you work here. So I think it's made me more interested. So it's made me really I know, it's hard because generally, people get into  policy or policies that affect them. So basically, you know, you'll always see people like fighting for cancer research because they're mum died of cance and they are angry and rightfully so and they want something. So it's different when…. I think it’s a big privilege when you got everything handed to you that you're kind of like, this doesn't affect me or is like, I don't know, it's hard because I'm kind of like I said it was the same it feels wrong for it to be easier for one person and harder for another. It feels wrong that people get put in cages in America and deported because they just want to live there. I mean, that's, I mean, that's like a whole other issue, that’s like, asylum and that's like people that actually need to live there. Not just someone like me who’s like “I would like to go to Canada”. I mean, it's so, the privilege we have is completely ridiculous. But yeah, it has made me more, if not involved in it, definitely more like aware of how, like when you hear about people like struggling with little kids, you're like, oh, like I can't believe that you have to worry about that when I don't you know, and it really makes you realize that privilege. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tI think we're kind of almost towards the end of it. I suppose I just want to ask you about the biggest challenges or obstacles that came your way in moving. Is there is there anything that you want to say on that?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tThe mouse. Yeah I can draw a little mouse. I’ll put the mouse because the mouse really affected me, and the health thing and the whole thing I mean, not being able to… like which hospital am I able to go to, what does my insurance cover? Whereas in Ireland it was just like, Ill just go to the nearest clinic. Its an added anxiety maybe. And the it's mainly the social aspect of it, it's not so much that I miss, like, and I miss not having my friends as well. Or that I really miss people that I love all my god, I miss them so much. I really want to see them, I don't have that so much. But it's little things, like habits that you have, and maybe it's an Irish thing of like the drinking culture that we have – its true [laughs] But like even like going for drinks after work on a Friday, like something like that, that I really miss that like it's mainly the weekends when you're…even last weekend and I'm like, I don't have this and it's like, whatever, everyone was like going home and like, have friends coming in. And Im like, I'm just gonna like, chill in my apartment. Do you know what I mean? Bit’s like that makes me feel a bit disconnected. Well, I mean, my friends have literally messaged and talked to me non-stop every day is almost like another job to try and keep up with all the correspondence like trying to get back to everyone. But it's Yeah, they've been very supportive. Yeah, that's the main challenges I mean, being on your own like yeah, I think it's just a big thing as well in that even if you enjoy it any kind of whatever it's different when it's so like say when you’re off over a weekend, there's always something to do when you're home, you have to go home, or meet someone for a coffee, like you to do all your social to do’s. And then when you the morning free to yourself for half a day and youre like yeah I need to go do something for myself myself. That's really nice when it's a choice, but when it's we don't have choice in it, It's doesn't it takes away some of the good from it. So like I'm like, yeah, it's very much enjoying going somewhere on my own. I very much enjoy spending the day by myself, but when you know, I mean, it's nice to still have the option that I might meet up with a person later. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tThey don't really have a culture of like going Friday night drinks?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tI think it really depends. I think it's really the place where we are so I'm literally in a warehouse in the middle of an industrial park. There's no… I think the closest hotel is like a 20 minute walk and there's no cafes nearby there's no shops nearby there. If you forget your lunch there is this like truck that goes by and I think that like, that’s your only option unless you have a car and you can drive to wherever. There's nowhere nearby. And like even when I was coming into the interview, I decided that I was gonna hate this place because I hate the look of industrial parks. You know like, when youre near and airport, you know what that looks like, its like urghh. So I think that's the main issue. We had like a team lunch the first week, you know, because I'm not the only new person who have which makes it a lot easier. And then they were kind of talking about doing like an Oktoberfest thing, and then maybe a drinking thing. And then before the Christmas party, so it feels like they will do social things. But I think it's more difficult to where we are. And they were kind of like, what we're going to go, you know, and then people were like, well, maybe we should just stay here in the office or drink here, because, you know, everyone is pulling from different areas. And they’re like its little warehouse, and if we drink here, you know, someone is going to get injured. And so it's kind of like, where do we go then? Because we need to get a Metro and a bus. It's mainly the location, I think. I mean, everyone there has been really nice, but I suppose it's the same as anywhere when you start somewhere new you're kind of like, I'm gonna be really nice and polite, but I don't know what your personality is. Yeah, I don't know if it's okay to do this, and alcohol just helps with that [laughs]. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd do you plan to maybe change your jobs in the future?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tNo, because a lot of jobs that I applied for, I didn't hear back from. And there was one that was like, super stressy. And they were like, can you do like 50 things to get up to the next stage. Before you will even be interviewed before you even have a chance to meet anyone. So, like I didn't want a high stress job. And this job is not stressful, I don't even think people are checking on me. It's like, amazing, like they're so positive and no one's kind of looking over their shoulder making sure you're doing the work. So I don't want a job that I'm going to be obsessed with or stay late at or, you know what I mean? So I think and because like, find a job and setting up and then get holidays or something like that because I need to take Christmas holidays, I need to take holidays in March, and then that would be six months. And then I'm like, well, what's the point of finding a new job I’m here for a year. I think I'm fairly sure I want to go and stay for the year, if that, if don't like it, I might go home sooner. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOh, really? Okay. So you don't select? I mean, I was gonna that would be my next question. Yeah. Next steps in terms of staying here. You just want to stay here for a year? \", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tI think so. Okay, you know, you never know what might happen. But yeah, like I could end up staying and making more friends find someone here, you never know. But fow now. No, I think I've always seen it as like a short term thing. I'm just here for I just want to be here for a while… I want to challenge myself to live on my own. I want to challenge myself to go somewhere completely new and completely different. Find a job like all these things, Like Im done with some of the hardest parts now. And now its just like adjusting. Like I don't know if this part is going to be the hardest because it's always different when your mind’s occupied it has so much to worry about. Like, oh I need to find my apartment, now I need to find a job, and my friends visiting but once they go and you know it starts to snow it's going to be a bit more like, okay, now you have to like, not only be okay living here, but try and enjoy it as well. I think quite keep it short term, like a year or maybe even less than a year, then I'll probably make the best out of this place. I think it's if I keep the short term, I'm really trying to value it and I'm like no, enjoy yourself. I mean, you're not going to have this next year you're going to be home and Dublin or go away and you want to be like I wish I was on my own again. So I'm kind of like trying to be you know, trying to enjoy it as much as I can.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd I was just wondering also your any aspect of romantic relationships. That sort of does that any is does that say the role anywhere? Is that a motivation at all?', '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tSo before I moved to here, so I was in a long term relationship for about six years, and that ended badly. So that was I think summer 2018. I think initially, your initial thing is like, I gotta move out, I gotta do something. I gotta cut my hair. I gotta go.. And then I was like, No actually gonna keep going and like, cuz I wanted to eave my job in summer 2018. And I was going to move to go away with him. And that was the whole plan. So then I was like, Okay, this big thing just happened. I don't want to change something else big in my life. You know, you've got your base, who youre with and your job. So I was like I'm going to say my job for maybe another year, and then I'll do and then I'll figure out something else. So I think that was partly why you wanted to Do something different, but I will say, That's why I came here because I don't like because many people have asked me like, did you move because of the’bad breakup? And Im like Well, no, I didn't mean to get away from anyone.. I didn't move to, like escape or whatever, because it was like, I always want to travel. I knew when I started, that he didn't. And I knew that would be kind of part of my life that I wouldn’t ger to do enough. I was kind of content. I don't think I felt that I was missing out on anything at the time for, I think it was all like, I mean, he knew that too, like many people do, My parents used to say it. They were like, oh, D, S are abroad. But you know, we always thought to be Sarah, you know, everything. And I was like, Yeah, okay, whatever. So it was always something that I knew that I wanted, and then eventually when the opportunity presented itself was like, so yeah, so I think that's why I gave myself a bit of extra time to kind of, coz obviously a breakup is hard, it's almost like I don't want to do this as kind of a reactionary thing. And then by Christmas and I was like all right yeah, I'm feeling good, Still though, I’d like to be single for a little while. Obviously when I have the long term or the short term idea in my head like that I'm not going to be living here for years and years. I mean it may be if I was in Ireland it might be different for I mean, I'm not definitely not actively seeking a relationship nor would I I mean, again never say never. I mean my parents were like you could me meeting someone in Montreal and stay there for 10 years. But I'm not really romantic like that. I still think I need a lot more time. I had a great year but being in a bad thing like that is hard. When you kind of get out, initially you’re upset but now I'm like, I'm actually really enjoying everyon,  I really like, you know, I like the fact that I'm here. I've never been here. I've never gotten this opportunity. So, it's kind of like it's all for the greater good. Yes, it has made me be a bit more like no to that. So yeah, maybe in a year.\", '', ' ', '', \"M:\\tI just kind of want to get your thoughts on what you feel about it. Is there anything else that you'd like to add to it?\", '', '', '', \"Sa:\\tI think that's fairly comprehensive. And I'm really glad I came here. I think I made the right decision but then again, I think I'm that kind of person any way that I'm like, always be like, like, I never think that was the wrong decision. I'm not huge, like, everything will look like everything is predestined. And it's meant to be and I don't believe that, but I'm still kind of like it was the right decision at the time and if I choose to leave, that would be the right decision. And if I choose to stay for two years and then apply for another visa, that would be the right decision. So im kinda like, I'm really happy I came here, and Montreal particularly It's just like I love it here. Yeah, like I think yeah, it makes you realize what things are really valuable like, like missing friends and family is hard, but also it's kind of like oh, it's really nice to look forward seeing them and to really like value it like means I'm, I can't wait to go home for Christmas but I'm also not we counting my time here. It will be really nice to see them. But it'll be nice to be here too. So, yeah, I think it's good. I'm really glad I did it. I think if I had this I would have heard this. I think it makes you realise so much about yourself and other people when youre on your own. Like, it is harder but it is also such a great learning experience and you learn so much about yourself.M:\\tSo we'll just start with When did you first arrive to Canada? \", '', '', '', \"Si:\\t10th of October so we're just 2019. So that's very recent. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what were the motivations behind your move?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tI wanted to learn a new technology.

I worked as a trainer as well as consultant. So from last two, three to four there is a lot of hype regarding huge data is getting accumulated. And there should be ways in which how you're going to handle the data. When I talk about business intelligence, it is all about whatever data which you have, and the previous data, how the previous data can be used. So, this particular business intelligence model, it only helps us to predict how to work with previous data. But what about the data currently, which we have and how we will predict the future of the data? So that is what is your data science and big data technology. So I was keen into learning the next level as a having them of experience. So I want to evolve from one profile to another. So I'm over here to learn Big Data.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat was the sort of factors that made the decision of coming to Canada like what else were you thinking of? Couldn’t you study in India?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tWhen I think about countries outside like when I think about other countries than India, I'm into this technology space so I know what are the roles available in India for this particular technology. We are we don't have that much projects. Even if I join any any organization and work on onto this technology, I will be considered as a beginner beginner in the sense like I won't be getting profiles or I won't be I won't be getting directly to work on data. I'll be doing some documentation parts so I won't have an appropriate to work like as per my knowledge or As for my the technology, which is which is there in the industry right now. So countries like US, Canada and North America and US and all all these countries, they have advanced technologies, and they are already working in this space. So even though I'm learning big data so Canada, must be the technology space or the education space in Canada must have been ahead. It is talking about artificial intelligence and it's talking about emotional intelligence as of now. After big data there is artificial intelligence than there is now people are talking about emotional intelligence whereas in my country there is nothing no concept called as emotional intelligence. Till now, so, emotional intelligence is spoken by only a psychologist and people are related to medicine field, but not not this medicine plus technology is not it is not at all like, integrated as of now. So, I wanted to study abroad and I selected Canada\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAre there other countries that you considered?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tI found the process visa process for Canada easy. And, I selected Montreal as my friends have already done the course from this college so I had… I knew the feedback of this college I knew the feedback about the feedback in the sense…the living… and living conditions in Montreal. So it is always better if you have some people around in that same city and they're telling the guide you that these are the things you need to do in six months, one year, two years. So if I have a Guided approach. I was considering Toronto but there it was 2 years, 3 years of study and I’ve already done engineering. I've already done like 10 years of work experience into education industry only. So I have like lot ot… my profile also study and teach, study and work. And also I wanted to study much. So I just wanted one year of a specialization and then get into my space, like the technology space, how it works out and all that. I’ve seen Toronto but there was no 1 year course and as for my expense and budget, it was not that suitable for me. So, I selected Montreal. I gave a thought about studying in the same thing in 2019 Jan and I was about. So I just thought my friend friend told me that there is there are the admissions happening for June 2019 intake. So I just applied, I gave my prerequisites all the prerequisites… I gave my English test. So by March, March, and my academics, everything was done. I send the application and I got a letter of application by April end so I was supposed to come in June, but since I have been I was working and I do wind up that process. So I couldn't join in June. So I had to come here in the October intake. Like what Im thinking…. what is my mindset now… I've got an opportunity to learn and advance specialization. So I will be more keen into this technology related to data gathering and data handling. So, I'm going to just see what are the options that are available after studies after one year so at that time I will consider as well as per the requirement and all that what all countries I can travel to and work in from working based. So when I was doing your research about Montreal, and also there are many universities offering this. So, I might go into the Masters in the same space. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay.

Things went in place. The proper flow happened. The factor is, though, the course which I will be joining, I will pretty much knew that I wanted to do, whatever work experience I have, I want to go to the next level. So, for the next level, I need to be skilled. So if Montreal did not have the college or this course, I would have opted for another, like another city, also Toronto.

So in case if I'm not able to get a part time job and all and I'm not able to manage my expenses then my family will come into play. I'm looking for part time work over here. Into the same skillset… like I have training experience so there are a lot of colleges over here, lots of universities over here, and if they'll allow part time work, I can work as an instructor. If it is something related to technology courses, I can work in a lab assistant.

So, even though I'm I'm 33 right now and single, they allowed me to take my own decision and they said and it is your choice - you decide. If you want to be independent, go and live your life, do whatever you want. There was no pressure at all to get married and all. There was no pressure at all since, since if I talk about my mom… after getting married. At that time, she had just completed her graduation. After she got married, and after five days, she went for higher studies. My father and my father family allowed her to go do her higher studies. So two years she was away from her family. [Laughs] And she is the first person at my in my native to be a teacher. Like 30- 35 years back. So, we belong to a Maharashtrian community. I come from Mumbai so Mumbai is a part of Maharashtra and I come from a Maharashtrian community where we have mainly farming and so even in my native place, there are very few people who are educated and from my native theyve come to Mumbai. So, My father has come to like 35 or 40 years back. So, there were like 10 to 12 people... mainly guys only who moved from that city and they came to Mumbai, and then they started working and. The native city is Sangli. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo in terms of friends, so family, you told me friends and community so did you have any friends here prior to you How did they help?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tI have like, two of my best friends, school friends.

He studied in the same college, he completed his course and now he has moved to Toronto for work. So she told him that my friend is looking for some study opportunities in Canada so can you help her out? She's into the technical field and all and he said that why don't you consider this particular college since you don't…if  you don't want a long term studies. You want a one year course only. So this college offers one year course. So ask her to go to through the website and check it out. So she told me.. On 5th of Jan she told me about this. I checked the website and all.  She spoke to me in the morning around 10 to 11 o'clock. I just surf the website I spoke with my parents and they were like go ahead. So, in one and a half hour I decided which course I want to get into. I spoke with the college, like I wrote a mail to the college stating this all I'm interested into. Is there any  seat available. So the college sent me a list like you have to go through this particular process, then only you will get an offer letter and so by March end and I completed the requirement like giving the English test and gathering my documents and paying the registration fees and all. So the moment I got my IELTS result.. I got it in first week of March. Though I decided in one and a half hour about the college, but I took time to first understand the city, what are the different options regarding the same course, what other colleges are there. So I didn't find those that are… like there are colleges like McGill university, it is very much famous in history. But again, it didn't offer one year course. So it was offering a master course, two years, of course, and one year of work. So I spoke with my parents said, you already have a engineering degree. And you already have 10 years of work. And it depends upon you if you're selecting a 2 year course. And then again, one year of work experience, so my mom compared it with her experiences. After marriage, she did 2 years of studies and then she worked. So she told me what are the problems she faced, when you were studying and you are already married? And in my case, I was not married, I'm not married. So she said what are the problems, What are the things you will face so you decide whether you want to take a one year of studies, like a gap, one year full of concentration on studies. And then you decide to take your life ahead - marriage, ofr work which city, what you want to do and all instead of spending three years on education and then deciding. So, by the time you will be 38-39. So, what will be the life ahead? One year is fair enough for me to explore the city to understand myself and see how I take my life ahead.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tYeah.

I would be interested in, migrating to this country and settle over here. But it all depends upon after my studies, the work permit I get and depending upon the work opportunities I get. As of now for one year my whole and sole concentration will be on the studies.', '', '', '', \"M:\\tIs this a Master's Course \", '', '', '', 'Si:\\tIt is not a master course. It is what you can call it as a diploma course or a certificate course because the same college it has two years if master’s course also available. But since the college is offering this kind of course to working professionals who already have some working experience. So, instead of spending two years on the same course, they are like you take the certificate program and it has some 10 months of learning and then two months of internship…a project to do it and you are industry ready to switch from one role to another role.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tRight okay and is it is there a language barrier somewhere I mean, considering the euro and the French speaking part of town, do you find that that is the case?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tSo, as of now Im only into it for two three days. So, what I have observed is in trains and all the instructions are also in French. Even the bill which we get the grocery bill, those are also in French. So, the technology is so, what do you say, it is helpful you just download google translate into you know, French dictionary and you come to know what it is exactly. But what I feel is if you are migrating from one place to another place, you should be adaptable to that particular place. So, I should have done a French course earlier… I should have done it, at least the basic so that by communicating... I would be able to communicate with people or when I when my roommates and they're applying for a job. So, they are also like technical people. So, when they are going for some job opportunities, they go they do the interviews also and then in the end they come to know that they need bilingual people. Which is also pretty much perfect. Why? Because if they are working for a, working as a customer sales representative and if the client is speaking in French, and if they're not able to handle their query, so then what is the point? So they need to be equipped with the language also. So that is a problem which they are also facing so that the government is providing French education. So for students, for immigrants, free education is given. So we can take help from that. We are into this country, the country is also giving us so much facilities so it should not be a problem. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAre you gonna take French courses now that you're here? \", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tYes, I'm going to apply it depends upon the availability in the sense that the batches are limited. So I don't know when I will be getting the batch. But if I want to stay into this country and work over here, I need to be equipped with whatever is their prerequisite. So I will be doing the classes. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd in terms of visa applications, like were you looking at different types of visas that were available to you or student visa was in your mind. I mean, could you have come directly on PR?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tYes, I thought about PR. But I just I did a research on it. I'm single. I'm 30 above. So, my CRS, my score, which is required, it is not. It is not matching with whatever the current score is. So, I knew after doing a one or two day research, I knew that I won't be getting a PR because my match my score won't be that high. So I'll be doing if I'm considering for PR, I need Canadian work experience and Canadian study experience. So, to bring the score up. Yeah. So if I'm, since I’m on study visa, I'm getting a one year of study experience. I'm getting one year of work experience. So the PR process will be easier after two years or three years. I can consider like I can consider for PR. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how long did you take? In arriving?', '', '', '', 'Si:\\tThe visa process… I took time. I got my offer letter in April end. But I applied for my', '', \"study visa in July. First week of July I applied it and then it took Four weeks to get it. I've done everything on my own. So I didn’t hire any consultants to do it. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tTell me how you consider yourself to be a skilled migrant?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tA lot of opportunities are available for skilled migrants. Im skilled – you go into any part of the world, you are into technology space, the world works around in different domains. So whether you are coming from an Asian country or European country, if you are, you have a background of a technology, the technology is going to be same everywhere. It might happen that that country might have an advanced technology. But there might be some places where the basic is required. So according to that, I do consider myself that I am skilled. In my country, I might be at the higher post, but over here, that particular profile, I won't be getting into this country, the profiles. The technology which is being used, it might have might have gone to the next level. So I can join from the starting level. I think even if I'm switching from one role to another role I need to start from scratch only. I can't say that I was Highly skilled at this role. So when I'm switching to the next role role, give me give me the position at that place, like at par. It can't happen. It never happens.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo what were your options? ', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tIn my case, what I did after working in the industry for 10 years, I wanted a freedom kind of thing, I didn’t want to do nine to five jobs. So luckily what I did I worked for an NGO. So I worked for NGO for one and a half year. And so, over over there I understood what is the exact need of like, imparting technologies like what will be the use of technology. When you're working into the industry, you're working for another client, those are also technology driven. But the NGOs, they are not that much as par with the technology. So, they are into like basic, below basic level you can say. So, these are the people these are these are the sectors which needs to be, what you say, brought up. So, luckily I worked for 2 NGOs. Then this particular opportunity came up. So then I said that you have given enough time for the NGOs. And now let's consider, let's go to the next level, move from one place to another place, then let's, let's explore life. So, 10 years of, you can say, machine life, then one and a half year of new new life in the sense …into an environment which is not technology driven, social life, social life. So, over there also I faced problems in the sense that there were people who were not that much technology driven so they need to be explained and then then they were supposed to understand each and everything. So again, it was it was difficult. It was stressful because for them to know, the scrums and all, that is all new but for us we are used to it. When you're working we are used to it and then we get irritated, like “why I have to explain you each and everything again and again”. But for them it is new. So, I found those kind of problems over here, but then I learned patience. Actually, I have learned patience. Like how to understand how to explain a layman. What all things you're doing day in and out. So, I thought the same thing I tried with my family. I thought first I started explaining things to my dad. This is how my life has been for whatever new thing I have to get into, my family was like lets first explore, first understand it so that when you when you step out in the world you know that you will know what are the things, what are the problems that you will have so let's discuss in the family. Yeah so luckily I have that kind of family. My parents are they know what are the future things like what are the future problems my child will face so they used to prepare us in that way so from school colleges and all. In school also like while going to the college This is how the world is already in the most to travel, these are all the things you need to do on your own. So they started preparing us two years prior only and then they told us now go and step into the world. So they're [parents] calling every 15 minutes. So for them, they also sleep as per Canada time. Theyre worried. But now that they're like… before coming here I spoke to them and they were like “very good, go out and speak and meet people and understand them”. And let's see. For the, it is always like they should be, they should be aware of what she is doing and whatnot. And for me, it is like, for the first time was like an independent life. Though there were no restrictions. But always I knew that if I'm stuck, I have my brother. I have my mom and dad to help me. But now since you said that you share the Google Map and I will not know how to understand it and all. And so then I thought of connecting with my brother because what is that you did? But I landed over here. Like in Mumbai, we are used to Uber. So I was just looking at the options but then I realized that I don't have the data pack. I don't have the internet and so I just did my roaming. On roaming, so he just called me and he said what? I don't know. I will just wait and I will let me understand it. Then he texted me that these are all the steps are supposed to do and this is how I landed to this place.  So at times also when when I'm in the room, there it India also it would pretty much be the 5 of them so mostly speaking to them only. I have less friends. So you're also sometimes like sometimes like ….most of the time I feel lonely, like no one to talk to. But then through whatsapp and facebook, theyre connected to me. So ideally what they will do they will record a message…they will record a video and they will send me, like “what you're doing and all so that I don't feel lonely that I would feel that yes Okay. So in a night It's morning over there over there so I'll keep on doing those videos so that I don't feel homesick. So it is like when you have a conversation, a telephonic conversation so that during that part when you have those people contact. But they decided this idea of having a video recording, the video every now and then. So even after the conversation is done like after one hour or two hours you feel lonely again, just go and see the video. So, you feel that he is he is there in front you.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tso first, tell me about the visa categories that you were considering at the time of your move. Now, in your case, it was very straightforward, right? So basically, what you want to put there now is your visa status, including how long it took to wait for the visa. Visa processing time so so for example, you may start from January where you started planning it and how long did it take to get the visa..', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tSo Jan 2019 I came to know about the option, the study option. So that same time I thought of considering the work option, like work visa, if I could get a work visa since I have the relevant experience and about PR, PR option as well. So work option, not possible from the home country. I didn't apply. I have friends working over here and they said that you need a Canadian experience and then only you can get an opportunity over here. And so I didn't give a thought about it. So not possible from home country without local work experience. And PR – current score – so mainly age factor – then I had the marital status. So when youre married you get your partner's points, like primary applicant and secondary applicant and the scores can be added up. So because of these two factors, otherwise the rest of the factors were good. But these 2 factors affected my score. Then I considered studies. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd tell me I mean, I think this goes into the next question pretty much. So what did you do for your study? So I know that you said that you didn't hire any agents or consultants, but anything that you paid for. So think about document translation, IELTS, medical, any process that you have to do that you have to pay for commercial.\", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tNothing. I didn’t pay for anything. The website is very much clear. They mentioned what all you have to do. So, I didn’t pay for anything. Neither for my visa process also. I just applied for the IELTS, there are a lot of materials available on internet, A lot of forums which you can print out. Okay for the exam I had done the payment, but not for the training. People are paying for the training. The visa fees I paid, the medical test fees I had paid. So for the study option I need to get my transcript. I got the transcript in 2 weeks so in Jan itself I got my transcript. Then I did my IELTS registration so the fees I paid. This happened in Feb 2019. I got my result in... I cleared my IELTS exam. This happened in March 2019.  Then I submitted all the documents…submitted relevant documents I will write…to the college April 2019. And I got my letter of acceptance…acceptance I got in April itself. So after I got my letter of acceptance, then the college had mentioned those steps that I need to follow after getting acceptances I need to take permission from Quebec so there is one documentation, CAQ certificate you need to get. Quebec province says that if you want to come to our province, then you need to have a permission. So, you need to have the certificate. So I applied for the certificate and in total four weeks to be processed and then I got the acceptance. This was like $5000 or $6000 rupees. So it’s the ministry of Quebec. We need to write that we are intending to come to the province for studies since this is a French speaking province in the country so – rest all the provinces, they are majorly English speaking. This is the only province which has the French as the major language. So they need from like, they asked people the permission. So then they gave me the permission saying that yes, you are allowed for studies. So I had to do the CAQ… applied in April in 2019. I got a reply that was positive. I got it in May 2019. After that I was asked to pay fees and then the security funds. GIC loan. Paid half or 6 months tuition fees. That I did in May itself, May 2019. Paid my GIC amount. This is an investment certificate which we need to as a student you're supposed to do. Well you're saying that this is the fund which I have. So in case, its kind of security fund which you are putting in, so that in case is in the future if you don’t have any funding, you don't rely on government for funding because government provides facilities to PR to their citizens also. But we are coming from outside countries as students so they cannot accommodate us to have any support. So this is $10000. It is self funded. So there are Scotiabank and there are some other banks also. One other bank has started it otherwise before it was Scotiabank only. So $10,000 which we are paying, every month the government gives us back. So, this is divided into 12 months. So government gives you back so that you can bear your expenses and everything. It's not like you’re relying on the government. Like youre not homeless, you don’t have anything to do and all. The government has decided that youre coming to the country, you’re coming for your studies, you pay the security funds and then utilise that when you’re staying here. So it took one month to get my certificate and all. So after May, one month I took a break because I had everything, I just had to apply for my visa. For my visa I had all the documents and all, so I took a break, I went to see all Maharashtra. So I explored the different cities in Maharashtra. It was awesome. I never knew in my life that there was all these cities. I went to Aurangabad, and Sherdi religious place and I explored Pune with my family. It was a family holiday. Then my native place also, Sangli. Then met all my relatives at all before moving out of the country. So I met everyone. Then I applied for the visa in July… and receive visa in July itself. I applied on the 3rd of July. I got it in three weeks.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo we'll move on from those questions. Now. We'll ask you. I want to know I mean, it's somewhere here. You would have done a medical test as though right?\", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tYeah. medical test. I did it. Umm so last week of May I did my medical test. Like two or three days prior to my appointment was on third of July. So it takes only one day for the medical. That's a half day. So I did it on 27th or 28th of May.  So here also theres something called the biometrics which we have to do. That was done on the same day, when we apply for the visa through VFS. So I applied it offline. So I had an offline process. So then I came under this non-SDS category. This is for working professionals. It's like there are two things SDS and non SDS. There are students who complete their higher studies – like 12th standard or graduation. Those who don't have gap any gap between their studies, they they come under SDS and those people who have a gap after studies they have one year of experience two years of experience, they will come under non SDS. So, this is suitable for people like working professionals. This is the student direct stream. So you have a certain level of education and then afterwards you're coming for a masters or a PhD. So you have done your masters in your country and then the next one, you are coming over here so you don’t have any work experience. So non SDS is for working professionals or those who have a gap. Since I did offline, so I had to do my biometrics. Same Day and submit my files. This I did from from VFS global. it is easier for the for the visa team to process. So when you say non SDS, they will ask for work experience documents. So, it is like the the form… the form which is created. Here you need to show gap letter. If you have a gap after your studies, so the gap can be working or else relevant clarification. So those who are working, they will show their work experience like joining letter, leaving letter and all. I showed my work experience because I was working till June. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo let's just work on these maps. Now you pretty much will be basically keep adding information in the same map, because now the questions are about these processes in a little bit more detail. So in terms of let's talk about technology. So how has technology supported your migration from the initial stage till now? Technology meaning, conduct online research, what resources or websites used, social media that you used, and current social media that you use in your journey now as well even to maybe stay connected with your family, for example, or maps or things like that. \", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tSo basically I used Google website, college website, CIC website. So source is nothing but Google. So basically CIC website is good enough. What I found if you go into the forums there are multiple people who will put their questions. So you will find lot of discrepancy because their experiences and your experiences, there is a lot of difference. So instead of getting confused, you go to the CIC website and then and you have they have a questionnaire and answers provided. So you can do that. CIC website. For transcript, I connected with my college, my college website to understand how I will get the transcript and all. This I got from British Council. I gave an offline exam so it took 14 days for my result to come.  So I submitted my documents. My college had sent me the link.. so here they have a Google form. They have that drive Google Drive on that you are supposed to submit the documents. CAQ also I was supposed to create an account on the website…on the government website. Plus, they mail you the letter. Post the letter.  So you have a physical copy. So what happens when they send you an electronic copy it can be editable. Here it is a certificate. So the certificate can be mishandled it can be edited and all. So they send a physical copy. So this copy is required at the airport, it is required at the immigration and all. When I landed, I have to show it at the airport then I was directed to the immigration section, because this is the permission. I used Facebook for understanding the city – city knowledge. Lot of information I got from Facebook for instance it is a historical place, regarding the weather, what are the different places in Montreal, how is the weather, how to cope up with the weather. They have videos which have been posted. There are hashtags. I use Facebook, Instagram, I follow the mtl blog. Im following the account of my college so I was pretty much updated about things happening other activities are happening in my college. I came here on 9th of  October so 1st of October they had a visit the college whichever student they had for June intake and all.. They took those students for a city tour so I got to learn about all this activities, extracurricular activities, colleges networking activities, that I came to know from their Instagram handle. So college and MTL blog – these are the 2 things that I am following. Plus I'm very much into yoga. So the people who are in this city who does Yoga and all, Im following their accounts and then this one thing I follow – Sri Ravi Shakankar – Art of living. This is one Instagram handle. So what they do they conduct a meditation and yoga session. twice in a week, like bi-weekly. This coming Sunday they have a session. So FB and Instagram is more than enough. WhatsApp – video and voice call. So instead of using Skype and all Whatsapp is really good because for Skype the other person needs to have it and all. With Whatsapp your phone is registered and off you go. You have Google Maps very much essential when you are traveling to other country and the city, the country from where you come, you have good transportation facility like train, you have cab you have rickshaws available. But it is not necessarily these facilities will be available in the other country. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay? All right, let's talk about social connections on the map. So now like I said, you just build upon this same map. \", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tSo this is self-funding then sponsored by dad. That’s it. Since he’s retired, he has his retirement fund so that is being utilised. Yeah lot of, umm, when I thought of studies like when I confirm with studies, I wanted to know the culture… like how is the technological culture in the city. So I enrolled to meetup. Yeah, went to this app …meetup app. On that I connected with Montreal Analytics team. Then I connected with women in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This is one community which is doing good work. We're working on this. So, these are the apps that keep on posting the meetups that they conduct. So these are the 2 groups. This is an NGO. So, when I'm when I'm in the city, and I don't have things to do on weekends, or whatever, I need to meet with people, I need to understand the culture I need to understand the technology space. So I'll be going to these meetups and I will be interacting with the people. Oh, that's this is that because Did you go to any meetups yet? Not as of now. I have like I said yoga. Yeah, art of living. So that is happening on Sunday 20th 20th of October. So I'll be going over there. But it also helped me to find out the relevant accommodations and all. Ill be meeting people who are already in Montreal. Students who are already in Montreal. They might help me out. For accommodation, what I have observed over here…whichever buildings are there, so they have already posted if there are vacant flats that are available in that building. So the posters are already available, you just scan the code and physical posters are there, you just scan the code and it redirects you to that website and you come to know if there are rooms available in this. You just connect with them or fill the form and then accordingly, they will reply. So maybe QR code will come somewhere and at the end here, looking for accommodation. So this is all before arrival. Now I can create a map after arrival. So for arrival I will start with airport. So at airport what was required is a token needed to be created that is a profile is created yeah profile of passengers are created. Then the next your CAQ is checked. Your visa is checked. You are redirected to Immigration Department. And then you get your visa permit, here you get your visa – after the immigration. You don't get a visa until you actually arrive. The work permit is after studies. The college mentions that since you are studying over here you can work part time so that is implicit. 20 hours a week. VFS just provided with the visa…visa number. See that is just a number. So, when you come to their country and whatever number you have, based on that number the immigration team understands that these are students, these for study, these are for work, these are for PR. Then they give you the documents. So I got a stamp saying student. So I got my study permit and I was out… out of the airport [laughs]. So very much clear process and staff is very cordial. You need to create your own profile. So there are 15 to 20 computers available. You can do it in five to seven minutes your token is created you after that you have two people who will be checking your certificate, the check it, they tell you to go to the immigration and immigration section there are seven to eight people desks, so even if there are 20 people, each persons check is done in 5 minutes. This is very good over here. They do ask… the immigration people do ask what is your accommodation? Where are you going to stay? Where are you going to go from here? So that is being checked – accommodation and address is checked. We call it as reference. So yeah this would go before. Submitted my file. Visa was approved in July. It takes 2 days to come from Delhi to Mumbai. So, after that I connected with my friends for temporary accommodation. So, I had two months – August, September. So it happened that earlier I was supposed to go to another place and there, there was no vacancy. And in September's first week, it was already occupied. So, then I had to search for another place. So eventually this is the 3rd friends room where I have a like, they accommodated me. 2 months it took me, like I was I was in a dicey position, like where I will stay, where I will stay.. Firstly I was searching for accommodation on Facebook, Kijiji app, Airbnb and all. But eventually I got it through a friend. Accommodation and then I got a cab, Because the address was already given to me. And from airport, this location, it takes 20 minutes. And then they came to receive me near the entrance of the building. Everything is on your mobile phone. Just imagine if you don’t have an internet connection, you are gone. I did my international roaming but I didn’t use the data services. So I did that now, like I got my college registration done, my bank accounts, Then I've got my phone, took another SIM card here and I hot my social insurance number also. I went first I went to the College. So, what I did, in one day itself I did everything - services. So, I had my college registration, in that same building, so college registration is on the first floor, Scotiabank at ground floor. Then there is mall over here. Eaton Mall.. there I took my SIM card, so which is like five minutes away – Sim card - and then I went to Service Canada for my sin number. So this all happened in a span of three hours. So that is the beauty of government working over your. Actually, this is on do in your country. In 2-3 hours, you cant do it. You need three days and all these places are very much nearby. Otherwise in my in my country or my city I need to travel from one place to another place. So, traveling is like 30 minutes, one hour, two hours. \", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHave you looked at immigration policies in general? Do you keep it? Do you keep check on it? And what do you think about immigration policies in Canada?', '', '', '', 'Si:\\tIt is, it is pretty much clear that this immigration…like permanent immigration can happen provided whatever is the score at that time…after two years, or after one year of studies. What is the immigration status, so it all depends upon that time, but I know the basic basic thing that I know if I want to immigrate to Canada, there are certain things, rules in the sense.. So age factor, marital status, your Canadian studies, Canadian work experience, So after completing my studies, if I if I fit into the age factor, if I fit into the marital status so that point is going to be constant. My Canadian work experience might add some points my Canadian studies will add some points. And if I get a score, and that score is as par with the CRS score, So I can get PR. It all depends upon future. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tRelationships?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tMoving to another country and as a single person, it is very obvious you would like to interact with people, you would like to get into a relationship, but it all depends upon how it happens. And since there's a new country, new place, basically Montreal – this is like a French speaking province, so there will be a language barrier. So I don't know how it will happen.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tWould you have to marry an Indian person only doesn't matter where you?\", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tIt doesn’t matter and it didn't matter when I was in my country also. In fact it would be very good if I didn’t marry an Indian person [laughs]. Because when you are thinking of settling,  you have already taken a decision of moving from one country to another country. So your mindset is about exploring the places, so why not exploring relationships and why not exploring this aspect of your personal life also? Like, in my case, 33 half of my life I've spent in one country and didn’t do this… I was in a relationship and things couldn’t work out. So I couldn't take our decision to get married. So now, now, my mindset is here I have like, I don't have a burden of working. It is pretty much clear that I'm studying I have, so I will be having some time on the weekends. So it all depends upon my study schedule and how it is, I need to have, like, I have to say, in my bucket list, I have made sure that I'm going to go out and meet people, which I have not done in my work life, like for 10 years, or employed so that I have to do it over here, because what I feel is this is the one year which I've got. I've got it from my family as well as the opportunity I've got to understand myself and take a step on it. Tinder I have used in my country. It is of no use and the app has a very negative response and all. I don't know about other apps. On Facebook, you guys come to mobile lot of apps and all like, okay, okay. Okay. See the love that you have. But I don't want to rely on those apps. What I feel is if you start socializing, you start meeting new people like I have an opportunity to. I can meet someone in my college also. And I'm like, I'm a big fan of Shahrukh Khan. So I will tell you one experience Yeah. So like from I'm a die hard fan Shahrukh Khan. So before coming on the last day for my friend's birthday, they prepared one slam book. So the last page was Shahrukhs pic and my pic. So they had written a message that hope hopefully you will, you will meet him some day. So what happened when I went when I went to my college for registration, my college is at the first floor. So there was one guy. I just entered the lift so there was myself and two guys who live. So one of the guy he spoke to another guy, he said… he was greeting him hello. So the other guy told him Do you know me? He said yes, we met at Apple. So then he introduced himself, “I'm Shahrukh” [laughs]. So when he introduced himself he said “Im Shahrukh and Im from Pakistan”. And Im like Shahrukh!!! [Laughs]. After 10 minutes I just messaged my friend I said that you wrote in the slam book that I will meet Shahrukh and I met Shahrukh in my college. So you know Bollywood movies? So Shahrukh’s last movie was jab Harry Met Sejal. So in that, the tagline and what you seek is seeking you. [laughs] So, my friends, everyday they message me and say – did you meet Shahrukh? I am like, no I haven’t gone to the college again but I'm very much eager. So what happened after the lift… I went to my college and did all the process. Then I have one of my student is working over here. So he told me that why don’t you come to McDonalds? So, I went to McDonalds and Shahrukh had come to McDonalds as well. So I was telling my friends that you’ve written in my slam book and I have met Shahrukh. It is not Shahrukh Khan but it is Shahrukh. I am following him… not following him, like seeing him but he doesn’t know that this girl is looking at me.  So that gives me a high point over there okay fine. I can look around people and I can meet people and people oh you're a very positive, very cordial…like they speak… they are very friendly. Even at stores, I went to all the government offices and the life was very easy. Otherwise when you go to a government office in your country, first of all you feel scared then the second thing is you’re already scared, and then people don't talk properly. They talk rudely. And also First of all you’re scared, you're not that ready you take elder person from your family to go to the government office and then your attitude and their attitude dont match. So it's your family members always say that whenever you're going to a government office make sure you're taking an elder person who has very good high level of patience because its a government office. If you speak rudely and if you speak with your attitude, the work is not going to happen. So take someone who is elder and who has very good level of patience. That thing I didn’t observe over here. It was a good thing and I was little bit sceptical.. if they ask some questions that I'm not able to answer or it might happen I might get hyper and all. Even my family was amazed that in three hours you did all these things and that too being alone. Im like yes, I did it. [laughs]. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay I supposed to mean I'm look I'm done in terms of like the only thing I think I want to ask about now is whether your family will also come here at some point to visit you or to see you if, if and what your future plans are in general like what you would not like to do next next steps.\", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tMy family – I don’t think so they would be coming over here because my stay is, as of now, it all depends on my year one year of completion. Then again there will be an approval for the work permit. I have go through an approval process. So as of now I don't know, in my mind is only studies study like the one year of studies. Then our next I don't know like, if I'm calling my family what is the process and all …I suppose it is visit visa now. But again, again, there are some there must be some prerequisites for visitor visa and all. I have not given any thought about it and my family's also not thought about it. So that would be in future if I get a work permit again. What are the criteria for family coming to the country and all? No idea. \", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, looking at your map, how do you feel about it? Is there anything that you want to add to it? ', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tTouch wood - my flow was very much clear and it was step by step because when I see other people, like my roommates also, they had a very tough immigration process in India. So, they had their visa rejection also happened and all. So in my case, what I observed is they, they were not having that much knowledge. So, luckily, in my case what I did before applying even everything, I made sure that I have 75% of the knowledge regarding what I'm doing next. So, even I was thinking that 25% I might go wrong, but 75% I have a knowledge about this. This also.. the government work and all… I made sure that I read proper content and then I went to them, again French people in the offices, there were talking in French. So, I made sure that how to greet them in French. I made sure those I know those words their accent I need to understand and all what I observed when I went to Service Canada My name they pronounced in another way. Even there were people sitting so the pronunciation of the name was very much different so there were some two three people the name was called several times but they couldn’t understand that their name is being called. So its all like how adaptable you are  and how you're prepared… t\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat has been the biggest challenge?', '', '', '', \"Si:\\tThe biggest challenge observed was in Frankfurt – in my layover. So my flight was delayed from Mumbai. So, I had a span of like 30 minutes to move from that, that section to my boarding session, so I had to run like anything. So I thought that Oh my God, if I missed this flight, what was going to happen? I didn't knew what what would be the next options and all and the funds are not there. So even in your country, if you could happen that you miss a train, a flight or a bus, you know that you have funds, you will do something about it. And no internet or no internet connection. And the mind was also not working like what am I going to do. Like, I met a guy. He helped me because he was also moving to that same gate. So he helped me. He helped me a lot into that. We both were running and all and like in 20 minutes I reached there. Even the airport staff, they were good. But they also couldn’t do anything because I had to run anyhow, I had to rush. That was the biggest challenge. Because at that time even thinking now is like if I couldn't make it in in that 30 minutes then what next. Those 30 minutes were like, something… Then when I was sitting in the flight I was thinking, what if I missed it. When I came over here and shared this with my family and my brother was like there is no problem. You are supposed to go to the airport authority the whichever like I came from, I took Lufthansa, So just go to their section. So then they will book another flight or they would have contacted India or they would have… like something could have been done. I was like this option, at that point, I wouldn't think of. And this was the first international flight so I never knew that this all options are there. So its good that I am moving out and when other members of my family will move, they are well equipped with all this possibilities. They also helped me a lot. And I'm like lucky that they knew that these all possibilities would come. So they were prepared with this and we were doing it because they also connected with their friends and they did the research and all. I was very much relying on my family that yes, if nothing could happen, yes, they are there they will help me anyhow and they will do it.\", '', '', '', '[this process of your move has become your family’s process] ', '', '', '', \"So I tell my friends that I have a very progressive family literally, moving at this age, it is not at all possible. I have my friends who are single and they are also giving a thought about coming to like moving out of the country after working 10 years, 12 years,  they spoke with their family and they got a clear rejection. Its like you're not allowed to go. Its their mindset. They don’t want them to move out. Just because you're not married, you cant move out. Like two of my best friends, they are very much keen, not only to this country they're they're like… they wanted to move at least from Mumbai to somewhere else in the same country. But theyre not allowed. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tHow do you feel about drawing the map because this is a new thing that I'm trying to do.\", '', '', '', \"Si:\\tIts like revisiting the days from the last eight to nine months, eight months, It feelsn Nostalgic.

So I decided I would speak to them, but I will speak after two to three months and when they when they realize that, how happy and how I'm able to execute it. So it all depends upon how I face things over year and how I go from one level to another level over you, then they will get the confidence that yes they can send their daughter.M:\\tSo firstly, let's just tell me when did you come to Canada first? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tOkay, so like if you're asking me exactly for vacations or you just want me to just tell you like exactly when I actually moved? So, when I'm came for vacation that was when I was maybe like 10 years old. Okay. was a long time ago. Right now I'm 22. So I'm guessing like the 2010. Yeah. And it's only for vacation. So we just came. So my mom, married. Sorry, my mom met this guy back in 2010. And he was in the in the business kind of thing. She went and met his boyfriend at that time. And then, like, they got a connection. And then they had like, it was like, sorry, my English is so bad. So basically what happened is like, they meet and then they start talking to each other. And then they have a really good deep relationship. So it was like a long distance relationship kind of thing. It was really good. I mean, we love the guy. I mean, he was really good with us. He was cool with her. And he always invited us to Canada. The first time I went to Canada, it was in Alberta, no, sorry, it was Qcebec. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo that was he was Canadian. And they went to they met in Mexico?', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tYeah. So he went for vacations. And my mom was going for a business trip. Oh, so they met in there and then they had a connection and it was awesome. Then they started like having going deeper in their relationship. And then we started going together. We went to Quebec as a family, my brother, me and my mom and him. And we went to a sister in Quebec, and it was amazing. I love that place. And we always have the opportunity to say like, this is an amazing country. We should live here right? Yeah. We never came across. It was only got like, kind of like a vacation kind of thing right. Then after that, when we came it was in Alberta, again with my mom and then I came with just myself. My brother, I think he stayed in Mexico. And that was in 2000… You're making me think…. long time. I think it was in 2012. We come back to Alberta. We went to Banff. It was beautiful. We stay there for a long time. And then after that, we came... My mom stay there from Mexico. We stay there for a little time. And then they decided to just get married. That was in 2015. So, after three years, they they after the relationship was good and everything. They broke up, I think, for one or two years. And that was like the gap of a few years they broke off and then they came back. And then he decided to say like, hey, like, you know what, let's get married. Bring Dante, bring everything. Let's just go there. And my mom asked me she was like, What do you think? And that was I was 17 by the time. So, it was kind of like a hard decision. Yeah. Like, it wasn't like kind of like, I was so excited. You know, like when they tell you 17 go to the new Canada and new country. And mean it was so good. And I love to, like, I loved this country. Like when I met them here, everything what I did and here in Canada when I was on vacation, I was like, Yes, I wanna live here. So yes, I came in 2015 when I when I moved.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo in terms of motivations behind your migration, like did you when you when your mom told you like, think of like, what are your thoughts like, what did you consider in your, in your personal sort of mind like in making that decision to ', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tSo one of the main problems was, I guess it was school wise. So because we don't we didn't know what's going to happen, right. I was in in high school at that time in Mexico City. Okay, so I was kind of like finishing in my second year of high school. I wasn't doing that great to be honest with you. Yeah. I wasn't doing great in school. At that time. I was like, mostly partying, you know, in high school, partying, friends going out and everything. So my mom told me like, it's a big decision, you know? She lost her job. So, it was a good thing for her. Like, she, she she lost it. So I'll tell you what was the behind of it. So my mom, she worked for a pharmaceutical for maybe 16 years. A long time. She got a good job and she got to pay. We live really good play with all the time was private schools in Mexico City. We got like a really good life. And my mom, she always worked hard for stuff. She was a lonely parent. And so she was it was really complicated for her right. But at the end of the day, she did it. She brought two kids. So both of us were really. Right now at this time, so I'm like she's proud of us and I'm proud of my mom. Right? And she was the main. She's the still one of my thoughts that she makes me keep going. right. Um, she, after she lost her job, it was so hard for her to actually find another job. So, because of her age, right, in Mexico City is really hard to actually find a job as a woman and as a as your age, right? Like, they don't take you seriously. My mom is an accountant and she has her degree. She was she's a professional worker. And unfortunately, she couldn't find a job. But she find a job good job. Like when she was in the middle of when she broke up with, with Frank, or with his ex-husband. And it was a good job too. And she she loved the job. She She liked it. And she was like, Well, I'm gonna stay here right? When this person actually offer us to go to Canada. It was a big deal too for her. There was a lot of problems. The thing is first, her job, then my school that was one of the important things because I'm 17 right so I have to go with her. It's not like a question on matter to say like, oh, you're staying here in Mexico and then I'll go there. No, it's like a family thing like to bring everything from there right? In Mexico for her was really it was like that's why she asked me because she told me like, well, you're not going to have school. You're going to finish your a year and then I might lose I'm gonna lose my job and here and also the problem was the house. She has a house she owns a house in Mexico, and it's with my my dad. Right? Unfortunately with my dad she always have problems with him. So it's kind of like…it was it was kind of hard and that time I guess. I'll say one of the motivations… that basically what you asked it was…we needed like a clean slate. I think we was an escape, you know. I think my mom was tired of it. She saw an opportunity to live with someone with… her love of life. And to bring me there. I think it was a plus too, right? I mean, I didn't say no, I just, I was so excited about it. I think I saw a great opportunity to be here. I mean, I even invested like, into my research and everything. And I thought, like, you know what, it is a good opportunity, you know what I mean? Like, I could finish school in there. I didn't thought that it was like, kind of like a much of a loss. But now that I think it is, we lost a lot of things… we lost…it's a culture wise. I mean, it was a change of culture. It was a change of people. It was a change, a family, it was change of everything that was surrounded by us, right. And it was just taken away. Right. Like, for me, my perspective was taken away and then just coming through the country, right. So yeah, I think that's that's one of the things that I don't know if I answer your question, but I don't know like\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd so where's your mom? Now she and she's in Canada? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tShe's in she she has a permanent residence. but she was she right now she went back to Mexico to fix her legal problems with… with the house with the house. Yeah, just, it's half my dad's and half hers. It is still like kind of a problem in there. I mean, my dad is he doesn't want to see any of us that he doesn't wanna see me, doesn't see my brother, See my mom. So it's kind of like, hard. I mean, I already forgave him so. So I really don't mind. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd so the partner that she was with in Canada, is she's still with him?\", '', '', '', 'Da:\\tNo, they got divorced.

[laughs]', '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd professional background. So let's talk about professional mean, you moved here when you were really young, you still had school to do. So did you what type? Like what how did that sort of that translate into current professional life? What what happened from there? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tThe thing that I find most interesting in this in this country is that they don't accept anything that is from Mexico. So, so any any background or anything that you have or anything like that, it's just like zero. Like when you come here, it's just you start like again. Yeah, so when I came here to to Edmonton, I thought, like, okay, so I have in my high school, can you accept my two years and say, No, you have to do an exam. And then from that exam, we will put you somewhere. Unfortunately, when I went to high school in that time, I was 18. So I was 17 at that time when we moved in, but then I turned 18 right away, right. So in the laws in there and Edmonton unfortunately when you are a 18, you're not you're not a dependent, right? So the reason why we have to move that fast is because I had to be with my mom when 17. Right? Because otherwise they wouldn't take me. They wouldn't say like, No, he's an adult, he has to make his own application. So for the application, that's the whole reason why they took me when I was 17. Right. After when I was 18 in there, they don't accept any high school students. Thankfully, I don't know how but like my like how the school was in Mexico. It actually like my level. It wasn't that bad. I was like, almost finishing. When I came here, I did my high school, maybe one year. I didn't finish high school. It was an option. The reason why is because I saw an opportunity and I plan it. My plan was to basically to only finish the courses that I need to go to college right? from college, go to university. That was my whole point and my mom agree with it. And even her husband agreed, Right. And he was like, Yeah, that's a great idea. I mean, and I was going to the trades kind of thing. environment. And that's the whole reason why I took that that path, right? unfortunately didn't work. It didn't work as well as I thought but yeah, like I did. I only have I don't have my high school diploma. But I have the like, the knowledge of it, basically. So I have the courses to actually go to college? If I want to go to college right now, I can, because in here the system… they only asked you for something. Like if you have math and English passed… then you can go to college. You don't need to have a high school diploma. Right. You only need a high school diploma if you want to go to university, right. So in my thought it was like, at that time, I was thinking about the price, right? So university’s really expensive. Yeah, right. So I was thinking so I can get college. And then once I go to college, then I can go to I can pay less. Then once it pay less, and then after the year and I become a permanent resident and everything, I will pay less for university. So on time being, I can actually be in college and then go to university. So that was a whole point. So that was the that was my thinking, right? Go to college, pay less. And then after I have my degree or something, I will go to university. It was a good plan at the time. But like, if you're asking me for any professional background, I don’t have any. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tso you're working in the bank right now. So how did that happen?\", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tSo how that happened? So basically, in the bank, they don't ask you for for that. They don't ask you for high school diploma. So and it's about experience and much more about customer service. I think I learned a lot. I have a lot of experience. And that's what actually taught me. I've been working in the customer service …in the industry for a long time. And I think I know how to do it Good. I guess sometimes when I don't know if you heard that before, when people they tell you like, you don't need education for actually be successful. And, and it is true. I mean, it's about how you have a connection with people and how you actually can interact with them. Right. So I learned that and it been helping me for a long time, right. So yeah, and I was actually trying to go to do the school. My thinking is still going to school because I do still want to go to school. Next year, I'm planning to go to school… to university or to college. Well, first to college and and you know, right so, but I'm still debating which where to go right. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd what do you want to study? ', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tLike I said, it's it's a really hard decision, because there's a lot of paths in the in the banking industry. They're opening me a lot of doors. They already offer me two jobs. Like as a financial advisor? I just need to do, like a license to sell mutual funds and to talk about mortgages or any ideals kind of thing. So, yeah, like I mean, I do I'm gonna do it in this year. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAll right, so Okay. I suppose I mean this question. I don't know whether this applies to you really. But like, if, if you can remember or I suppose think about in terms of time, how long did you plan your move, prior move? Was there any planning at that time that went in your patos? Was was that all sort of that taken care of by your mother? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tIt was actually really fast. It was in a one year period. Because my mom plan it really good with him, okay, and they plan it in a way that we can actually move together as a family. Right. So it was not a big planning on my on my way. I did, I have to do a lot of things right. Like I had to finish a lot of things in Mexico City. I had to finish my degrees in there from high school before I actually leave, my passports I have to do all I have to do all by myself, because my mom was working at the time. So I actually helped my mom to do all those kind of like, paperwork, paperwork. And she was she was she needed the help. So she was so happy about that. Right. I helped her for a lot of things, because most of the things were in English, so I had to translate for her and I did explain her and detail what actually the things they need. Mostly we did them… I think it we would have planned in, we wouldn’t be here if I if I'm honest with you. If we wouldn't make that rush decision, I don't think we would’ve been here. The non-planning worked, I think, I think in in this sense yes. Because if we would have seen maybe like in, in a long term kind of thing, I think we, I would’ve said no. Or my mom would say no too. After all that we have struggled. And after all that we have seen and what we've gone through, I think I would say no. And my mom, the same. I think we would be better in Mexico. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tYou would be better in Mexico, you think this now?', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tNot like life wise, but we would never go through that stage. I mean, through that period of time. I like, I didn't like that struggle to be honest with you. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd what was that struggle if you don't mind? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tYeah. So I'll explain. So I'll tell you the story, basically. So what happened is that he married she married. My mom married this guy. They've been together for maybe six years. Their relationship was good. Everything was amazing. Like we went to trips together. He came to Mexico. We have always good time. We have fun with him, right? I even see him as a dad sometimes, right? Like, I did like him and it hurts me because he's now that I think about it. It's just like, I lost two father figures, right? Like one that I like, my my dad that doesn't recognize me as a son. And then the other one…that I thought, I could have a dad and then it just got taken away, right. So basically what happened is like after a year, we live in there. It was a struggle with him. I guess the reason why I think he lost, he lost his job in Edmonton. So he was living by his pension, and he just got divorced recently, too. And then he lost half of his money right with his ex-wife. So everything was really tight with him, like with kind of money wise. At the beginning it wasn't. At the beginning, everything was perfect. Like maybe the first four, three months. It was really good.  I didn't complain when my mom didn't complain or anything. But we thought that we had a future in there with him. We were planning, like planning about all these things… school, I was planning about my school, I was planning for a lot of things. Then it got to a point where money was one of the main problems. So I had to start working. I work as a bartender back in Edmonton. First as a busboy, you know, bussing tables, and my manager loved me. So, all the servers love me too. They love the way I interact with clients. So, they told me Hey, you want to be a bartender? I was like, Yeah, for sure. So, I started being a bartender. I love that job. I love the people that I met in there it was so nice. I I was feel at home. I met some… so good friends in Edmonton and I still talk to them. I mean, I miss them. My best friends I ever had. Then after that, we lost... He was getting into a depression kind of mode. Because he was at home every day. So because he doesn't have job doesn't have nothing to do, right. So he was getting into that mode and he was really, really depressed. It got to a point that like food, like it was the even shorter. Like literally he was basically like, no, like, you can't eat that much. Why you eat that much? Like, you’re wasting money, you're wasting this and it was always a struggle. My mom didn't like that either. My mom she suffer a lot with him I say…just just going back you just reminded me like, How does she like deal with it? Right? So when they married, my mom did everything for love. She… She didn't expect anything back. She didn't do anything. Like, she didn't want anything. Like back she didn't want any money. Nothing right. She even signed a prenup for him. So if anything happens like she would never have it, right, that's how much she loved, right? Unfortunately, like we didn't knew about this…because we trusted him. But he did something like inside that… basically said like, you cannot have anything like, like it was it was really bad, that prenup. So we got into the point that my mom was trying to just suck it up just for me. So, she was thinking like Okay, I'm gonna suck it up for a year and then we can stay here, we get the papers and then we can figure out something out. This is for the permanent residence because we apply as a sponsorship.  So he was our sponsor for me and my mom. Yeah. And basically, that's that's what happened, right? So then, it was really, it was really hard like my mom and him they never speak. My mom sometimes had to sleep in floor and had to do some stuff. She was.. she didn't like.. She always… she's she's a happy person, right? So she always go out to, always go out to be like, you know, I'm gonna go out she did. She loved working with kids, so she even volunteered for that. And she'd go out and help kids and everything right? I always go to work, school. I was doing part time, and part time, at the time. And I was really I was doing really good. I was focusing on my studies and I was looking after my work too. I loved it. I was really good in English in Edmonton and I was really surprised. I was like, wow, like, I was like, Wow, really, really good. And that's, for some reason. I was like, wow. In Mexico I was really bad but now in Canada, I'm really good for some reason. What happened? [laughs] you know. But yeah, after that, then he decided to… One month…he was like, kind of, like suspicious kind of away. So he, he was like, basically telling my mom like, threatening her like, you know what, Im gonna cancel the visa, Im going to cancel the papers. We never thought about that. I even told my mom, she would ask me like, can he do it? and I was like, “yes, he can, but I don't think he would. So, one day he comes, and I think ie was like, mostly the economical stress and maybe the depression that he has, because he was looking for a job at that time and he couldn't find it. Like he wanted the same pay and the same things and you would never get something because he didn't have like the diploma. So, like experience unfortunately, doesnt pays you off. That's why I want my papers [laughs]. You know, unfortunately, But yeah, I mean, one day he came in, he just said, so I cancelled the papers. So he didn't even tell us nothing. Apparently, he cancelled it one week before. He was going to the lawyers and he cancelled the whole sponsorship. So he literally went to the thing. And then we've been checked online, we called and they say “yeah, your sponsor just cancelled the application”. So, the case has been closed. So, there's no way that we can help. Because as the rule in Canada once a sponsor cancels, unfortunately, they once they close that file, that’s it. They move to the next one. It is sad. I mean, just like it makes me feel like sometimes they protect more them, their own people than actually us. Right Like as an immigrant…we don't… we didn't came here to do a bad thing. I mean, we were productive. I mean, I was working. My mom was working. My mom…like as a as an accountant, professional accountant, she had to do cleaning floors and everything. Right? We came here we gave everything up from Mexico City just to come here and do all that type of work that we will never came into.. cross our minds, right? So I feel bad about that too for my mom too, because I'm like, all the hard work that you did everything, all the money that you make and everything and it's just for you to start to just working as a cleaning and she was like, I don't care. Like, I'm proud of it. I mean, that's, that's why I love my mom, right like she. Shes just happy. Yeah, so, I mean, and unfortunately, he didn't actually help us out. Because it wasn't like I don't feel like it was like, like he didn't protect us. Like, I feel like in that thing. Canada needs to actually focus on those people too because just by like a snap of a finger, someone just can tell you know, you can go back to your country. \\tSo it was 2015. He cancelled the papers in 2016. So, in November. So it was basically because you need two years of sponsorship and then you get the PR. So he cancelled it after a year yeah, so he cancelled…that's what I mean it's just like doesn't make sense to me …like someone… and then like he was even so funny because even actually bought the tickets because he actually like, kicked us out of the house because…he literally, one day he's like here is tickets from Mexico City. I don't want you in my house. You have a month leave. I already bought the tickets. That's it. So yeah, so that's what I mean when they when they ….they don't realize people ….they don't realize… like how easily someone can just ruin someone's life and then just decide.. just not to do it. Right. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOnce this happened, how did you learn about migration options that were available to you after that? ', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tSo we went to a lawyer.Yeah, for sure. We went to a lawyer because we were scared. We didn't know what to do. And my mom, thankfully, she had, she knew a lot of people at that time. So they connected her to them. And she knew a really good lawyer and thanks for her Thank you her! Like, she actually went for it. So, the funny part about that, the lawyer thing of like, the thing that you asked, it is like the system in here is just, it doesn't make sense. Some lawyers, they just give you they just tell you, okay, you can come here, we will charge you this. And they tell you things that …they're not true. They give you misinformation. Most of the lawyers. Thank god this person my mom know her and she was… she knew a lot of cases so my mom she's really careful with that right so she's like okay so because we try others too and they were like, No. And they basically tell us like… no you have to go to your country. You have no options, you have to go. Like you can apply… you don't know English, they are not going to give you an opportunity… Your age is not going to be enough points to actually work for Express Entry. Right? And for me, they told me Yes, he can do it but he has to go to school. He has to start working and once he starts to work after school, then he can apply. And so me and my mom, we decided like you know what, if that happens, then we started saving money. We started saving money for for my school, and then we start saving money for her too in the future, right? Mostly my mom did it for me, for my school because we knew how expensive is going to be the school. Right? And yeah, like, it's just lawyers in here in Canada, they don't actually help you. And that's one of the main problems I think in everywhere in every province and every city, there's one out of 10… that they actually want to actually help you. And they care about what they're doing. Because most of them, they just want….they just want the money, how we're gonna pay them. And then if it gets accepted, that's good. If it doesn't, next. So, I feel bad because I'm one of the lucky ones at least, I got the good advice from a lawyer. And even though like lawyers are so exhausting, like we have to be in the back of them all the time, because they don't do their work. And that's what I told to my mom, you know what, you were paying her money. You need to actually to… Like the word is not claim. Its like demand… You have to demand her to do her job. It's her job but and you're paying for her. Its not like a free service. If its free, okay, I understand. But, they told us… like we never heard about that option.. the humanitarian option. After we explain our story to the lawyer, she was like, you know what, you qualify for doing a humanitarian visa, as a humanitarian basis and you can apply as a PR. She even told us like, it is rare that these cases, that they get accepted. So, it has to be a really hardship… like a really hardship thing that happened to you that they will accept it. Otherwise, they'll not accept it. So we said right. Yeah so that was by the lawyer.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tIn terms of your family's you said it was you your mom and your brother? Was your brother here during all of this? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tNo, my brother was in Canada before. He was already in Canada. So yeah, he, he he's in a different story… he married. He was in Toronto.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd at what point did you move to Toronto? ', '', '', '', 'Da:\\tWhen he cancelled… when he actually bought the tickets, we actually… that time the time because he gave us like a short time. So we talked to my brother and he offer us to actually live with him. So that was back in 2016. November, December 2016. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd apart from your family, like your close family, your brother, your mom. Any other community that you knew here and they did they were they played any role in this as well. ', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tOh my God. You know, all these communities in here, they're the horrible thing ever [laughs]. They are, I will say in Toronto, they're the laziest person that you will ever met in your life. All community. My mom went to all different type of communities to have some help. And nobody would help her.. like Spanish. Most of them were like Spanish. She asked for legal advice, because she needs to divorce with that guy, right. She asked for legal advice mostly, because she wanted to get the divorce. And even for to ask for the papers and we're doing actually the right thing…the humanitarian basis… they were like No, he's a Canadian, you're an immigrant. You're not gonna get anything, they're not gonna help you out. He has the right. That's basically what we got from a community center where we're supposed to actually help each other. And it makes me mad because he's just they’re people that… they're actually getting paid by the government, that they are not doing their job. They are not actually helping. And it's just, it is unfortunate because I seen it even when I work in the bank. I've been trying to reach this communities to actually help immigrants and me I will myself I want to help them out to do their banking, but they don't.. They just don’t wanna do it. I I really think that community centres, with the government, I think they're stupid, like, I mean, like, I mean, they should not be actually there. I mean, they should not be there. So waste of money. taxpayers money. It is a waste of money. All my friends.. they are immigrants. My friend Kosta, he's from Spain, he went through the same situation, okay. Well, not the same. But he, unfortunately he came when he was 18. So, they didn't give him the papers with his parents. So his parents got Express Entry because they were professionals and everything and they were from the UK. So right away, they get into the permanent residence. But like he was 18, so they didn't give it to him. So unfortunately, no, but we're talking to each other and like, we were mad …we were were even I remember when I was, like, we're even talking about how stupid the system is and how unfortunately for people that like us who actually want to work and want to contribute, and actually not use any of their taxpayer money, which they complain a lot, we actually want to be in this country to work and to do something productive. Unfortunately, they don't give it to us. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tNow you told me the visa processes and everything. You know what we can pretty much move on to the map. One last question before that. In terms of skilled migrant. I mean, like I said that this research is about being skilled or skilled. How do you consider yourself to be skilled?', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tso um, I think for the last two years, I learned a lot in the bank. Even though I don't have a paper that says that I'm a skilled worker, I think I am. I'm a personal banking associate. I deal with a lot of thing… I deal with lots of credits, like credit card applications. I deal with a large amount of money too with clients and I think I'm like my boss loves my job like I think I've given them so well that they're happy with. Like I don't get no complaints from any of my bosses so not my boss. He doesn't have no complaints. I have… I have an attitude problem but that's different case. When he doesn't go my way, I get frustrated.. I get like an attitude problem but I think that’s the sassy part of me. So the most proudest thing than I am is for learning languages. So I learned… in a period of one year I learned French so I'm now with speak French and I speak English and Spanish on the level of a local person. And I'm proud of that too, to be honest. Because I learned it by myself. I didn't learn in school, I just learned by myself and I used to speak with my French clients, they love me too. I always talk to them. They're so nice. And also, I think I one of the main things, I think, and it's, I think it's a skill, because I want to be part of the community to help them. I've been trying to reach for a lot of community centres. I've tried to be part of the LGBTQ community, they’re HIV positive too...some people then to help them out for the banking because a lot of refugees that they come in here, they don't know where to go, and they go in there, and then they help them out. So, I try to help them out here, right. So, I'm being trying to be part of these communities. But for some reason they put so many reviewers, so they don't trust you and they think that they want that you want something out of them. And at the end of the day, I'm like, like I told them… I even tell them I don't get nothing from this. I can give my clients based in there, and that's it, right? Like, I don't need you right there. I don't need to do my work. But I do it because I want to be part of the community, I want to help you guys out. Because I think people are really misinformed. And people are not getting what they actually want to and what they need. So I think that's a skill to I think, like, I learned that I don't want people to go through the same situation with me or my mom, where they just tell you what to do what to do, and they don't have the option. Right? Like, I hate that. Like, it pisses me off if someone tells you like, yeah, you have to do this and this and that. And they don't explain you details. For me, that's, that's like, like, that's disrespectful because it's like you're you're someone your person, and you deserve to actually have options and you deserve to actually be to know what's going on. I mean, it's your money and its your things and you have the full right to actually know everything. So, I always do that to my clients and I try to do that for them. So, I'm proud of that. \", '', '', '', '', '', \"M:\\tso firstly, let's go through all the visa categories you went through from the first point of arrival to the current status, including any wait times, processing times…\", '', '', '', 'Da:\\tYeah, I have to think about, all right. I have So many visas in Canada as I wonder.', '', \"So I think the first one would be my first visa. So I got my student visa first. student visa. so I got my student visa, student visa and that was seen back in 2015. Okay, okay, as a sponsorship. So when you have a sponsorship. When this is the sponsorship, you can get the visas really fast. I got my student visa the time so even though you're under the sponsorship you needed a student visa is …so basically this is not a visa being sponsorship. When you are being sponsored, they give you those visas in order for you to wait to the way to permanent residency. They give you those visas and then after that, then you can work and study whatever. Yeah, so I got the student visa. And that was me before I got I came here. So it took maybe like 3 months period…Give or take. Yeah, when I came here in 2015 when I moved there. So that was the first visa that when I got here. After a year, I was still in the sponsorship thing. So that was in 2015. I'm just saying I'm just wondering because I started working. So I was in school for a year. Yes, those 2016 So, in the gap of the sponsorship, I was still there. I went for a working visa, work visa. But this one, same, you took three months. Like it's a give or take, I think they given to me a little bit faster, because I was in the sponsorship. So when you're in sponsorship, they give you things way faster. Because you like when they have someone that can get in touch you like to be in the back of it. Then it makes it makes the process faster for some reason I don't know why. This was in 2016. I wanted to work. So I was like, you know, what I'm going to work for that time me until I get the PR. So I was thinking that and they say yes, that's…that's a great idea. After that, they just cancel my papers. So, this was in September. When I go my working visa go to the same time, I think August or September. So I got that in August. So this is when I was in the sponsorship. Then this is the sponsorship. Yeah, after the 2016. So when I was in, in December and December, it came here…December November it was time gap I got so my papers got cancelled. But, by the time that work visa was still valid, so I can still use that working visa, no problem. So even if they cancel your sponsorship, the working visa is still valid. So it wasn't it wasn't a problem after that. So December, once it was cancelled, it was fine. It wasn't a big deal. So then we went to the lawyer. And then she started the humanitarian process. They wanted to put that too. Yeah. So all these. So in that time, because we knew that he cancelled he was in November in December. So because its not a visa, so these things …like the sponsorship and the humanitarian, it's a I don't know how to explain it. It is like a process. But it's not an actual visa and it doesn't give you status. It doesn't give you nothing. It's just like, like, you apply for it. That's it, basically. So because basically, they give you your permanent residence as a humanitarian basis, or they give you your permanent resident as sponsorship, or they give you your permanent residence as a work skill as a skilled worker, or an express entrant. So that's how it works. Then I went to the humanitarian and that was in December 2016. That was when the process got started. Yeah, that's like a timeline. And then after that, I got my work permit until (checks phone) So I have the exact dates. And with the humanitarian, you can remain in the country though. That's what they were explaining us, like, as long as you have your working permit, they cant take you out of the country. If you don't have your working permit, then they will ask to leave right away. So, I have this one. They give you a lot of working permits. They ask you a lot of papers like it's because in that process if you like, do you want to know what actually they asked me? My working permit got expired so I had to apply. So, at that time I was working in the butcher shop. So, this time, during the time I will start working in the warehouse and so at this time, I was working in the butcher shop. And then I was working also in the warehouse. So my work permit was perfect and, and everything and… I was afraid because they might not give me my working permit at that time because any of these jobs are not skilled, right? and if they don't accept the humanitarian basis they don’t give you the working permit. You are making me think a lot of things. Coz in that time I got a letter of acceptance. I was still working the butcher shop, but that's fine. Then in 2017 in August, so when I was here… August 2016, I started working at the bank. So my my boss, actually, like, offered me the job. And then I quit that job. And then I stayed in the butcher shop. And then from this one I went to here and then to the bank. It's actually not that bad. And then when I was in the bank in 2017, I actually asked for a work permit. So, they asked me for a lot of things and then they say yes, so in that time, my working permit expired in August and gave it to me because I apply. So it was started working at the bank and then at that time, I have to apply for my my working permit and my working permit. They gave it to me in like after, like after three months, too. So when we knew about the working permit was accepted. We thought that so the lawyer told like if they accept the working permit, it means that they're going to give you the permanent residence, or it means that your humanitarian processes going in a good direction. So I remember I'm not 100% sure, but I remember that in this period of time in 2017. Because this is 2017. So, this is like in January, like in January, sorry. January to May - And then in this period of time, I remember that we got a letter, a letter that said that they will accept the humanitarian basis and that they will and they will actually like go through the process of it, but that doesn't mean that you're accepted. That's what they tell you. So that's, that's the intention of accepting it. Like, we will review this file as a humanitarian basis. But we don't know if you get approved for the permanent resident or as a humanitarian. So we got the letter of of …I will put it like letter accepting, accepting humanitarian…and then after that, yeah, I think that's most of the visas. Yeah, that's all I got. Yeah, it was a student and work visa and then another work visa and then I got another work visa actually action. Okay, so the work visa, because they gave it to me in 2018 because it expired. It was for only one year. So yeah in 2018 of July, so it expire at that time. So in July 2018 yeah because they give it to me for for one year….apply for work permit and it was three months this one.. and it was an open working permit as well.. that’s important. Because they give you restrictions so this one…. that the one that I had for this work visa [before], it only gives you a certain way you can work into certain in a specific places so you cant work everywhere. It gives you restrictions and their conditions in all of the work. And this one was with conditions. And they were saying that I know you can't work at this, we can all look at that. So I got the July 2018 …for the open and they they gave it to me for for two years. For the two years, when I knew about that, even my lawyer told me like you know what, you are going to get accepted for the permanent residence because that's how long it takes for them to give you your permanent residence. And it's true. So my permanent residence I even got it. They give you a PR card. So my PR – I got it on July 2019. So you see, like, it's, it is a whole… I'm sorry, like its a really bad map. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo we'll move on to commercial services that you use, right. So in terms of on your map itself, can you tell me the commercial services, the things that you paid for to get your PR?\", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tSo for that one we didn't pay for the my step… my..my mom's ex husband. He paid I don't know how much to be honest with you…for the sponsorship.\", '', \"Yeah, I have spent a lot of money. Mostly most of it, I would say would be almost like 30,000 for me and my mom. $30,000…that included, that's included the lawyers and I think I would be even more. So sponsorship, you pay for the student visa and my moms working visa. So I'm just gonna put my working visa (mom). Then there is a price as lawyer so…lawyer…that's another expense. What are they actually the charging for that they fix their own fees… I don't know how much you pay ..But like I say I'm pay for lawyers, the student visa and the working visa. So after the sponsorship when I did the humanitarian, we had to give $5,000 just for the application process. So the five thousand dollars he was the application process and that was not guaranteed, right. So it was just to start the process. We had to give the half of it. So one half first. And then the other half when we finish. My mom talked with the lawyers and she said ill pay that. That’s only the lawyers fees .. that’s only for the humanitarian itself, right. So this is only for this kind of thing. But then they charge you for other things, right. They charge you for the working visa for me and my mom, and then they charge you for the translation. So that's all the translation for all the documents like cards, anything that you have any like proof, any school or anything that I think it was least $1,000 coz it was my moms and mine.  I'm not gonna give him like exact numbers, but that's what I think it was the estimate. It really expensive, because they charge you by page. The other thing…the government fees…course because it doesn't come included with the government fees just to apply. They charge you just to put your information in so much then they charge you I think like $300 that is actually expensive because you're going to pay for a working visa, but they will charge you to have a right for visa basically. All right. That's for humanitarian.. I think I paid even more even more for that. Because we moved in here, we have to like pay the like the sending of documents. So when we send the documents the government, we also have to pay for that. So, the shipping of documents. So basically the lawyer will make all your file and everything they will stamp they make everything and then you send it to the government. So it's not online.  So we have to pay for those because they want actual copies of everything. So we have to pay for those shipping documents and makes it expensive because it's important documents… we don't want to make it lost because Canada post is the worst that you will ever have. I will never use Canada Post in my life. So you have to send it by UPS or FedEx basically. I think it's like 75 bucks just for sending documents. when I was in here….in Toronto….Ill say accepted process. I had to pay for my working permit. I also pay for the shipping because I had to send it to my lawyer. This lawyer was based in Edmonton. There's a process online - Yes, but  because this is humanitarian, they have to make the case. So the lawyer makes like a big huge case for you like 20 pages or something like that. And then they explain why you should take care, why are we actually applying. So I did take my medical, medical exams - you have to pay for blood testing and everything. They don't give it to you for free. So, it's blood testing is expensive. Why? I mean, it makes no sense. Then the right right to having this card [PR card]. It was $500. Just to have the right of being a permanent residence, you need to pay 500. They make money. That's why…that's why… I don’t understand because people tell me like “you leave from taxpayers money. Yeah, I wish I could see that money. Where is that money? because I don't I haven't received it yet. What else - fingerprints, prints from Mexico and from here. I have to be that from Mexico and from here so I think for me just to send them to Mexico, it was like hundred. She was like, just to send them and then I have to do the process. It's just too much work that that police think that it was because they want to make sure that they make a background check and everything and then they send it to the country and in the country. They send them to whatever the embassy That's right. So fingerprints, both of them because you have to do it twice…Fingerprints and background check. I think that’s it. I think it's more but I don't remember. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tWe'll move on to the next question. So tell me the role of technology. Did you use technology in your migration journey at all? Did you use any sort of online resources to conduct research on social media? \", '', '', '', \"Da:\\tYeah, I think that we did but it is horrible. Online, the experience is horrible. Our case for some reason it wouldn't show online so we were like in blind form because they don't tell you anything… like normally they say in the website… they say that you can check even on your phone. They give you two options either you go to through phone channel – it takes hours – or online. The problem with online is that our case for some reason in never like…. never like existed in their system for some reason. I don't know why it was just like, wandering around for some reason. So yeah, somewhere. I mean, I hate that online. And I hate the phone chat. I think they're not... When they get them hold of you. They're really nice. And then they give you really good customer service. I have to admit that, but they don't give you no information. They even tell you like we're not gonna give you any information on the trial, you have to wait until actually respond to you, like we're not gonna give you any information at all. The online it gives you a lot of research. But to be honest with you, it's scary to do it by yourself because you can do it you can do the application yourself. Even the government says you can be yourself like you just pay for it and then that's it. But it is a scary because if you miss something, if you use anything, like you say something wrong, or you don't know what actually that question actually means or anything like that - Denied right away and then they give back. So, is it worth it. Might as well just do it the right way and then just from a lawyer, because I see people and I know people that they have actually done it online. They're working permits, they take it online. And they do it by themselves. Like their permanent residence or their working permit. They do it by themselves. So, it's actually interesting because I was like, well, I should have done it, but I feel like it was safer. I'll say….this one none of them work. I hate them. I hate I just hate him like, this is so hard.  So the CIC website - that's one of the main pages and it tells you everything… it gives you. Like, just like, it doesn't give you like an explanation of why you have to do this. I mean, it tells you the time and everything. But it tell them in their own way. Okay, you have to wait this period, this time. But its like, Hey, can I know more? Like what do I have to do with that time? do I have to do anything else or what? So this was like no. My mom did did Facebook. There's like a community for latinos. They they talk about it or something like that. We didn't went through that. I don't think there's that much like online resources.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tTell me about your thoughts on immigration policies on current…Are you kind of on top of it? Do you keep a check on what what immigration is doing? ', '', '', '', \"Da:\\tUnfortunately I dont agree with any of the immigration policies that they have in this country or any where. So it might sound really bad but I think they're not fair…. they're not fair with how they select people and then how they accept people and unfortunately like we live in the world like a lot of people they have to leave their country not because of that’s what they want but because they don’t have another choice because their home it's been bombed or their home is being ….they're being threatened…. their kids are being threatened. And I understand that. I completely understand that. I mean, I think…I think that…for instance, I do not agree about the refugee stand for the Syria. Okay so the reason why is because the way they treat other people way better than us.. the actual immigrants, right? Basically, what the government is trying to make me understand is like so if youre actually having all this trouble and everything will give you everything. They give him the housing, they give them clothes, they give them all these resources to help them out to go through this life in Canada. Whereas the other parts ….where ‘us’ when I go into this category – Its like “no we don’t care, you need to pay and you have to figure out a way”. So, like in my my case, and a lot of people that I know… it's just not… I don't have nothing against their country or anything. It's everything like that…they can have everything so easy in the silver plate, but they don't realize how fortunate they are. is not the fact I understand completely. It's not a fact, I completely agree. They should actually give more help to them. And we should support. It doesn't make sense that you're helping all these other people and then just forget about the people that actually are contributing to your economy and are giving you money for that and we're not using any taxpayers money, or any we're not using any money or resources from any of the government. And at the end of the day, they really treat us like, like, “Okay, thank you. Thank you for coming”, you know. I even even see skilled workers, all the things that they have to go through, all the money that they have to pay. My friends, I’ve seen them - the scare of actually going back to your country because you don't actually perform in this country because they will you know, they see no, you can stay here because you don't qualify for it. I'm like, I'm thinking to myself like it is… like, how I'm not qualifying for it?, Like explain to me, how im not ‘qualifying’ for having to live in this country? I pay my taxes. I've been here for a long time and being a contributor for this society. I think and being part of here. I mean, it's not fair that you give priority to other people, just because your government and the choice of the people decided to do that. This is not even their fault. I'm not saying it's their fault. There's nothing to do with that. I mean, a lot of people they might thim im really.. a lot of people might not like my way of viewing things but its just like…its not fair to the person that he has worked so hard and then people like that the people like this… they going through that situation as a refugee, they don't appreciate what they really have. Sometimes its stupid… sometimes people like, they think they deserve everything in a way that and they show it to us like no I just. I'm not gonna work. I already have this. I have that… and I'm like that must be nice. I mean, like the refugees… they got greeted by the Prime Minister,they gave them clothes and everything - I didn't get anything. I didn't get any clothes. I have to buy my own. I didn't get any money. I have to actually pay taxes. I didn't receive any money back. I earned a lot of money for the government, just because I was working two jobs. Which makes no sense. I was like, in makes really no sense. Like how the government is actually doing this. Like, so what are you saying? Like, okay, so you have to work so hard to be in this country. You need to pay your lawyer. You need to pay your housing. Rent is not cheap here. You need to pay for your food. You need to pay for your normal expenses. And if it's something left to have a little bit treat for yourself, then you can have it. But then you see other people that they use the system. And I’ve seen it for long and I'm not saying it's only Syrian people. A lot of South American people do the same thing. And it's just so frustrating and its so, so like, like, it's just it makes me so mad. Because it's like, you have no idea what you have. Like they're giving you the opportunity, take it. Not everyone gets that opportunity. And that's what a lot of people don't understand. You know how many people actually want to be in a place where people are actually suffering back in their own back in their country, who are actually having a struggle. And then they come here, and they don't do anything. That makes me mad, because, at least at least in here, and what I have to say for myself is like, this space haven't been, it wasn't easy. At least I'm proud to say like, you know what, I'm a Mexican. And I came here to actually do something with my life and I actually work and I contribute to the economy. I am proud to be in this community and whoever told the opposite, that would be like no.. I do the same things as you. Because I see it with my partner. He's Canadian. So he has that conservative mentality that immigrants take everything.  Well, my ex partner… we just recently broke up. It's just because most of the people they say the same things. The same old comments that immigrants are taking their jobs or taking their, their opportunities, they're taking their money. And I'm like thinking like, No, that's not true.

So now just need only two years for citizenship. Which makes no sense. So I mean, like, I've been here four years in this country, you can't give me my citizenship right now?

And actually, they deserve to be here, and they actually want to have people there. Because it's not… like I like I keep saying it's not fair. And they give opportunity to other people that they should not be here. For instance, they should not take everyone.. you know what I mean? I think it and it's not about their background is not about their religion, it's not about anything. It's like they if you don't want to be part of this community are you doing here? If you don't want to get used to this culture, you don't want to be part of this culture. What are you doing here because culture is one of the main things and one of the main things that my mom and her ex-husband told me is like, you’re coming here, you change your culture. You're not Mexican, you're not. You're a Canadian. You're not celebrating any Mexican culture. You're not going to celebrate anything like that because you're in Canada. You're not in Mexico.

And of course, I don't wanna, if im in Mexico, I don’t wanna celebrate Canadian holidays, right? It makes sense. I was like, Yeah, but unfortunately, a lot of people they don't like… they don't get that. They want to change the culture here. Which I don't agree with it because it's not..

A lot of people they helped me with this and it's people that they're my clients people that they’re still my clients. I think I got maybe…. they don't give you an estimate of how much you need to help…. but the lawyer says that the many you get the better right because them…. for the government it says like you were part of the community and then they know you. They know you. And I got so many beautiful letters from people that I just met …just one day and I asked for a letter and they say yes, like So nice people like I mean, and they're all from here, from Cabbagetown. I mean, a lot of people they say they say, it might sound stupid, maybe because it's just a letter. But it just opens your eyes. Right? Like, I mean, I'll show you one it's, it's, it's just beautiful. How people are. I just love… I love that's the whole reason why I love customer service because this is it gives you a better understanding of people. Right? So this is one of my my clients from the butcher shop. I just talked to… She's so nice, and she gave me this amazing letter. And it's just beautiful. How actually people express about you just by knowing you for a little while. I love it. I have more. They did handwritten letters too. It's just beautiful. How many people they actually open their, their way and they see something because that's what they told me is like, you know what, I see something for me, and then I see that you are going to be great in this country and then you deserve to be in this country. I'm like, thank you. So they asked you for banking statements. So for the humanitarian base, they asked me for the all your banking statements so basically all your banking history….you have you had a credit card, and your personal banking because you need to prove how you been paid. How you pay your credit cards. How many loans you have, taxes – that’s the most important thing. How do you pay your taxes? and it has to be every year so every year, But I will put you in there like this is the most important thing for me was the letters. Yeah, letters, I think. I think it opens the eyes. It makes the officer making the application makes understanding of who you are, right. I got letters from restaurants or letters from people, we got letters from from …from my My brother's bosses. I go letters from my bosses and hearing the bank to say yes for sure I'll write a letter for you. I don't mind. Its so nice right? I can't I just can't believe I went through that was just like it is it is a hard process. Like sometimes I like I told you right in the beginning, like I feel like if I would have stayed in Mexico, like I told you, if I would have known all of this, I wouldn’t have come.  I'm not gonna say this. I think it's like all the experience that I have in here and made me learn a lot of things. I think I'm more mature and a lot of things. I got a good job. I got a lot of people that help me support me and then being together with me how I got closer with my family even closer with my mom and closer with my brother. It feels great. I mean, I don't think I would have done this things in Mexico. I think it would have been different. I would have been in school right now. I think I would have done just the same just because I wanted to Mexico. When I was talking with my friends in Mexico, what have they done and everything. And theyre still in University, right, they starting and everything I'm like, I would love to actually be in there. You know, I wouldn't love to just feel that. I feel like when I came here in this country, make me to Miss A lot of things like school .. who doesn't want to go to university? Who doesn't want to interact with people your age, to have the same thinking to actually, like express different ideas with each other? Right? So I think I missed that I miss and I would have loved to have that opportunity to actually interact with people who are my around my age. And it's hard You know what I mean?

So you got married but were ', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tYeah I definitely was looking out to move out of Pakistan because, where I was staying, in Pakistan what tends to happen is that you have a very limited skillset and people tend to have a very narrow notion about what you can do with your skills and what you can. And I feel I was always looking to move out of that sphere and get into a sphere where I could start over new and my past didn't really matter in terms of career and all that stuff. So I could study or I could go back and say go back to school, I could start working. I could start like becoming an entrepreneur. But my my, like what my motivation always was, was because I was so attached to Pakistan in terms of the not for profit and humanitarian work that I did in Pakistan. I always wanted to, even if I moved anywhere else, I always wanted to carry that goal in my head. So say you know whether I moved to like England or Canada or America I always wanted to sort of ignite this sort of, you know, passion and say maybe overseas Pakistanis or just other people about like arts and crafts in Pakistan and how much potential there is and how much like they're being exploited and how much so my connection was always like, I'll move out Yes, and I'll have like a primary day job or whatever, but I really want to sit down and like sort of promote our arts and like our crafts all over Pakistan… and our music and like everything because it's so rich culture. And in Pakistan, like stuff like Urdu’s wearing out. People don't talk Urdu as much. I and, you know, I mean, that's, that's the language to be proud of. Because honestly, like, I mean, unfortunately, even I can like sort of understand, like, very poetic Urdu because I haven't been brought up there, but I wish I could and I wish I could take pride in it because the kind of like linguistic like it's just everything. I think everything's from like authors like Manto to like poets like Faiz, like, Pakistani art like Sadeqain or so whatever you have, like they have so much more like struggle in their like in their Arts then. Well, it's wrong to make a comparison but I feel like there's so much struggle because it seemed very, very hard lives in that they’ve seen like partition they've seen like, the whole Bangladesh like, you know, \\\\ they’ve seen just a lot of fractions of life that maybe haven't and then our youth are not sort of. They're not. They're not informed about that as they should be. And I feel like wherever I wanted to go in life, I always wanted to inform people of my culture, whether they were Pakistani or not. So yeah, that's something that I always wanted to bring into. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tRight. So you like, I mean, tell me about your background. So you grew up outside of Pakistan? ', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tSo I was born in Islamabad. So my dad was a diplomat. After every two foreign postings he would have to come back to Islamabad to work at the Foreign Office. I was in Islamabad. When I was 2 I moved to Baghdad for about five years in Iraq and then then I moved to Indonesia for about three years. Then back to Islamabad when I was about seven, eight, and I went to school in Islamabad so this is my first sort of thing with with Pakistan. But Islamabad is very different culturally from Pakistan, from Karachi because there's a lot of foreign population like theres diplomats and stuff. So you don't really feel the typical-ness. You know, it's not claustrophobic, it's, it's a little more broad. And then after Pakistan, we moved to the Netherlands for about six years. I think that was my dad's longest posting and that was kind of like, has in a way become home for all of us in some way or the other and then after the Netherlands, I moved to Russia. So I was living in Moscow for about three years. My dad retired some time in February 2008. I was still in the middle of high school, I was doing my International Baccalaureate, and then so I obviously could not it was like, couple of months ago, my final exams I was seeking move back to Pakistan with them. So I stayed on in Russia all alone. And that was a lot of fun. But apart from that, like I learned about, like, what the Russian culture and about so many things and about just just how like, you know, and I remember ever since I was like, you know, 10- 11 I would just go on and on about Pakistan to my friends and how amazing the culture is I was just one of those like, you know, it's very proud of all of these things and, and people just like my wedding happened in December, and all my friends were like you've been raving about Pakistan for like, as long as we've known you. Like, we're so excited to come. They all, well, some of them came and, like, you know, it was nice. So, then I moved to London to do my law at UCL and then I thought I didn't want to do my bar, whatever I came back to Pakistan. And yeah the story starts from there in terms of work and then finding like, what I'm good at what I what my passions are, like, you know, all that kind of stuff. And it was very difficult sort of moving a step forward, because they're like, but your lawyer, why wouldnt you want to practice law? Why would you want to do this? Why would you want to do that? So So we actually did, like a couple of friends. We actually close… but honestly when I practice law, my my impetus was not to become like a corporate lawyer or like whatever you see in suits or whatever and all of that stuff and makes shit loads of money. It was…it was more like, I wanna work. So criminal law I want to do Human Rights, that's where I was heading towards. And both things in Pakistan are a challenge because a woman being a criminal lawyer, anyone being a criminal lawyer and most of the criminals are very sort of notorious. And you know, I started I remember I started visiting kurachi Central Jail quite a few times to get an idea to get people's stories because I liked writing also, I like writing also, and I remember getting calls and getting tracked and all of that kind of stuff. So that was, you know, just a little uncomfortable. So basically that happened then and then we like couple of our friends were like very passionate and stuff. We, together with the guidance of Asma Jahangir, she's she's a very well known like activist add lawyer in Pakistan. So we started this legal aid clinic, whereby we would work with people who could not afford Legal Assistance which is 70% of the population. So you know if there was like land crimes and you know people taking over their property or people taking the land or people taking over whatever… like whatever is domestic violence or domestic divorce, the husband not giving the divorce, whatever it was, we were kind of solving it and than unfortunately I got a job into another good corporation which was linked law remotely and so I said okay, why not? But I kept in touch with the legal aid clinic and I believe it's doing really well right now. It's it's like when we started we were like, like working from like, what like, basically just like someone was kind enough to give a room from their house, like, somewhere in Lyari, right which is a very…was a criminal infested area. But then, now I believe it has its own office and all of that stuff so it is picking up. I would love to do that kind of thing in Pakistan but unfortunately like, you know, there's implications to that. Yeah as there is anything that's a little out of, you know, boundaries or whatever. And there are a lot of boundaries. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo tell me about your your marriage so I mean your wedding. How did you meet your husband?

But then like a friend of mine, and friend of his suggested that we…like we should probably like, get to know each other and it was a mutual friend of ours whose wedding it was. And so, he introduced us and then you know, one thing led to another we started sort of like, this is December 2015. And he was only there in Pakistan for a holiday and I don't know what happened to me but I just took… I'm very careful about these things but I just took a leap of faith and then we started having a long distance relationship. I told him that like, the only the only way I'm gonna have a long distance relationship with you is if we make an effort to meet after three, four months whether that's, you know, Im not asking you to come all the way to Pakistan or I'm not going to come all the way to Canada but lets meet half way. Otherwise not going to work on the phone and all that stuff. So we try to make an effort to that consistently as possible. Year and a half into it, he wanted me my family. I met his and then from then on. We kind of like, sort of… Oh, we met like in our first holiday was in Lisbon that we went to Miami. We went to Barcelona, so, and he came to … he comes to Karachi every December. So that, and then San Francisco. So like just random places, right?

But in hindsight, I probably had a better option going North America, or Canada do my law, but I believe it was I just wanted to get it done. I was not a very studious student in any case, so I was sort of like, okay, so we get it done three years done. With America, like or whatever you'd have to do like pre law then. You know, but like being in America would have definitely been a more wholesome experience. Yeah, but but London is fabulous. Great place. You know, at the time, it's funny because right now, couple weeks ago, I read that they changed the law… and the students who graduate from… foreigners who graduate from English universities have a 2 year to find work and whatever. At that time we didn't have that. And with Law, it was a very, like Oxford, Cambridge, very strict, aristocratic, sort of, selection process where the top law firms had people were graduates from there. And obviously people who are not of my racial ethnicity, if you could say that, so that was very competitive.

I don't want to do anything really, because it really does take away from who I am. I'd either go back into the Arts somewhere or the other, do something with writing, if that was… if I were to follow my passion.

I don't know why that is but that's probably a good a good thing I guess? I don't know, or maybe people over here just more into like finance and marketing. And that's what I tend to sort of hear every time. So when someone says I have a job, they're like, Oh, well I work for a bank for we work for, you know, whatever a company like Lowe's or you know, retail and that kind of stuff. So maybe that job market isnt built or maybe it'll be funny that way. But it hasn't been like hugely competitive to get a couple of interviews here and there.

And then working that around, and talking with people talking to different lawyers, and then coming up and saying, well, no matter what you can be an inbound applicant. So that was a very stressful procedure, especially for my parents as well, because they just didn't think they just couldn't imagine like, and then it was also stressful for me because I was like, So where am I gonna live? Am I gonna live in your house, your parents? Or am I going to live with my own family? Coz it makes no sense to live in your house and blah, blah, blah, like that, obviously, raised a lot of conflict, and because of conflict and pressure was there I think we moved on.

But um, what about your husband like, is he very culturally Pakistani, or is his family very culturally Pakistani?\", '', '', '', \"Su:\\tHis family, I would say are very traditional but Modern Family. So he is not he's traditional in the sense like, now, that I'm living with him I get to know how traditional he is. But he's not like every time like say for example if you go out for dinner with a couple of people and they're not they're from Canada or whatever and someone asks how’s Pakistan and I'd be like Pakistan’s great like there's so much…you go up north, there mountains… you go south theres the sea. And he… hes just like Pakistan’s shit, like, wow that's one thing we clash on. Im like Amir, look like we have so many like there's so much culture like you know whether it comes to food or comes to traditions or folklore or whatever. He's not very proud Paksitani.  In the sense of gender roles and stuff, he's very typical but when it comes down to,\", '', \"say like, he's not worried about what I wear, what I do. He's not like in traditional the sense that like, he has set of values and like systems that are… that go beyond superficial things like clothing and all of that it's all about you know, well did you… you know, take care of somebody? Are you hospitable? These are the things that I think comes from our culture because we as people are very hospitable. And we take care of our guests and he's always told me like I'm a hospitable as well, but he's always told me like, you know, guests whoever comes to our house…like that way you can tell the traditionalism coming in but and also the fact that when we started dating, he wasn't like he told me from the first day I'm not fooling around with you like if this works out. I want to get married to you. And I was like, okay, because guys, even in Pakistan dont say that. So that in that sense yes, I'd say he’s well valued but but but not like, you know, very pro Pakistan. Or maybe he just doesn't know it. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, so we'll, we'll get drawing. So, the first question is, tell me about all of the visa categories you went through from the point of your initial arrival to current status. Now, in terms of your journey, I would also be interested in your…Was it a student visa to do the UK? So probably that as well. Went to the UK, you went back to Pakistan. Maybe you want to demonstrate that you were growing up in other parts of the world. It's totally up to you, but like basically all kinds of visa categories that you went through a journey or..journey around the world.\", '', '', '', \"Su:\\tIm very artsy, so I'm gonna try and do something artsy. I think I'm more in the moment kind of person. So that’s a Pakistani flag. So it says 20th December 1989 the day this is the day I was born. I was born and this is the day that my dad was he was going through a lot of politics in terms of people and his colleagues. So he was fighting for a promotion that he was very much due for. But this day, the day of my birth, I was born as finally when he got that promotion, making him like the ambassador, like in foreign countries. So he always sees my birth as good luck. I've always been like a little spoiled dads child. So moving on from that, like if I were to go on…I wish I knew what the Arab flag looked like. This is Iraq. This is Indonesia. So my first best friend was I met… was in Indonesia. So then, leaving was sad obviously. Then we went to Islamabad which was interesting. So, we stayed like random places. Well, when my dad was doing a course and we stayed in one of those houses too long…Like, our like, container came by a container came from from Jakarta. And then we bought a house and my dad was busy like doing these courses and my mom us were like, just. like first experience in Pakistan like, our maid, like goes missing and my mom was like, but I dropped her home, like last night and she told me this is the house and like the next day the family comes to the house and they're like, like what did you do to like my daughter? She's not back home, whatever and they threatened to put it up in the newspaper or whatever. Turns out the girl herself had ran away with another guy. So that was like, obviously all this visa stuff was supported by my dad. So I don’t really know much about it. So there was this holiday without mom. It was amazing. No with dad was amazing. Yeah, mom was …all these rules back then obviously right. I remember the flag. So That's Holland, that's like legal.. like that’s weed, so Canada. Yeah its way more legal here than in Holland. There you can't smoke on the streets. Over here, like there's no, like you can order it online on the Government of Ontario Canada website…like they even have like CBD oils and stuff like that which you can tell me which which ones are good so. To be honest I'm not like so much as so much a weed person I realized so yeah i think i think i think… or maybe the strains that I've like ordered haven't been like very suitable for me but like in Pakistan whatever I used to get like cuz I love writing so get me very creative. Over here, it just gets me very like paranoid and jittery and I don't like that.  So, well I was a little upset and I think I spoke for all my family when I say this that like this is you know, home. We did there for so many years and moving from Holland to like, say like, you think about like Russia, you're like, what the hell… Where am I going? But then you know, we get there and like, you know, It's amazing. Like it's just the best. I speak Dutch but now that's going down the drain obviously because I have less people to practice with but. Im trying to draw this but its not working…St. Basil's Cathedral basically. Yeah. And the Kremlin, but I'm not I can't draw them. And then funnily enough their flag is the opposite of…So all of this was like diplomatic visa. My father retired in 2008. I'm not gonna go into the English flag cuz, yeah, England..whatever. I was living in London. It was nice. I had a lot of friends at that point who had also moved to London. So it's kind of like interesting because you know, I had a community. Its like those weighs – like justice or whatever. So this is the artist that I work with. Obviously, she doesn't look like that. But just to signify that I was curating in some point in my life. So I got a very serious or, I thought was a serious relationship in my second year like while I was in Pakistan, got my heart broken. I thought it was the end of the world but it clearly wasn't. There are many more heartbreaks after that and many more like fun times. And then we have in the middle, I think, the most important one. Like I know that’s not a maple leaf but like, Ironic, right, because I was born on 28th December. I got married on the 23rd of December. So [moving to Canada], It was a struggle. The weather was a struggle, there was loss of relationship excitement, like I said, husband traveling a lot, not ready to let go of his bachelor lifestyle habits. Now it's gone better because lot of people told him to but initially No. And then I used to be stuck in upset because I but now I found my own thing and I found my way to go through with him and how to deal with him. I know what he's tired when he wants to watch a match, when he does these things I know like the whole rhythm. So I'm not very like pushed about it. But yeah, that's, that's well, that's my very basic map, I guess. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo I suppose I'm what I'm now interested in is you're, you're like the kinds of services that you uses. I mean, this is research is also about what people do in turn. of trying to get visas. Yeah, so I suppose the two destinations that I'm interested in knowing about is London is the UK and Canada. And you said that you used a lawyer for Canada. so I mean what I'm wanting to know as any commercial services that you used okay things that you paid for all you guys had to pay for \", '', '', '', 'Su:\\tlawyer for Spousal Visa …a lot of money and then obviously there was the visa for the visa which obviously is like a visa fee. right. So that for the UK that was also student visa. Had a fee but I didn’t use a lawyer coz obviously university on my behalf had actually, and honestly, the at that point, there was a big clunk of students, in the sense that there was like you know that year… there was a big backlog and whatever people got their UK visas really late so I did miss like freshers week and stuff. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd there was University fees and like how what what sort of support systems that were available to you mean where your foot where your family paying the fees? Yeah, yeah, I was. I used to come back to Karachi, like the summer and work, like, just like gaining experience, but it was mostly like my family paying for it. ', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tSo for immigration here I had to do criminal record check. I had to do medical. I think I still have to do a few more things like to prove you know, we're married. The other day, we got a letter from a lawyer from who had gotten a letter from, from the Canadian government saying that we need to prove that we're cohabiting. Im like how do we prove that they're like. Well, basically, you know, joint bank accounts or letters that have come to your house, like addressed to you, but come to his address and that kind of stuff. I was like, Okay, fine. We'll send that over. But like, obviously, I mean, I get it, I get it from their point of view, because there's a lot of people that just get married, like, sort of have an agreement whereby they're just like, okay, I'll get married to but you know, I'm just helping you with your residency or whatever. But yes, but we gave them a lot of proof of the fact that like, I remember my husband writing like four pages of like, how we met, how this happened. Even then they had like questions like, Okay, what was the restaurant where the first date was? What was this? What was that? So they were very thorough and so despite that, like im quite surprised  they still think someone would’ve made that up, but maybe it's maybe it's just protocol? I don't know. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd I mean, how do you also look? I mean, I suppose now I'm just gonna ask you a moral sort of an emotional question or Yeah, mental kind of a question where How do you feel about being on this dependent visa? I mean, considering that your visa depends upon your husband and marriage?\", '', '', '', \"Su:\\tIt's stressful? Yeah, very stressful. Like, I can't wait to reach to the mark where, like, you know, I'm on my own kind of thing and like, it's not dependent, like, in any way, like, you know, it's a very insecure time, you know, like your dependence is completely on somebody else. Financially also, and as well as, you know, country wise or living wise. That's never ever happened with me. So, I think that that is a that's a tough like. These are tough emotions to juggle sometimes. I've always been this kind of like independent person and then you turn around you suddenly become utterly dependent on someone else. Its like ha ha, joke's on you, kind of thing. Well, I think the first few months like you were kind of like, okay, let's just go with however it is. Yeah, he was a bachelor. So he was like, Okay, we'll buy groceries whenever and neither was really cared. But because I was like, I was so used to a house that was systematic and he was so used to living as a bachelor, that I wanted systems like groceries every two weeks, I wanted to cook coz I like cooking like, I wanna have meals ready, and like stuff like that. So, those are the things I had to like systemize and then obviously, like, anything I needed to get or whatever, like, although, like I try very hard to like pull out my savings or whatever and do part time jobs here and there. Obviously he still supports like, like, anything that I need, right? Like, you know, like give me a certain amount of whatever it is so that I can buy this or that.. So even though like I would not be on this way, I wouldn't be on the street anyway. But like, it's just one of those things where you're like, I'd rather know when this is happening and when it's going to be fine, like, as opposed to be like in the dark because I don't like uncertainty. That’s it. And it's also, I’ll tell you what, I've never lived in a country as an immigrant. I've always lived and my dad used to always say this, and Im like dad “That's such a wrong thing to say”… like don't use the word “immigrant” in the negative connotation, but he's like, I'm right. You realize that when you move there, that in your life you did have like a privileged status, whether you liked it or not, and then in Pakistan you lived at home. Now suddenly, you're basically like, gonna be a barista at Starbucks, you're gonna have problems getting your mind down, right? Rather than thinking I'm still living in that sphere of mind. For me. That's, that was the biggest challenge to overcome. And I think I've overcome that really, but like it's still every day, it's like, okay, you're not starting from if you were at level 10 in Pakistan, you're not starting from level 10, you probably started with level two. Yeah. And that is sort of, it hits your self esteem, it hits your dynamics with your husband or whatever, because, you know, like, it just does, like, even indirectly, its got nothing to do with anyone else. But it's just like that. And I have been financially like, I lived with my parents, whatever. So as far as like bills and stuff goes, I had like no idea… but in terms of like my own financial stuff, like things I wanted to buy or the things I wanted to do, I never asked my parents. So it's it's challenging because I've been like, not that I have to ask my husband for money. He will just like transfer it every month or whatever but, but you know getting there it takes time to get there because it's awkward. You're like, he's my boyfriend you're dating, everything's fun suddenly it comes down to money. And then when I researched it was like, a big like a big issue between couples and I was like, okay, there's the other issue I remember we were joking about this when we were dating was like two two big issues in a marriage. And then one is cleanliness and I remember dating sitting there laughing and saying what do you mean cleanliness? How is that even an issue that leads to divorce or whatever. And and he was like, I don't know, I'm just reading this off a website and the second one is budgeting. And I was like oh Don't worry, we won't have issue with either but like I here now and I have issues with both [laughs]. My husbands not the most cleanest person… he's clean but he's messy. Yeah, he's hygienic. You know, he's he's like, Okay throw the shoes here, the socks here.  And the the thing is it's so funny because I was living at home I didn't really care like I kept my room like clean or whatever but like I wouldn't have cared if someone came to my house and put their boots here or there but now I'm just like “tomorrow I'm gonna wake up I know I have to do it”. So like it just gets me antsy and irritated. And obviously factors like that wouldn't be there if I was like working safe say, if I work from like nine to like six seven, I wouldn’t give a shit about like what's happening like…That's also one of the things I that's why I want to get to work so fast although could take a longer sabbatical, and do part time gigs, but I think one of the reasons for mental stability will also be getting back to work. An idle mind is the devil's workshop this basically it. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd in terms of like these part time gigs that you're doing, what are you doing? \", '', '', '', \"Su:\\tMostly like brand ambassadors stuff. So right now working for this thing called, there's a magazine called refinery 29. But we know it like they're they're doing these pop ups all over this a fourth year doing these art installations. What it is, is like an experience-based thing. So like they're curating 29 rooms with different experiences for people go there. So, there's like artists, they've been doing this in Florida, Atlanta, and like, a couple of places, and this is the first time they doing in Toronto at the exhibition place. So they’ve picked all Canadian local artists, and they're doing like very like performance art. And it's very interactive. So if you're like a visitor and you bought a ticket, you're not just standing here looking at the museum, but you're interacting with the Art. And so I'm just like, working.. I don't know exactly what my role is till the training is tomorrow, but I'm gonna be like one of their brand ambassadors. Probably make contacts and stuff during that time. But, yeah, it's like 12 hours a day work, but I think I need that. Like, honestly networking, you know, it's like, it's weird because it's not difficult. It's actually one of the easier countries to network. But I just feel like because of the closeted environment that we actually experienced in Paksitan where a girl goes up to a guy like gives out like a visitor cards, like “oh, okay, you know”, so that I think that's kind of been drilled into our like, my system. So like, the whole networking thing is like, like my parents. They’re like “what's networking?...just like send CV’s” Im like dad these guys like networking… it is 80% of the job. The other day I went to this NGOs random like annual general meeting and my husband was like why are you going to the annual general meeting? so random…I was like I'm going to go and try making contacts. After the meeting was done I walked up the CEO and I'm like, Look, I like to introduce myself very briefly coz she obviously didn’t have time. She's like, Look, let me just give you my card and email me and we'll see what positions we have and where we can put you for that was like, you know, like a step to get out. But I think most of the time I'm so stuck in my comfort zone. It's a lot of laziness and like it's, kind of like futility and actions like… Okay, so what if I get this I'm never gonna be as senior as big as I was in Pakistan. So like, I'm gonna have to work what 10 years more to get the level that I was in Pakistan. Its ridiculous. Even though that may not be the truth. But I don't you know, that's what I mean. That self defeating thought kind of puts me back on doing stuff. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd in terms of your migration itself was tell me the role of your parents and your social connections. So friends, family community that they played in your migration, or was there? Was there any role in there? ', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tYeah In terms of authenticating that, Oh, yeah. You know, our daughter, was in a relationship with him and they were dating and then she got married and that kind of thing, but otherwise not really. My mom kind of knew, like I told her first because we had… my cousin was getting married in San Francisco, and he was just insisting on meeting my family, and he was my mom's brother's daughters wedding, so my first cousin. And so I said, Okay, fine. You want to move my family from San Francisco and he'd come and then from then on, it was like, no going back kind of thing. But he met my dad like later that year. So Ive never like introduced any guys to my dad, unless the guy has been serious about his intentions and he was very serious about it. So, I guess that was that was that. In terms of dating and stuff, so like my mom would know… But like, I never liked sort of introduced them to my dad, so then he was like okay that's the real deal, you know. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd in terms of the…are you are you sort of interested in immigration policies and migration policies generally?', '', '', '', \"Su:\\tFor sure.

It's just about like, if, if I've just flown in or whatever, from Tunisia or wherever, I didn't speak a word of English and whatever, like, how can you help me in the immediate level to get me assimilated to my culture, to make sure that I live in a place which has people from my culture, like I've always been interested in, like, migration and like, settlement and, and immigration and just general sort of like, you know, cultural assimilation, and I feel there's a big lacking of that, no matter how many centers they have. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tRight.

And I'm like, okay I need to know what's going on or like sports for that matter, and that kind of stuff. So I was never very like… London's different because I was more politically aware because it's more globalised.  But in terms of use of technology to help me out Absolutely not. I just didnt. I think every big change in my life has been blindness and aloofness. If I were to put it that way, every single decision that I have made has been just on, you know, just just a leap of faith like really… Ive never really been like, Okay, I'm gonna research this or whatever it's been like someone's given me advice. I like the advice, Ill go for it or whatever. But now like, as I've grown up and realized several mistakes I might have made doing that, I try to remain more informed and I try to research more. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tBut yeah, maintaining your relationship with your boyfriend or your husband now.

So, both of these things have helped me a lot …eating clean, organic and also like a lot of lateral movement therapy essential oils and just tinctures and whatever it is like I've benefited from them a lot. So I really want to do something that would help other people also do that. I want to link that to mental health somehow. So I've been reading up a lot about mental health and about, you know, different therapy procedures and how to do that. I'm not a certified therapist so obviously no one can take me seriously in that way. So basically that’s also something I want to do, but I also like I think my main goal in life in whatever factor would be to help people, whether that's mental health or that's, you know physical disabilities or volunteering at you know, an old people's home because I know I just had this certain like, obviously, I've never been old before and I've never felt the feeling of loneliness of not having my children because I don't have children but there's something that pulls me to connect to people. Whether they're orphans or old people, so there's anything I can do for them in any way id be grateful.

I'm just like, just relax and enjoy the moment. Like, I'm not I'm not worried if I don't have a house. Kids are not my agenda anytime soon. But I'd like to have then for sure.

You were dating,\", '', '', '', 'Me:\\tYeah, yeah, before the wedding too, I think every every month because he was able to come to Chicago and from Chicago, he would come to Houston. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tRight. Okay. So you did it for a year and a half, and then you got married, and then two years after you moved here. Okay. Great. Awesome. That's a really good story. And tell me about your background. So you're from Pakistan originally. And your husband's from Pakistan?\", '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYes. Yeah. He's from Pakistan. I'm from Pakistan. And I'm from Hyderabad. Sind. there is a small town, village called Tando Yousuf. so I'm from there. I've seven, six siblings other than me so we are seven all together. And yeah, I moved to America in 1987. When I was 20 years old, I got married and once I that was my first marriage. So once I got married after a week, I just moved to America - Seattle, Washington. And then from there, we moved to Huston from Chicago, Chicago to Houston and then I lived in Houston for about I would say Jami is 31 now, so probably, yeah, until 2016.\", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\t Okay, and how many children so you said you have two? Yes. ', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYes. So I have Jami, who's 31 and then Naz, my daughter. She's 28. she's in DC she's working on so Okay, great. She is the consultant as well. And Jamal is also. So she she lives in DC and Jamal lives in Chicago. And then my my siblings live in Texas, San Antonio and Houston. all my six siblings are here in US - most of them are in Texas. One is in Virginia.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tRight. And your husband's kids, are they with you? There are moved out as well. \", '', '', '', \"Me:\\tWhen I moved here - 2016 – two of his kids were living with us. And they are older. His oldest son. He is 28 Yeah. Then he had a daughter was 24. Yeah. No, another son who's 24 and then a daughter was 25. Yeah, so our kids are kind of like the same. We have a new Brady Bunch. Desi Brady Bunch. So two of them were living with us, his oldest son and his daughter was living with us at that time. They just moved out this year.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOh, wait. Okay, cool. Awesome. And can you tell me a little bit about your sort of considerations to move to Canada? Was it ever? Was it ever a choice between that you will ask him to move to the US? Or he will ask or you will definitely have to move to Canada. Was there ever a discussion about that?', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYes, there was a dispute. He actually wanted to live in US. But his circumstances were a little different and difficult for him because his parents are living here. So he's won. His father just passed away this year. Yeah. He was 86 years old. So and then his mother's at 86 as well. And and she well know his mother's 88 years mother's age. So she's still with us.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay. She lives with you.', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYeah. lives with me. And so for him, it would it was hard for him to move there. Because..because of the healthcare. His sister lives here, but she wouldn't have able to take care of them by herself. So, I moved here left my job. I was working for 22 years. Yeah. And yeah. So that was understood that he wouldn’t move.  And how was that for your family like your children as well or your other family that you were deciding to move? What role did they have to play that this.. Yeah, it was. It was very interesting. My kids, even though they are older, and they were the one who pushed me to get married because they moved out. You know I was living on my own and the cat, and you know us didn't have every time tornado or hurricane come you know they are more worried about me so they were pushing me “No mom you need to get married and it was funny because I would say between all three of us Let's see who will get married first” laughs. It would be like you know somebody would say, you know, you should think about yourself you know your kids will find somebody but you need to think about it then I was thinking okay, you know, I need to find people and you know that butterflies was in my head and then somebody will say “no, no, you don't think about you… think about your daughter. She needs to get married.” So in my head I was like I am an older person I need to think about my daughter. But my kids were very much supportive. They love Ijhtaba. My daughter talks to him about, about any mashwara [advice] and everything, you know, even though they were both were fine, but yeah, it was hard for them. It was hard for them. And I'm finding out now that my daughter when I was married, and I was moving, I was selling my stuff. She just... she was working at the time, but she started acting up. Yeah, she would not let me hug her.  Like she was angry all the time. Because, you know, it was her house and now she doesn't have a house there. Yeah, I'm, I'm the house and I'm not there. So at that point, I was realizing but I was planning to move here. I and I was going through my own emotions. When I was getting married. I didn't think I didn't sleep for like three months. You know because I'm Leaving my job and I'm leaving my house… So she got into that and, and for months, she would not let me hug her. She just closed in. And I didn't know what to do because I was moving and then when I was moving, she left her job and she went to Europe for three months. Backpacking. I was kind of worried but then she is very strong headed and she has a good head on her shoulders. I trust her completely you know. But there was so much going on.. so many pieces were moving that I couldn't even you know, focus on one thing, but she left for three months. She quit her job. And between that time I moved to Montreal. She came back to Montreal to me. And then she was just depressed. She didn't have a job, she spent her savings and it was and this is not her house, and before I was completely hers, but now I have a husband. You know, so he needs as much attention as she does. And so she would not get out of the bed and then after literally yell and say, you know, you need to do something. And I know she wanted to stay here with me, but she couldn't because she couldn’t work. She doesn't have her health care. She was getting depressed and depressed, and depressed. It was very hard. It was very hard. And his kids were, even though they were older, but the other piece was with me that I'm here in their house. Its not my house. So the next morning when I moved here, I was like, I sit on the sofa and I'm like, Okay, now what do I do? I feel like I'm a guest, because this is not my house. But what do I do now? You know, things were not in right places, you know because they were just living. So it's just like, but I couldn't change things like this because I have to still feel that it's their house. I am the one who's coming from outside and then my daughter came and she's depressed. And so, yeah, I mean, it took about a couple of months for her to just move. She went back to Jami in Chicago. They both start fighting because it was just a roommate situation, you know, they she, she was just not…she became a little difficult and as well Jami became difficult and I was in the middle and I got this new house going on…New family, but then she found a job so she was okay. And then I recently found out that Jami was not Okay. He felt like I had abandoned him. So… and I just found out recently…he's seeking therapy. Naz is also seeking therapy and they want me to go for therapy also. Theyre like mom, it's really good because you gotta go you know, get your issues out because when the things happen I was always taking care of them, you know like the divorce. And instead of having time for my depressio. I was taking care of them. So they both are fine now. But in our therapy is they tell them to you have to go and confront people…tell them what's not right with you. So he did, he confronted me. (laughs) and, and I could you know, it was a time when he felt that I was not there, but I was there but he was so depressed that he didn't see me in the house and I was so depressed that I didn’t see him in the house when we were going through the divorce. And he, he told me that, you know, he felt like I abandoned him, but I was like, No I didn't abandon you. We were just too depressed to see each other. He's okay. But we figured out Naz was always the one who would scream. “I want this… why you're not looking at me.” You know?. And Jamal was always quiet. So, he bottled up, and I was thinking he's okay, we have to handle Naz. She's the crazy one. But apparently, she's not the crazy one. We all know we were the crazy ones, we were bottling up everything but anyway. So yeah, it was. It was amazing journey. So he's okay now because he just let it out. And I'm glad that he did that because if he didn't tell me what was bothering you him about me, then I would not know this all my life and I didn't know. I would not know why he's upset. Yeah, at least now he give me a chance to explain myself to say, you know, this is what happened to me, you know? \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tNo, no, no, that's all right. That's totally fine and those issues I mean, did they also are they in touch with their dad as well? And\", '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYeah, they are in touch with their dad but they try not to. So it's, it's hard for them because he he is very difficult person that he doesn't think about other person. He keeps telling Naz that she needs to get married because she's getting old. Shes 28…And nobody will marry her. And, you know, she's losing her. You know, her time to get married. So you will find people, kids, boys, that just want a Green Card and just want to to move here. So he would tell them no see, your time is going you will never get married because you're old, you’re getting too old.  So they don't talk to him. They don't need this.. They still call him to ask him how he's doing. He had two bypasses. He almost was going away and then we came back. He's going very strong now so so yeah. You know, they don't talk to him like Jami had confronted me. He did not confront his dad. you know, and I'm fine. So I think that he took twice on me because he couldn't, you know, yeah, the other part. So, which is okay, you know, but he would get worried about his dad if you hear tornados coming or hurricane came. Yeah. And he would be like, Oh, I have to talk to pap, you know, see how he's doing. So the connection is still there.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo dad's also based in Houston?\", '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYeah. He has remarried. And it was funny because I met his wife. And she is very simple, very simple woman, you know, and she told me, she said, you know, kind of like “aap to janti hain na” you know.. yeah. She was, she was trying to tell me that she's in trouble with him, right, like I was. But she's not telling me in complete words. what she's saying that you know how it is, You understand, kind of like, Yeah, I was so sad because I couldn't do anything for her like, yeah, you know, I understand. So, He's married. He's in Houston.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay. And so you the first time you move to the States, it was because of a marriage visa as well. So you kind of got married. Have you moved there?', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYes. I had a marriage reason. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it's it's kind of interesting because one husband asked me American nationality, the other one is getting me Canadian nationality. Laughs \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tWell, if that's it, then that's it. Right? Like what are you gonna? Yeah. Okay, so. All right, I suppose. Let's talk about your family back. Do you have mom and dad back in Pakistan? Your own parents?\", '', '', '', 'Me:\\tYeah. Yeah, I have my mom and dad both. My mom is a US citizen. Oh, great. Okay. My dad is not because he has remarried. So he have two wives. We are from the older wife, not older – the first one. So he, my mom is with him now because he had a stroke so he couldn’t move his body right. He can only move his hand and he cant walk. But his second wife with who he was all that time passed away oh so then then you know after he had a stroke my mom kind of went back to him.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tright okay and when was the last time you visited them in Pakistan?', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tOh my god long time ago I don't go to Pakistan that often I only been there twice. So the last time I think is was 2000. that's a long time ago a long time. Yeah, my father was, you know, fine that that time and my mom she comes and goes so see her more often. I haven't seen my dad yet and talk to him on the phone here and there.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAwesome. And let's just talk about your I suppose now your skills that the research is about and so, and I when I asked about skills, what are your skills? I don't just mean professional skills. I also mean life skills, you know, like what, what makes you somebody who's skilled, how can you contribute your skills to this country?\", '', '', '', \"Me:\\tSo in the US, I was working as a, I started my job as a pharmacy technician, I have a Pharmacy technician certificate and I have an associate degree. Just a general one, you know, I took some classes at a community college. So then I started working as a pharmacy technician and that was my first job ever, never worked before ever. And it was Baxter I was a pharmacy technician and then there we had pharmacist and technicians. And manager, and General Manager. And what happened that we had a FDA audit and it didn't go well, because the paperwork was not completed. You know, nobody was doing sign up and nobody was actually checking. They were just doing things. So we had a big fine with FDA and at that time they needed a person to see paperwork from outside eyes - not to be involved in the room or anybody. Before the drug goes to the patient. So I used to when I was a technician, in my break, I used to ask my manager to give me filing, you know, something that I do differently. And, I don't know, it's, it was just me. And then they thought about me, you know, so I interviewed for that position. It was a documentation clerk, and they hired me, and it was very interesting because one day I was with the pharmacist and the technician and I was working under the pharmacist, under their license. So they say yes, and then I start, you know, filling up drugs and this and that. The next day, I was a got this position. So I was sitting outside and checking their batch record, oh, telling them that I'm not producing this batch because you didn't sign for area clearance, or you didn't sign who performed it? And they would be like, no, because, you know, you know, they did it. They just forgot to send I'm like, I'm not signing this paperwork, because if I sign it, then it becomes my responsibility. And then like, No, you don't know and under white guys, you know, big guys, and I'm this Pakistani. Laughs. And I would cry and then the manager would literally yell at my head, you know, they would just go against me, you know, but I'm like, No, I can't you know, because this is my position. I can't release this batch and I would keep batch close to my, my desk and I'm like, No, I'm not. So yeah, I bumped a lot of heads and I we used to cry, because, you know, I wanted to do that, you know, I couldn't release it. And, and later on I mean, they they started and my manager was not actually in Houston, my manager was in Chicago. So it's not like somebody was protecting me. I had to protect myself. I had to be the guy. So then, yeah. Later on, they were all they understood, because when FDA comes in, they are not the one who's explaining. I'm right in front of them. Like I'm sitting with you. And I'm explaining to you why I signed this paperwork and why I think this batch was correct. So at that point, I realize that I can fight you know, I can be you know, I can put my foot down and I never knew I had that part. Anyway, because in Pakistan, my education was not that I did Inter. And since my, there were issues with my mother and father and my father got remarried and all that, and there were seven of us. somewhere we got forgotten, you know. So, you know, at that point, I was an authority, even though I was just pharmacy technician, but I was authority with the pharmacist because I can't rely, you know, it's up to me to release the batch. So I realized that part in me, and then they they got used to me. And then it was funny because I was not a manager, and the manager would come as a quality manager over me, but they would be so scared to get out of their office and knock on the door because they have to, you know, confront people. And I would be still the one who’s on the floor. But I felt that I felt that even though and I worked very hard, I worked two shifts, I worked there 10 hours, I would not get paid for 10 hours. But since I started the quality, it was my baby. So I was kind of like, you know, and the managers, they would just sit in their office and would not come by the manager would just sit and sleep in his chair because the light will go off on its own because this had motion detector on it. And he would be sleeping and I'm the one who's facing the pharmacist and the manager, the audits and everything. So at that point, I was working too many hours and since I was having issues at home with my husband, that was kind of my refuge. And I remember I bought books from library saying how to handle a difficult situation because I was facing that at work. And my husband, my ex would get mad. He thought I was trying to control him. So, you know, so I was dealing with that part, you know, and he got jealous of me because I was not having college degree. I was doing so good. And he was not doing that good. So I was kind of like, you know, in that situation. And then I mean, I did spend a lot of time at work. I did night shifts, I did morning shifts, so I would do two shifts at one time while I was going through my divorce also. And I know I neglected kids but that's the only thing I knew, you know. And I know my company used me a lot because they didn't pay me overtime. They were like go your supervisor you supposed to do that. But then I later much later on I realized that no, the other supervisors were getting overtime. I would spend weekends there. You know, I would just go there at night and make sure everything is okay. Yes, I'm Who's facing FDA and I know they used me and I know I did neglected my kids at that point but that was kind of my refugee, you know, refuge kind of thing that I was somebody there. So then, um, so I always wanted to, to do a business. I would always think okay if I… if I didn't have work, you know I would do a business and with 22 years of service, I had 401k plan I had stock I had a house. Financially, I was okay. My kids went to college… they both finished college because I was like you do whatever you want to do but just finish college because I knew I didn't have college I would work twice as much as the person. So thank God even though our situation was not great. But my both kids Finished college. And I think that was the motivation to get out of the house. So I had, I had management skills even though I didn't have a manager title, but I never had manager, So I was the one who's managing a lot of different personalities, you know, so and then so then when I moved here I was Yeah, I was thinking what am I gonna do? Okay. Part of me wants to just retire. you know, because I work 22 years. 22 years.Yeah, very hard job. Part of me just wanted to relax. You know, because I was always I used to I remember I used to walk. And I would never know how I made it to point a to point b because I used to walk fast. Yes, with the FDA. You know, you have to make copies you have to, you know, you have to be like this. And my mind, start moving very fast. So it took me a long time to calm my mind down because I'm it's always on. So now when I'm here so I do bring a lot of different skills. I never really realized that I have different skills I thought okay I'll get a job as a quality or in pharmacy or something. I came here and I wanted to relax the first year but the language was the main thing here that you have to have a French. I started taking French classes 2016 …completely boggle my mind because it was just like vern, grammar, and going back to the school and you have no idea what is the chair the teachers are talking is in French and I'm like, okay, explain to me this and they're explaining to me in French. I don't understand them. So it took a couple of months and then I took time off from that because I guess I don't need French, you know, because I'm in West Island. And then a friend of mine sent me this job posting at Simwa. Simwa is a government organization and they give French classes and job assessment for the immigrants in West Island. So she sent me this job posting that they are hiring recruiters to recruit students from, from South Asian community for French classes. So now, you know, I got this posting. So then I got into that job mode, you know.. I used to do interviews, I used to take interviews. So I'm like, okay, you know, so I did, went and did the interview. And they were saying that you don't know French. I'm like, well, you don't need French. Because the people who I'm talking to, they don't understand French. You're looking for somebody like me, just recently come and came and don't, you know, need to take French classes and I know why they are not taking French classes. So, you know, that's how I can connect with them. So they hired me, I did really good interview. I convinced them. I was like, okay, you know, I would tell them. If you have kids, and you don't know French, and your kids will know French, they will have secret language. Your daughter will talk on the phone in French and you have no idea where she's going and meeting. They hired me on the spot. So I got this position and others. And I didn't realize I always thought I didn't know how to talk. I mean, I'm talking now. But I didn't know that. I can talk to strange people because now I'm in that mode that this is my job. I have to provide, you know, in 16 weeks, I was supposed to give them 100 students. I give them 100 students in one month because what I realized is, with South Asian community, they're scared. So you go, you tell them they have no idea what's out there. They have no idea it's free. You know? They're like, Oh, it's free. I don't have to pay anything. Yeah. So then I got more. You know, I went to Mandir, I went to Masjid I went to go Gurudwara, went to the Buddhist temple, I went everywhere, you know. And, and this part of me, I'm a more of open minded with religion, I always find very peaceful in all different religions. And there was my plus point, because there was other person with me, and she would hesitate to go to Mandir. But I would be going to church and attending the things and go to, you know, Mandir, and I was handing out flyers and I remember in lunchtime and there was a guy who asked me, he said, Oh, so what part of India you're in I'm like, I'm from Pakistan. And everybody turned around and looked at me. But no, they were very nice. Yeah. So um, so yeah, so I didn't realize that I have that. And since I had a background in quality, I was. I did hundred it's not like Okay, I'm done. You know, in one month you got you, but I did, which they didn't have and now they're realizing that part, and I am very happy about it because they should realize it. But what I did was a student that I brought in for them. I started tracking them, right. Okay. What class they are in, you know, if they left Why did they left? Yeah. So they, they had no idea so I propose to them. I said, You know what, I've got those people here. I need to know where they are because if audit comes in they should know what happened to them. There was a government officer who came in who wanted to see the program. So, he met us and I had no idea about French Okay, I mean, he this guy was there for two hours. My manager was there for supervisor everybody speak in French. Yeah, I have no idea what they said two hours I was sitting. Yeah, after that. And my manager, she would be like, Oh, you know what he said, right. I was like, I don’t know what he said. I was so mad. I was so like, handicapped. You know. Anyway, uh, my contract ended with them. I mean, till the end, I was just giving them you know, that whole sheet that I've made in English and I give them all their registration forms around every couple of them I couldn't find so I emailed to everybody. So, I left. They didn't rehire me because I didn't know French. But now I'm still in touch with them. And now I, I've, they've told me that now the government is asking them to give them all the registration information about the students what I was giving to them, but they have no idea. So, um, so but then so once that happened I was like okay, everything on the side, I have to learn French, so I'm taking full time French classes. So, and then the friend of mine I told her about simwa recruiting so what are my skills in recruiting. So she…she asked me to recruit for her. She works as a director… as a director is for agency called a microcredit Montreal. So what they do is they provide microcredit for new businesses. And they are giving workshops for women to become an entrepreneur. So she said, Could you do that for me, for me and, you know, recruit students so I can come in and give classes here in Montreal. I said, Okay, so she's paying for my time I'm doing part time for her. And this is what I do. I go around and I to church to organizations and I talk about you know, what this is, how important it is for women to be independent even do a part time job or you know, business. And I think it's good for me because I wanted to a business but I don't know how so this workshop will be good. So um, so yeah, that's so my skills would be management skill. I'm very good in managing people. Organizing, making sure procedures are followed. Communication. That's my story strong I can I can, you know, in my French class, I was telling them about the microcredit Montreal program and I got about six people signed up. Six people signed up. So far. I have 10. She told me that she needs six for her to start the class. So, I have done I need to get some more because January's the class time. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tNo, no, it's good. It's good. This is really good. Alright, so we'll go into the mapping part now so that we can get started. So you can draw this like I showed you examples, however you like. I will ask you the question. And each question that I asked you needs to be represented on the map. So normally, people do it on one sheet of paper, but you can take more paper if you want to know I'm sorry to keepIt's not it's totally fine. I am. This is the recording.

My passport, marriage documents would be one thing that we provide her that and…yes, the full… how, how did we meet? What restaurants we went to, where what was the first time we met? And what did we say to each other gifts, any gifts we have given to each other. So, we are I remember taking pictures of that. How many times he had come and visit me. So, we had to, you know, the itinerary, print out all of those. How many times I went there. Even though when she did her, she documented everything. And then she sent us. She sent us the whole thing to sign and my husband just signed off but then when I got to read do it, there was so many mistakes. So, the dates were not right. And you know, because I have a quality mindset, just like okay, I cant just sign this one. I got to make sure that everything is fine. And it didn't match. I could have written better. Yeah, but yeah, so those dates we have to provide, birth certificate. I had to provide my birth certificate. It was so funny because I couldn't find my birth certificate. So I had to provide birth certificate I remember that. I didn't I didn't know what happened to my birth certificate. So now because now the whole process has changed now there's some some kind of NADRA, some kind of organisation. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tcan you tell me about technology? So how do you use technology in your migration process? So for example, a lot of', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tso Yeah, a lot of technology. So we used Viber. Yes, we use fiber because that's the and we were so glad we had Vibber because we would text each other so many times call each other so many times. Emails… we used email also. Email. Yeah. So those were the two things that we used. Texting - viber for texting. And this is to mainly stay in touch with each other. I used Facebook. Yeah, we used Facebook also. Umm, yeah how cold it is. Yeah. Because I had no idea. I've never seen that cold before, and all really doesn't get this cold. Okay, Houston. You know how it is right now? I'm saying that's our cold. This is December, January. Yeah, that's it. So I had no idea and I remember I google Yes, I did Google shoes. Because he told me snow boots. And I was like yes I have my long boots and I'm okay. But he's like, No, that’s not gonna go. You need snow boots. So we Google that. es. So we move on to that goes on the map. And then some snow jacket no and shoes and. It was funny because I could not imagine you know that people wear those shoes I couldn't imagine in cities you know you look at those shoes and you think of okay, like Alaska…that's the thing comes to your mind. Like Igloo. I mean, it looks magical. I love it. It looks magical but my God, you know, you just…like the heavy jacket and then boots snow boots heavy ones, then hat, scarf, like going out you need at least five minutes to get ready you know, I mean thinking making yourself okay I gotta get out you know I have to wear all this.. and then coming back in you just have a lot of things to take out. It was funny because I went to us like I went to his friend's house for in Toronto in April. They did my dawat, you know, so I went to a friend's house and all of a sudden I see these Pakistani ladies, theyre all wearing shalwar kameez and you know, and I'm like, Oh, that's nice with the really pretty shoes, the sandals and everything. So when they were leaving and outside in the Snow. So when they were leaving, they took the shoes out, the sandals out, and they put it in the bag. And then they've got the snow boots and they put those on. They all carry their shoes with them. So that was a new thing. So that was the same month I was going back. So that April here it was snowing. In Huston it's April… there's no snow there's like, summer is coming right. So I was going back to Huston and as like, okay. It's going to be from airport to the plane so I don't even have to go outside. So I go in my chappals/sandals. So then I'm at the airport, Toronto airport. And they say, okay, the plane is ready. But it's 10 o'clock at night, but we have to go walk outside. And I'm looking at my chappals and its snowing outside, and I couldn't believe that in April it snows here. So then I walked into the snow here. So yeah, so then I walked in. I was moving this guy's arm because he was like, I'm gonna slip slip, just hold me and then went outside stairs to the plane and then went it was.. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tYeah, I think I'll miss the big snow part. I think I'm gonna go before that. OK, so now on the map. Oh, so let's talk about social connections. So before you moved to Montreal Did you have any friends or family I mean your as your husband was here but friends family greater community that that you had here anybody that you could come in? I mean did you have to make friends did you have to make friends\", '', '', '', \"Me:\\tI had to make friends. In Montreal I didn't know anyone. It was very different because when I moved to America I had kids there so you you kind of connect with the people who have kids right? So you connect with everybody? Yeah you just like you know make 100 friends there because they all have kids and you're just like going you know, doing dawat and all that, picnics because of the kids. Here I don't have kids. So I have to make friends and I got to used to in Huston - having my own group I didn't have a lot of friends then either either later on in life, you pick and choose and you just Just have to small group of people. You know, and that's it, you just meet. So. And here, I didn't know how to make friends. And there in Houston, I had my family, my six siblings, so I didn't really need to. If I want I could just go to their house. Here, I had no idea what to do. I had no idea what to do. And I was…the only people I know is my husband and his sister. And my husband knew someone and we would go you know, but he was, he was divorced. You know, the people don't invite single guy. The families you know, they just like to.. so he was kind of outcasted also. So he knew one or two people so we went to their house. But it's not, you know, people, they they just don't say okay, yeah, you know, well, we'll do davit.. come over, we'll do this, we’ll do that… and everybody in our age is very reserved, you know… we just got used to have our environment and now I had to make friends. So what I did was I posted on social media. There's a there is a Facebook page one Pakistani woman in Montreal, right. So now before that, my sister in law is connected with South Asian woman Community Center in downtown SOC. So she is connected with them. So they had events and she invited me there so we went there. And then my husband would be going with me also, you know, because he didn't have any friends. And now I'm his friend. And then I'm not used to of having my husband because for very long time, I was just going by myself. So poor thing he would just come with me. So, me a couple of people there and I kind of used to go there for to meet people. There I met Maya. And she told me about Pakistani women in Montreal. So then I did that. And there I posted that, you know, I'm new in Montreal. I just came here and…Do we have any meetup groups for Pakistani women or you know… I didn't have any response, but I got one response. Theres a lady, she said, I'm here new also. And, you know, we can meet or you can come to my house and she has a day care in her house. So, I just went there and she lives right close to my house. So, I kind of met her. And then we used to meet for lunch. Yeah, and she's very nice lady. Then she invited me for Eid party with a couple of other people which I'm gonna…. see in this age you don't get friendly friendly with everybody. The kind of you know, you pick and choose. So she invited me two other places, you know, other friends, but I never got that close to any of them. And then I got one person I like…so I kind of talk to her and I invited her, and then my husband knew  a lady, and she told us that she does TCF work (the citizens foundation). So she had event for that. We went to that event. And then still, I didn't know anyone, you know, most of the people. So then, there and then some new little bit here and there. And then my brother came and I like to sing, you know, I always wanted to say my, my brother can sing my father can sing, but I was a closet singer and I am a closet singer, but I have dreamed that I will be a singer one day. But um, so my brother said, Why don't you know, now you have time, why don’t you take classes for that. So then I called someone and she said, well, there is one lady and she sings really good. And she gives, you know, classes also. And apparently she lives close to my house… walking distance. So, I went to her house and start taking lessons from her and then she started inviting me. So now she is from India. So now we have… now I have a good group of people. Mostly, I don't know some for some reason I get along better with the older people. Okay, you know, I don't have young friends that many but older than me just like Auntie's in their 70s or 80s. And I would like to talk to them. So then, yeah, so then I have a very different group. I have Indian, Pakistan, Bangladeshis… everything mixed because my husband is…you know, we just don't go like okay, this is, you know. When I was taking French classes I've made couple of friends there. I made two very young girls 24 years old. I think now there probably are 30 and one is South Indian and the other one is the Punjabi Sikh. And they both are my friends, but they are like my kids age. So, I'm kind of like them, mother. So, both of them got pregnant. Both of them have babies in this month in October. One had a baby boy and the other one had a baby girl. So, I’m knitting, I’m crocheting… I just finished a blanket for the baby girl. So yeah, so that's how, that's how I made my friends.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd, and then this is again, this is a question about, maybe not so much about the map, but how was it navigating dynamics of the home like, you know, having a man in your life again, how was that?', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tI'm still dealing that. Actually, actually, it was very good. It's very good. He is very nice, very open minded, and I can talk to him about anything, you know. I mean, we can be sitting in the car, not saying anything, and we still enjoy each other's company.  Yeah, it's different because I was used to just going by myself. You know, to these parties and then or, you know, anywhere, but now I have to let him know where I am, you know, like, I'm going here and come back here, you know, things like that. Or, you know, if somebody is coming to my house then you know, he has to be okay with that, too. I just have to let him know that You know, these people are coming. Friendship - I mean, I have to think about him also that we both have to get along with people because he, you know, with sometimes people… I did have to face the situation where we go into somebody's house or a gathering and then there would be a conversation about too much religion, religious conversation, and he was just like, look, I don't want to go there. So then I had to think about him. Should I invite these people over, you know, to make my group and so, you know, he's so yeah, so it's it's a different we have to. It's different in a way also because now I have to think about him, you know, making plans with my kids also, you know, going to the US, you know, how many days you're going, when are you going to come back? So, I think we both kind of appreciate each other because I never I never had a husband… you know, my sisters would be like, you know, fighting with their husband and then talking to them the next day, you know, lets go there, we went to shopping together. I never had that. I never had that. He was 18 years older than me. So, and but I didn't mind that as long as as long as there was a respectable relationship but there was no respectable relationship. There was more of I tell you to do this and you do this, So, so I never had that I always used to distant from him, you know. I was very scared of him like he can say anything or do anything. But with him, I can say anything, its more equal, you know, he's very supportive of me and we'll just hold hands in public, you know, and so, it's, it's, yeah, but uh, you know, it's funny because my friends would be telling me Oh, aap ka to honeymoon khatam nahi ho raha [your honeymoon isn’t ending]. And I’m like “haan buhdape ki shadi hai” you know, “ab kya karen” [we got married at an older age, what to do]. It was hard, because you know, divorce is a never thought in my, you know, mind that I will ever get divorced. I thought we will get old, and then kids will grow older and then he will mellow down, you know, but as much as he was getting older, he was getting crazier. The kids were going their ways. You know, and I was like, Okay, my son is not home on weekends, he's going to his friends house and then my daughter get to this age, she'll go out also. I had to take that step. You know, I had to, I had it was not easy. You know, I had to take that step. And, you know, and I never I never thought that I may meet someone because you know, in this age dating is not easy.

Where would I end up, you know, because right now I'm going with anything that's coming to me, you know? What will happen? You know, I think that's… right now that's the biggest challenge. I'm enjoying things but at that time when I moved, I think the biggest challenge was to make my community you know, to make my friends to have a good circle, which I have right now. I think at that point, that was the biggest challenge because I you know, so…okay, if the spelling is not right…Uh, yeah, yeah, biggest challenge was first one was…making friends. Making like-minded friends. Yeah, not just any friends. like minded friends. And the second one is career, business, Yeah, and the other challenge is… the main challenges to keep….I just realized one thing it's funny how while I'm talking I'm pretty much realizing about myself. Okay, you know, the other challenge is…because before in Houston it was just me and the kids. two people I have to think about. I didn't, you know, don't have to think about me but yeah, to think of kids. Now I got mine two, his three, and then him, and then his, mother. You know, Challenge is to hold everyone together as a family. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd do you feel like a lot of that responsibility is yours?', '', '', '', \"Me:\\tYeah. I've feel that. Yeah. I've feel that because…because I see where he's not doing things, right. I'm in the house. You know, I'm more living with his kids, then I'm living with mine, but I'm not their mother. And I want to do things this way to make sure everybody is is equally treated. But I think he treats some someone different than the other in his kids and then I think there's issues with that part. But since I'm in the house I have to… at one point I was involved in it… I was like okay do this do this do this. But now I'm like no I can't do this because I get frustrated because I cant you know, I face that I'm an outsider. They're not my kids because I can you know…with my kids I can just tell them whatever I wanna tell them. Like when Naz and Jami were having issues I'm like no, Naz is like, Mom Jami is doing this to me. I'm like, Okay, tell me what Jami has done. You know when you move there, he has done this. No, I'm not taking sides… If Jami isn’t doing this, he has done many other things that are right, you have to see that also, you know. So I think that's my biggest challenge now. I'm there, but at the same time I have to put that glass wall that, you know, I shouldn't be involved in it.

So, I think I'm going to do something with food, but not like a regular catering or you know restaurant is something I want to do. But I don't know what I'm going to do. But it has to be something different and fun.  something that freelancing, which I can do, and I can stop at the point when I'm taking vacation or something and then going back to it.

[Ageing in-laws] Its challenging because they both, my father-in-law and my mother-in-law, they were 86 and 87 at that point and they were living on their own because they had been here a very long time and they had a very active life but now when I moved here, it was hard for them. Very quickly, it was very hard for them because my mother-in-law, she cant see. She has a eyesight problem and my FIL couldn’t hear So they had to move with us. I think within a year, they moved with us. So that was a big challenge because I used to be living on my own. The whole house – it was just my house. Now I have to like, they cant, I have to give them food in a plate, they cant see, you know, or they would be, or my MIL would want me to sit down with her, or watch dramas with her. And I think at one point I did that because I was excited also that I have someone at home. I never had MIL or FIL living at home. Then it gets too much, you know. And then, that part, I still would be very respectful but at the same time I would just close the room, you know and I think that was the challenging part, and then my FIL passed away and now my MIL is by herself and shes more needy because she cant see so she gets frustrated and she… yeah that’s a responsibility.  My husband is close. Since he works from home, he would take care of them, he would give them food. He is close to his parents but at the same time he gives me room also. You don’t have to do it, I’ll do it. So, Im glad he is like that. He’s not like, well you have to take care of everything. He’ll take more… but I’ll do it because you know, what goes around, comes around. I don’t want things like that. But it was challenging because we both cant fight because if we fight then they get upset. They think that there’s something they did that we are fighting about. If im not in a good mood today then my MIL start crying and she thinks that she did something and I’m not in a good mood… maybe we are fighting because of her. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tFuture?', '', '', '', 'Me:\\tI think I’m eligible this year.

I have to find out what it is because I know if I do not have the Canadian citizenship, I will not have the, I will not get assistance from government once you get old – old age assistance.

And I was like, I cant write an exam in German. learning basic German is different and doing a course In German is a lot difficult. Then something happened in Australia which made me change my mind.

And then few other people were like, you will obviously be looking at a higher salary since you’re a Masters from the States. And Im like No. I just need experience for now. I was even willing to work for free. So I was competing with the graduates from the local cities.  And then there are the IIT’s that are a completely different level. My parents wanted me to go for that but for me, but I told them in the beginning, that’s not happening. I've seen people from there. They're like, they don't last long.

So meeting people is hard, or making friends is hard, at least in my opinion in Toronto. It’s a busy city. Yeah. There was Indian food festival. I think I went to that and met some people in Toronto. Meetup has been more helpful so yesterday I went for a hike through the app. Like that was my first time and they have hikes every alternate week so that was quite nice.

Quit everything and settle here in Canada? And then does the other guy, hes like “if you have a good life? What do you want to move?” And this went on and on and on for a while.

At the same time for a woman in my country… My country is democratic but at the same time the women in same positions get much less than men…that’s disgusting… I really didn’t like that we worked two times more than men and you get to two times less money. That's because there is a huge gap. Its not the the topic of the main… usually it's not discussed sometimes know some, some companies they are good, but in my case that they were not.

So, when I arrived here, so I didn't want to go to other fields because that’s the only thing that I can do. Not that that’s the only thing but that’s the thing I would like to do. Ideally it would be urban planning but that’s a bit hard to get. You need extra licences and certifications for planners. there’s like a never-ending circle of requirements. Firstly, you need education. For education you need ... like you need to start from scratch for urban planning. For architecture it’s a bit easier. I need a confirmation of my diploma but still that takes time. So I inquire with the public support companies, support for new comers who specialise in architecture so I did some coirses for architects – certain bridging programs and then I was enrolled in a 2 month placement – unpaid unfortunately but still I got a clue about how it works because its quite different from my country and from Europe. The structure is just absolutely different. When you never did this before. Here you come and everything is wood wood wood. In Europe there is good construction but not so much as here. Like here everything is much more costly, and the materials are all wood, and they measure in inches and im used to measure in meters. Its onlt now I get used to that. After the bridging program I was directed to the co-op. That was voluntary. Not like you have to go there but instead of just sitting there wasting your time, I took that opportunity. So that was in Feb to Apr. So since April I sometimes do different projects for this guy. Not regularly but the first project I did was 3.5 weeks and now its much more faster. I enjoy when projects changes regularly.

So the government - they support the hiring of newcomers. So he was trying to hire me but the thing was the the employer needs to have his company for a year and at that time his company was 8 months. So the reason I was told is that they didn't want to emerging businesses to use this opportunity just to run their business, from scratch, they want the company that can survive so that this could be beneficial for both. So now I was waiting for this year so I am still waiting until Christmas because you never know what will happen until I have the job offer or confirmation. Because that happened to me before, when we were waiting for the response for one and a half month. I agree with the person that I will start and I did not say sorry can I go to another interview. That’s not nice.

So the thing was I applied in… I started collecting documents…I cant remember when it was but late 2017. So on 2018 – yes in the beginning of 2018. Just last year. So before that I was applying for the Green card but that was like a, I was just trying for it.. like not expecting that something would happen. That was just for fun. So, and when I was applying for the Green card I thought I would also just apply for Canada. Why not also do this application. I was considering US more than Europe – like American countries or north America more than Europe. So mu country is in the middle of Europe and Asia. Australia is a bit, maybe geographically, it’s the same difference but its so far. It feels far away. When I was in my country, I was talking to some Australians and they were spending like 2 days to get to Paris or somewhere around, like 5 changes. And Canada was like 1 day in transit. Canada is more like, I understand Canada better. Australia seems very different, like a different region, also the weather is upside down. Canada is more to what I am used to. Political situation in Europe was not very nice. I don’t think its sustainable if I can say so, stable? For immigration, like where I would go would be France – where I was studying or maybe UK. For me in France the problem was language because I didn’t have enough time to study it. French people, they’re really closed. To get in that community, you need to work really hard. For UK it was hardly possible to find any immigration options and the same like, story with Brexit and all this. Its so nervous around Europe and Canada is far away from all this. Its mostly calm. Yeah, US you have some craziness on the side. Its not like in Europe you have 10 neighbouring countries and theres a lot of political pressure. At least here you feel like, its more stable. I mean there is some political issues around through US but you don’t feel the pressure.

So, problem was the lawyer – he was certified lawyer and so actually…so, he helped around 10 families let’s say…. He sent them and then people spread the word and then second time other people came… and he just collected the money, grab the money and left and my mom was in the second part [laughs]. I was considering going to Germany before for my second year but then my university didn’t provide me some documents. So, there was some problems. I didn’t have much option. So didn’t apply to any other places and I decided to study Masters. That’s it and I moved to France and at that time, like 2007-8 there was an economic crisis which affected the construction industry a couple of years later. So, it was impossible to find a job. It was very hard. Some people were staying for PhD but, at that moment I was just tired. I thought maybe in few years. At that time I was like, no not now [laughs]. After that I came back and it was fine. I was working on a large-scale project, Asian games. So, I went to Indonesia. The environment was so nice. I wanted to stay longer. Everything was so rapid around, it was interesting. It was a great experience. It was a multicultural environment which was new to me.

It’s a little like Turkey, maybe?', '', '', '', 'D:\\tTourism is now big in the country. It doesn’t really help the locals. Its less affordable than to go to other countries. For majority of people that live, I think that’s not good. It’s just not affordable. You get paid for example $700 a month and you spend, just to go somewhere for 2 days, like $400 or $300 and for 2 days! Its sometimes that bad. It was not like this before. Before the tourism was not so developed. So what worked for tourists is that the visas got cancelled [visa on arrival].

At the time we didn’t spend it all yet and I was lucky to get, like contact some lawyers that some people from my country recommended. It was still a risk but it’s always a risk. But there was no possibility of doing this without a lawyer. And then I just started collecting documents. They requested like, this paper, medicals, diploma, something something. I was just sending that and then after we applied, in August – we applied in March. In 6 months we got the response that we need to pay the arrival fee – the last step.

To get through that you need time, you need hours of research. But still you get what I mean. That’s why I prefer to use a lawyer. Even the date, the date you apply plays a role. The same application a couple of weeks later could be different. So now, I know they should be certified and you can check them online. At that time, I don’t know, maybe I was lazy.. It was comparing to the salaries I get in my country, it was expensive. Considering I managed to save money working on the international project, I was fine.

It was so ridiculous because once I had a mark of 8, at least 7.5 or 8.

So I had to go 3 times.  Also, I did translation services of Diploma, and the Minister of Foreign affairs confirmation for Diploma, like conformation by local authority. Also, here, that was for my husband mostly. ', '', '', '', '', '', \"M:\\tAlright, let's move on. So now let's talk about the role of technology in your migration.

So here it was email – all coordination and registration and results [IELTS] – all communication was like skype, emails. Also, I will not mark the rest because that was in person, translation was in person, WES was by mail. The transcripts I had requested by main from my French university, so they had to send to it WES directly. I cant say I studied a lot but what I studied was enough for me to understand that I need to hire a lawyer. I'm really lazy person. I'm not so stupid but I'm too lazy [laughs]. I used the internet mostly to get general information on immigration. I don’t know exactly but the governmental immigration website, CIC… and upon arrival same website for finding my realtor… that was the first website, I have it in my email [checks email]. And I was using WhatsApp mostly before arrival. That was only discussions. Now I join FB groups but then it was mainly that. I still use Whatsapp mostly for family and friends lets say. Here I used more skyping, and emailing still was common practice. I used FB but just scrolling – not much. Maybe just social groups. You start talking to people and then you get busy and don’t reply and then it comes up that you didn’t respond for a week and im that person, I feel ashamed to write afterwards again so sometimes it just goes vanished. I hate the discussion forums. Im not in that. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo we'll move on now, let's talk about your social connections so friends, family, \\t\\tAnything that is a big role of the family or friends or professional networks.\", '', '', '', 'D:\\tI don’t have a big family.

Both emotional and financial, I would say, until…lets start from here [France0 Financial support for sponsorship, I’m the only child and…. here and here [Toronto] mostly emotional, sometimes financial by mom, Toronto is an expensive city. So that was the JVS company that directed me to the bridging program. So that was the JVS employment services for placement and support with application to governmental program, support for employment for future employment and still they have covered some expenses like free books for the course, business cards. So here the student support was financial. That’s it for now. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay.

That's the thing she needs to not accept, to over come at some point because after sometime when I get an opportunity to work and become more stable, I will bring her here because otherwise we both would stay there and having no big perspectives so its better to hope for that now. I don’t know if I could explain that. In the future, but not like in a year or 2. Shes working now. Shes fine now.

I don’t know maybe some major  changes would interest me but small stuyff, not. Im interested to watch it atm [elections]. Im not interested to participate because I don’t have the full rights to participate at the moment. You can vote when you get citizenship. That’s the only difference between PR and citizenship. ', '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\t Tell me about the biggest challenges of migration…challenges or obstacles.', '', '', '', 'D:\\tAll these challenges or obstacles you face, once you arrive, sooner or later you will solve them. So this one, not big one, missing.. like my husband he has a diploma that he didn’t actually receive because people in the university, they were lazy and they didn’t do it – So diploma is like a book so they just sent it without transcripts and all. Missing pages in the diploma. We knew the people who were working in the university so they solved our problem fast. If we wouldn’t know that, because that was the time of summer, if we wouldn’t know these people, it would extend it for 3 or 4 months and still we need to go and ask them. You know sometimes they send it somewhere else. We managed to solve this in 2 or 3 weeks. Its not so much considering that they had to dig, take it out of the archives and do the job, and to stamp it, and to sign it. I was surprised it was solved that fast. The challenge – the biggest challenge and still for now is like, employment and in my case, first thing that is challenging is that there is no Canadian experience which they stick to no matter where you work. It can be McDonalds, or any other place, cleaner, doesn’t matter. If you don’t have Canadian work experience, it reduces your chances of employment. So, lack of Canadian experience and they want it usually longer than a year. I have here like 5-6 months. They usually write like 3 years on Canadian experience, 5 years of Canadian experience in the job ads. I find it a challenge because that’s n ot fair. The thing is that if I was told that they don’t care the skills in Canada you have so even the cleaner, or some service jobs – they still would consider it a Canadian experience. Even if you apply for design but you haven’t worked in design, they still would consider you. But I think that’s the perception coz I was working in an international environment and I know the system – how it works. So maybe for some people its important. You also have interviews for that to understand that people can work or not. But on the point of applications, you should not just throw the paper without looking at it. Certifications, licensing, there is also another local expect for WES, another diploma confirmation. So, WES works only for arrival. Here, you need to go to another, in my case. WES only works for immigration purposes. Generally, its good. I had it added in my resume but actually, the diploma is confirmed by WES. This certification, this should be a CACB authority – that’s architecture board. Im not sure if planning has it as all. But they are some courses that are not approved at all. But I hope to do that in some time because it is still costly. The challenge I would say, is finding an apartment because you don’t have a credit history and that reduces your chances. We behaved well and very nice, really because I have education and I can say that im not going to not pay you money. I don’t want that problems. I think that’s – maybe that’s a perception but that still works in some cases. I found the driving licence a major obstacle for me. Yeah, coz I didn’t have a car before. I had a license back in my country before. Here the system is.. first of all you get the G1 which is training. Then after a year you still can drive only with a person who has the G4. I can only drive on my license only for 30 days or 60 days. And I failed it too. And the thing is I need a confirmation from my country to get the licence directly but that’s an issue now that I am here. And still this is an obstacle for jobs as well because even if I have a good commute to the location of the interview, most of the cases they ask about the driving license. That’s an issue because in most of the job descriptions, it is written that they require a G4 driving license. So for me, its like a huge… its not a challenge, its an annoying. I decided to wait for the confirmation from my country because I don’t want to go through the test again, because what if I don’t pass it again. When I have this letter, they allow me to get the license directly. I just applied it today. That was local fee plus payment to home country embassy for driving experience confirmation. [husband] did that already. So he did that I didn’t and we decided to do that because at least one of us would have it. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHave you given migration advice to any other person about Canada?', '', '', '', \"D:\\tYes but I'm not sure if they move forward with that but couple of my friends, they are interested and, I think they are considering in the next couple of years not immediately. Im never active on advising unless they ask for that and that's their decision absolutely so if I can advice…im not going to push. In one case I just said like you know just do it if you want to do this..go to Canada if need to do some changes you should start instead of just sitting complaining. \", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tDid you receive any bad migration advice from anybody?', '', '', '', \"D:\\tI heard a lot of complaints from the people for here. Always the people who stay here say that go back. There's some sort of people are never satisfied. They're always complaining. So I just try to avoid this people. That was on the forums maybe just maybe once or twice on YouTube, by community. They complain in some cases. Like what happened was my husband was addicted to youtube before arrival to Canada. Like last two weeks. He was just sitting so stressed. I just asked…What are you? Why are you so stressed? It looks like so bad he told me. I said Why? And he said I watched it on YouTube. I was like can you imagine any normal person was satisfied with his life, coming to YouTube and saying how good it is? No. Usually people come to complain. You only hear mostly the negative. Especially for post-soviet people..the mentality of our people. It's not only them…. I am like this too, but not so much. I hope so. Always complain to find the bad things, to discuss it…this could be better or I had it better before. Usually you watch it in your own language and this people, when you Google it, it comes out as research. You see the negative just stop watching that please please…And he said like yeah, maybe you're right. And really the fact that maybe we didn't meet the circumstances this people met when they came.

I would be happy if I have 2 kids. Probably get the mortgage before they come so they have a house. In the more future. I don't know how is it possible, Maybe a design company? That one is very far but I would like to invest in green technology, not developed but, there are many young researchers to do their job very well and they just need to push to get into the market. You know that franchise thing? You get their idea and stuff and they still get to participate… something like that…maybe in, how can I say it? green technologies – but that’s way too far.

Oh, so that’s something here - for Junior position they consider me as overqualified. In intermediate positions, I don't get to that stage. So, in many cases, they…when I applied for the project technician lets say, they say you need to go more to design. When I go to design, they say I don’t pass the search engines.

Its pretty costly to do things at the moment because of the financial situation. But we are in the process of getting a car. Its still the cost of insurance, its like crazy. The average is around 200 a month which is a lot. For me at the moment, I don’t need a car. Its also crazy parking prices. I would rather drop it at a subway that has a parking and take the train. But for my husband, hes commuting to the north part and there are only buses and the distance is not that much but he wastes like one hour for only 5 kms.

It was the party that used to govern Mexico, and basically turn Mexico into pieces, was going back into power. And everything was getting really dangerous, crime was spiking again. And I was just tired. And also those lack of opportunities, so what happens in Mexico is because of the economy model that is used… the gap between middle class and high class is getting really really big right to the point that right now there's not really a middle class in Mexico. It's either you have a shit ton of money or you're working class and if you lose your job, you're basically homeless. So I was approaching the bottom and and that was just tired. I was just tired of being working 10 to 12 hours a day plus something extra to come later just to make extra money. And then I think the cherry cherry on the cake was the this the Peña Nieto who was a president, he won. It was a fraud but he won and he was going to be the party is going to come back and steal everything… just destroy the country again, which it happens. But I wasn't there anymore.

I would say there are other factors that, that I know when I think back at the time, I know like one was, I think I wanted to reinvent myself. That's one thing that I couldn't be. I couldn't do it in Mexico. Another thing I would say I wanted to experience a different culture. I worked for a few months in Spain. Yeah. And I really liked it. But I also wanted to go to North America, and I don't like United States or Canada was my first option.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, and why Canada? I mean, we I've you just said that Canada was your first option, like had you done a lot of prior research into Canada? \", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tI did research Bunch of countries based mostly Europe, Canada, US… even and I consider the US. So it's a North America, Europe and Australia at some point, Australia too. Yeah, I checked that. And after so I'm so just to give you something Yeah, I'm a project manager. I'm an engineer, I have a software engineering degree. So, I'm very methodical person. So basically, created a huge spreadsheet with pros and cons for every country.. So, it was kinda interesting that I mean, the first thing that we consider was we need speak the language. That's one of the things that we wanted…that narrows or I mean, not a lot, but now is basically to the US, Canada, in America, the UK, I mean, Scotland and Ireland and Spain as well and Australia. was basically that in the end that those ended up being a..lets say second choice. And then after that I did all this analysis and all the immigration processes of the openness of the culture regarding immigration. And after reading all that, I realized that Okay, so it's Australia or Canada. Those are the more open cultures loving immigration. So either or so, and the main decision was well Australia’s kinda far. And so if, and it had happened, so if one of our family members of friends die, we want to be there. If we took a flight from Australia to Mexico City..it's like 27 hours. If you took a flight from Toronto to Mexico it is four hours.

Express entry started… I think was like 2016,,, should be 2016 or maybe 20, late 2015 that it started. So all of this sort of programs like the Canadian experience class… they existed, okay, but it didn't have Express entry.. So extress entry is just the way you select applicants. But back then before Express entry, you submit something… you wait for a year, a couple years. And then at some point, you get a letter that says “Oh, thank you”. Actually for the podcast.

We only use one resume, and just send it everywhere. So those little things I learned by studying that. So I think I'm so happy that I picked that thing. But that was not the reason.

Like, I knew that I had the skills to get a good job and all that. Is that kind of question. Yeah, and I think studying here, the HR course was pretty healthy. Just to, because you know what, it's funny because I don't think it happens a lot in Latin America. And I don't know if other countries but at least in Mexico, it happens a lot that you see people from the US or Canada and you automatically assume that everybody knows more than you.

I'm very inclined to the left.

Toronto is a bubble. Toronto is… for me it's great and that’s why I want to do the podcast in Toronto because for me Toronto is amazingly good. You have no 50% people here immigrants and and I even in my job I think Canadians are the minority. We have like six Canadians and 50 immigrants so it's a for me it's a bubble and I like the bubble. That's why I live here. But if you go outside if you go to small towns, it's completely white towns and they're really nice people and then might not discriminate you but they are the ones who got Doug Ford into power. They are the ones who are going to be voting conservative this time. So, it's a it's a polite, it's an open society, but still a conservative society. If you think about it, getting divorced here, you need to, I think be separated for a year or may prove that there's some kind of physical violence. And when you think about the most progressive country even in Mexico, you can get divorce because its like I don't want to be married with this guy anymore. It’s like okay fine sign this and you’re divorced. That's it. So, this kind of things actually made me think.. like even with Europe. Like one of the more progressive countries like Spain, it's kind, its way behind. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tIf applicable, which it is in your case. So tell me about all the visa categories you went through from the point of your initial arrival to your current status. And we will include wait times, processing times and any bridging visas or bridging so in Australia, it's bridging visas, but here I don't think that's applicable. We do have a bridge Oh, you have actually applied for that as well. Alright. So that's, that's kind of the show. \", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tLet's start from where from here. I have nothing. So, let's say I was here it was in Mexico. And then right now I have a PR in Canada. Okay. So what I did, I started here. So at the beginning based I told you we were doing with an agency in Mexico. So, they suggested to apply for the PR as a skilled worker. So that I would say that happened here. She was like a PR application, and was skilled worker was. Oh, that's another thing and right now you have the express entry and depending on your points, you apply for something. Back then you needed to apply to something in particular. Either you applied for a Canadian experience PR or skilled worker PR. So, you had to pick one. So, we applied for skilled worker. We, when we didn't apply, we were submitting all the papers and or the agency something changed then. This was the, this was December 2009. Okay. Something happened. I don't remember what, but something changed for the next year. So starting in January, there's something changing. We didn't have all the requirements and papers and all that. So we basically discarded this. And then we went just like Okay, now let's apply for PR, but it was for Provincial Nominee. That one was for Quebec. This is the time when we started learning French right, and this happened. I think we did. It was early like January or February when I say February 2010. We applied for this, started learning French and all that, but they told us was like, it's gonna take a while. And when when you get it, you're gonna be, you're gonna have to submit your French tests and all that. So, you have like a year for you to learn French. Because I told you, it used to take a long time to get an invitation and then we just waited. And I don't know, let me check, we were right here in 2013. So, it was 2012 it was the summer of 2012. Yeah. So on the summer of 2012 was let's say, July. So yeah, it took two years. We received the invitation for the interview. And, and this was related to this one [Quebec provincial nomination], but the promise that the interview was going to happen in 2014. So we said like, No, we don't want to do that. And so we asked for options. And he said NAFTA. NAFTA is an option. So we started looking into NAFTA, when there was some North American Free Trade Agreement. So, the problem with this I mentioned is that getting a job from outside the country will be hard. So, this didn't work. Then, it was, was that was our issue I want. No, I'm mixing dates. This happened in 2011. Yes, 20 11 and this was going to happen in 2013 because it was not July was like almost like the end of the year, like October so October 2011 is when we received the letter, then we thought about the NAFTA. And I started looking for a job back then. And I think it took me like six to eight months or something to realize that I was not going to get a job and I was applying it was. But it was the problem with this I was applying the same way would apply in Mexico. just reading it and sending it so didn't work. So then in Well, this actually happened in 2011 and 2012 is when this guy the president won. So this one we said like you know what, we can't we can't stay here. So we applied for the student visa. Well, we started considering, we didn't apply yet. We started considering. So we started considering this, but then I got a I got a I got assigned to a project in Spain. So, I moved to Spain. The original idea was to move in September here. So we're thinking about planning for September. But then this is a great opportunity. It was $9 million project. So, it wasn't really great on the rest of the international experience. It was moving to Spain, I was going to work for the UK. So basically travel between Spain UK for a few months. So I thought it was going to be quite cool, its gonna look great on my resume. So, I cannot. I mean, we can. It's gonna be a six month project. So we can feel we can do this later. We can we can apply for for coming in January or that so we kinda waited. And then we started applying for student visa in October but then I was in Spain so we didn't have all the documents. So, we gave up and decided to apply for April. So, this is what happened. So in April. So, so we started thinking about this we ended up flying formally in well, we actually applied in October 2012. But then we delayed it onto the the summer semester. So I was in Spain from September to December. And then I went back to Mexico and it was kind of crazy because we didn't finish the project. I was working in Mexico but we Spain's timezone. I was waking up at one in the morning started working at two in the morning oh wow and by noon it was done but it was super tired yeah but at the to the story so um so we applied back we applied then we asked the college to not to apply for the winter semester we applied for summer semester and on April 29 2013 we arrived together and this was I had a student permit and my wife had a work permit. So a year past and after a year I got the so it was kind of the same, let's say April 2014. I got my work permit. At the time I got a job. Not this one I got another job that was like a super crappy job with super entry level, really bad job. That was on HR because we have we had in the program, in the HR program, we had a co-op semester, and I got a co-op position in that place. And after the four months as you're like, Hey, we want to keep you they offered me like your shitty salary. And the job was really bad. But I felt at the time I didn't have any options so I was like Yeah, I need to get a job. And also not because I didn't have any options as a person, but because I needed to start building my Canadian experience, because you needed I think, two years to apply for that because back then it was still this program that I was telling you. So when I needed to work for two years in Canada to apply as a permanent residence. So that's why I accepted. But then that worked till 2014 and then 2014 then in 2015 again around the same time in 2015 my work permit expired which was only one year, they only give you the same amount if you work for less than leave us to study for less than two years. They give you a work permit for the exact amount of time they work. But if you study more than that, they give you three years. But I only studied one year so I only had one. Yeah, here is when I applied for the NATFA. And because we already had a job in this company and for the NAFTA, you have to be you have to be working in certain professions. Not all professions can for the NAFTA. But technology is one. So if I hadn't stayed in the other job, I wouldn't be able to apply for the NAFTA. So then I got my NAFTA work permit for another year. Was in one year of two years? Okay, so we got 2018 we got the university in 2017. So, this was two years, so I got it in. Yeah 2015. I had to renew it at some point because it was you had to renew it every year. But I got this one on to like for two years. So you have to renew it. And then starting on early 2017, let's say February. I started applying for the PR. The first time that I applied by myself, I got denied and I got the denial around my birthday so it was May. It's kind of ridiculous when I was submitted all the papers I forgot to upload the translation of our marriage certificate and instead of the saying hey you're missing the translation, Can you send it back? They actually denied and declined the whole application. Yeah, and that's that's when I say that society might be open but you have some people that are still not because one of my friends forgot to upload their passport, which is even worse than the marriage certificate and they came back like hey, we're missing this documents. Could you please upload them? He did and it went smoothly. In my case they just did this. I was really upset. I called them and nobody cared. Yeah, and actually they told me that it's totally depends on the person who's reviewing your profile.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tCan you not appeal it?', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tI could. Okay, but I do have time because the thing is with the work permit, that you cannot be more than three years with a work permit… temporary work permit. You either go back to a country or you become a permanent residency, right? And if you count this work permit was two years of NAFTA, I didn't have any choice. And the good thing is that the company where I'm still at the they really liked me and they valued me so they hired a lawyer and the lawyer reapplied for the PR and we did this process right after I got to do now which was around my birthday, so say May 2017. We apply for the PR. This time, the lawyers did everything. And nothing was missed. But it's so expensive that if it wasn't the company, I wouldn't be able to pay. I think the bill ended up being like $12,000. And they paid for it, I wouldn't be able to pay for that. So I'm really I'm really thankful. I'm really grateful for them. They couldn't sponsor me because there was some restrictions. And the lawyer basically analyzed everything. And they said, this is the best approach. They did it. And it actually worked because on September 2017 we got our PR. So, you see, it's like, what, like five months or four months. And so, we got all the papers and everything. So, the only thing we needed to do was to go out of the country and return as a landed immigrant, which we did in October. We actually, we celebrate, we took a two week trip to the UK.  We toured a lot of places over there. And when we came back, we landed as immigrants in October 2017.  I think you can, if you don't want to go out of the country, you can schedule an interview with some government agency. And then you can just go there and they do all the paperwork for you, but it's faster if you go out and come back. Most of my friends that I have a flight like that. Most of them have… they drive to Buffalo, and they come back. I mean, you still need to use lead someone to actually see that you're actually the person who’s arriving? And I think the airports and the borders of they already have an infrastructure. So why spend more money having an office? If someone can just like in the end, I think the way they see it is, you're the one who's going to be wanting the permanent residency. So if you cannot go out of the country come back then...its your problem. I think it's efficient. And I think it's saving overheads. And this happens like all the work permits, they just arrive by mail. But the PR, it's different, like some kind of a ceremonial system. For us it was great because we arrived late at night. I think we are flight landed at maybe two in the morning. So, the immigration office at Pearson was empty. So, it took us like five minutes to get the PR card so well they print the cards. So you can well I guess they take a picture of their So did they take the picture there? No, they use the picture that you submitted. So actually, they could print them and mail them to you. But anyway, thats the process. You need to go out and come back. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, now, I'm going to move on to Yeah, so that's that that's with regards to the sort of timeline and visa categories right. And that's everything will go to the commercial services and things about commercial services you used in your migration journeys, the things that you paid for. So agents, lawyers, which I know that your company paid for in this case. But other things as well. So, education that you paid for career consultants that you may have paid for document translation, skills assessment anything throughout this whole journey that you paid\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tFirst we paid in Mexico for another lawyer which was the one who was helping us to do this because when we started we know nothing knew nothing so so we paid for a lawyer here we had to pay for translations of all the documents in the beginning. We had to pay for a lot of translations because every time you apply, they need IELTS, you need to pay for someone to assess and I think I had to pay now that I'm going to be applying for the citizen I think I need to do the exam again. Anyway, I applied here, then. So, we applied here. We did the IELTS here for English language, then we around here. It was right before we got the invite thing we started we applied…We presented our  I don't remember names for French, French language, French and English. We pay for those. We got here we paid for the college program. It's like three times more than what a resident or citizen would pay - 17K. So it was the cheapest one. But my friends from from here they were paying like four or 5000 so I paid for that. Then I think every time that we applied, I had to have to pay for something it was like for the PR was worse because then you need to get your criminal record check. You need to get your criminal records from your home country as well. You need to get everything translated like everything marriage certificates. All that. What else?...because at the time you had to be for a visa as Mexican, you have to apply for a visa for to enter Canada, so you have to apply for that as well. Yeah, we have to do a health assessment for the PR only. That was only for PR. What else? There were three language tests because they expire in 2 years and I have to do a fourth one now for the citizenship. Because according to but according to the government, you forget the language in two years, I guess. I don't know.  But we did pay for the place to live. What else, what else,  \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo if you remember later on that stuff that you've paid for so so we can move on. Yeah. Okay. Um, so tell me about the role of technology in your migration journey from the initial arrival stage to now. So, what I'm trying to, I suppose here is how did you conduct online research if you were doing and what sort of resources did you use if you want to put them on your map? Social media avenues, or any sort of other online assistance in your migration journey?\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tMost of the research done if not all, was done online. I'm very… I mean I am a software engineer, so I'm very comfortable doing that. So, at the in the beginning, my main was like, Google search And I used to check a lot of blog posts, blogs that talk like people. I think I noticed that when people move here, they're so excited. And they want to share their experience. So, they start writing the blog. But then after three posts, they never write anything else. But at least you have the beginning. So, you have something. Social media. Facebook, I would say, Mostly because there's a lot of newcomers to Canada group. So, Mexicans in Toronto, those kinds of things that are completely useless but I checked them. There's there was a blog that was written by... It was from Latin America, maybe Colombian and it was in Spanish then they explained the shock that they got when they went to the grocery store like prices and they were looking for bananas is like there's no banana, because it is winter. And for me, it was like, Where am I going? Then you get here and you realize it doesn't matter if it's winter, you get bananas because globalization, but I just for me at the time, that was shocking because like, where am I going like, if I want to eat pineapples, you cannot eat that unless it's summer, which is a complete lie. So, but maybe they…. maybe they weren't living in Toronto, maybe they were living in one of those small towns that I was mentioning. But for me it was kind of shocking. So, it actually gave me some ideas on what to expect. That I think was a good thing because when I got here, the culture shock for me was almost minimal. It was almost nothing.  Because I already did a lot of research. I used to work with a lot of people from the US so for me, it was not a huge deal. and I like the cold. So, I was okay. For my wife it was a little bit different. But regarding social media, I think the main reason why I think they're useless and mostly when when some blog posts it's a little different because it's someone who actually wants to share their experience, when they take the time to write some social media its mostly someone who knows nothing. x asks a question, and everybody answers whatever they think it's the right answer. So, it's like one person saying, Hey, I'm going to.. okay, remember that one. Someone said Hey, I'm moving to Toronto and I don't want to buy a car. How much should I save for, for public transit? How expensive it is. And to be honest, if you just Google Toronto Public transit, you see the first but someone asked that. And then there are little things like you're going to spend like $300 a month and then someone else is like you can buy a pass it is going to be 100 bucks. And the thing is that because there's so many answers, and most of them are wrong, that just confuse you. So, I gave up with social media, I think at this stage, and most of the most of the research I did after was either blogs that I considered more serious, or immigration lawyers websites. I saw that that that was a lot lawyers, websites. There was a lot of information there. And podcasts, And one of the things I like about the podcast is that I think I only found one that was talking about Canada, Most of them were talking about the the US or Europe. And I found it was people talking about their their experiences, but it was kind of interesting to learn how the shocks that they were Facing. So that happened way before we got here. So we did all the research. And good, I would say most of the research was done. And also the CIC website. The Canadian immigration one - That one I think I checked in every day like anything that happened is checking. And news from the global mail. I subscribed to the global mail for a bit in Mexico, just to learn a little bit of a culture and stuff like that.\", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd I want you to think of social media, I mean, technology not in terms of researching but also the role of technology in your life as an immigrant broadly. What is what is some some technology that you use or continue to use or have used? Is there any sort of significant technological', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tMostly my phone. The smartphone is because any question you have, it's just. Google Maps is amazing because you when you get to see that you need to know where you're at. Okay, Google Maps helps you. But the thing about the phone right now is that it's a small computer, you can just make phone calls with it. But I would say the most important thing between my laptop and my phone, I think those saved my life when I got here. Even for because I came as a student, I needed to take notes, work, something is just my computer. But in the day to day, it was mostly my phone and like, have a Google Maps. Anything I wanted to check was just there. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tHere what you said immigration lawyers, websites and blogs. Do you remember particular examples of these? any websites that come to mind or you don't?\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tThe guys who actually did my process over here, that's Greenland's bgl. I check their website but I, at the time I found them like a little too poshy. It ended up I mean, they're super expensive. I remember these guys because it shocked me the the cost at the time. There was another one. But it was around when I was in Spain. So, it was around this time here. Around this time, I found it when I was in Spain, and I found it and I remember it was so good that I sent a link to my wife. It was great. It was a Lawyer, but he had a blog in there. And every, every week or every two weeks he posted something about Canada. Canadavisa.com. Okay, so I guess it Yeah, it's kind of famous. Yeah, I remember I saw it when I found in Spain because I had nothing to do with my wife state and Mexico. She was like, Yeah, I was doing research. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tTell me about the role of your social connections on your maps or friends, family, greater community, professional networks, anything significant that you'd like to put on your map in how they affected your migration from the initial stage to where you are now.\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tMy family in Mexico. It was about my mom and my sister and my dad a little bit. But mostly when I talk about my family, its my mom and sister. I don't think I ever hesitated coming here because of them but it affected me because we're really close. So just one example we used to go to do have a coffee every week, like my mom after work, and then my sister arrived and then I arrived and it was like a ritual every week. Those little things affected me. And it was over here like Around this time, she was like my family. And I have a group of friends that we've been friends since University and we used to play video games together and play dungeons and dragons together,  like nerdy stuff. But we used to do it every week, every Thursday. So that was one of the things one of those rituals that you know you're not gonna have even when I moved here when we when we moved over here. So when we moved here I started to keep the show my d&d group these guys we started playing Dungeons and Dragons online. So they met in one of them's house and they just put a computer with my face there. It was fun, and I think is one of the things that I needed to still feel that I was in. Yeah, one of the good things is that I'm, I'm a very social person, but I really, really enjoy time with myself. So the first month when we got from April 29 to early June, I didn't have a phone. So, my birthday is in May 26. So, nobody called me on my birthday because there was no phone to call me. And I really enjoyed that month of having no connection with the world. I really enjoyed it. I don't know if I would do it again. But I really enjoyed it. So, focusing on another thing I was starting school was But anyway, those kind of things. One of the things I think helped me a lot is when I started when I started school at George Brown. People here were really friendly. There was like half immigrants, half non-immigrants. And and, and we started hanging out from time to time and all the things that I was way older than most of them. So those things as like, hey, let's go clubbing and I was like no Im not doing that. So those kind of things played a huge role. And another thing when I got here I one of my ideas of one of the things I wanted to do was to blend into the pot, I need to blend into the Canadian culture. So, I remember I was telling my wife that I'm not gonna talk to anyone who speaks Spanish. You're the only one and just because we're married but I actually avoided Spanish speaking people because I wanted to, to improve my language. That was the main reason because I thought if I start hanging out with Mexicans, then I'm never going to be speaking English so how can I improve. How am I gonna get there? How am I gonna get the job. How am I gonna give it all back?. So, I avoided that. So my wife started, my wife was a little different. And she wanted to have some connection with the Mexicans society and the culture. So, she started hanging out with them. So most of the time I spent with the only people were talking Spanish with was my wife and my friends from here and my mom and my sister. Here I tried not to and it took me maybe a year to start realizing that I was being an idiot, so I started just hanging out. Now I don't care. The time it was my my idea was like, I need to do this because I when I moved I was 35 is like, boy, I'm already 35 I need to get a job, I need to to make things work for me right now. Because if not, I'm going to be 40 and then I'm going to still be in a shitty job. That was my idea at the time. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tTell me about the role of so in terms of giving you we discussed families as well and regulatory aspects of your migration. So government requirements that you had to fulfill. So this includes police checks, characters, points, test health requirements, immigration forums, any significant aspects of this or any challenges of this part. Then you remember what to put on your map?', '', '', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tThe main challenge that I got was when I had to get stuff from Mexico. Yeah, like it was for the PR. It was it was actually around this time after we got approved. There was a lot of stuff that we had to get from Mexico like, criminal record so bad. It's a pain because you either had to fly there and do it yourself or fill out bunch of papers to do it. And I'm completely forgetting something here, between the NAFTA and the PR. I got a bridge permit. Bridge corporate. So what happened is that my NAFTA was, was going to be expiring in May or something or April or May because every year, and but so we need a bridge work permit. So we apply I applied, actually the company did it because it was around here. So between this, they only need to say you need to apply for the PR, and you need to submit the documentation to reapply it and you get a bridge work permit. So I applied for that. It was kind of optional. But because there's another thing that's called implied status, I don't know if you've heard about now. So if your Work Permit expires, but you're already applied for the permanent residency you're legally working in living in Canada. But and it's but you cannot leave and come back you need to stay in Canada. But in this case, the one that I applied to the bridge, it's a permit that allows you to go back and forth. They need to travel. So I couldn't stay here because because work I need to go back and forth. But I have friends that they weren't able to go. They didn't apply for this because it costs money right? And when you're in my case, didn't matter because my company was paying for everything. But it costs more money and you're an immigrant usually are counting every penny so I have friends that didn't apply for this. They waited for a few months between their work permit expired all that and they couldn't leave the country. Actually here's a sad story. One guy that I know his father died and he couldn't go back to Mexico. If you leave, you need to wait outside the country to a resolution. it has it's flawless. Its getting better I think with the express entry and all that's getting way better. It's faster. Like if you think about it in 2010 or 2011 we applied, and it took us almost two years to get an invite for an interview two years from then. And if you think about it, I got the approval in four months with express entry. So, there's improvement. Express Entry started I think it was don't quote me on this but I think it started around here is when express interest started. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tin terms of challenges and obstacles, if there's anything else you think of please put that put that on there as well. But if that's kind of it, then\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tI think, honestly, I think my path to get the PR was very smooth. Because even though I had to go and go through all this work permits, I always had support from either my wife because she was making the money to pay for things, or the company. They didn’t sponsor me but they paid for lawyer. So in this sense, I would say I was very lucky. But because there's people that I think our issue was when wanted to go to leave Mexico as quickly as possible. That’s why we actually went through all this. If we didn't, we were like, okay, we'll stay in Mexico for a couple more years, then we would just get the invite for the PR, and then we just come in. And that's it. Yeah, we wanted to leave quickly. So we went through, I don't know how many work permits. So, the student permit, then the work permit. Then my two NAFTA permits, my bridge work permit, then my denial of the PR and then the PR. So I think I went through all the permits available. Laughs. But I mean, I suppose that the benefit of getting out of Mexico like and I would do it again.. For us was more important to leave the country than to do all this. I mean it’s a pain. Every time that you need to apply for a new work permit its like let me resurface all the documents that I sent last time. You need to keep track of every trip that you did. I used to travel a lot for work. So, it is a pain. I tried to avoid going back to Mexico. Mostly because… there's two things. Firstly, I hate spending my vacation in Mexico, because if I spend money and time and vacation days I want to go somewhere new. And second,  it's very stressful to go to Mexico so well, family My family is very close. Not my close family but my extended family - like my aunt's my uncle's, my cousins, and my wife's family like we get there and everybody wants to see which is super nice. It's really nice. I really love that, my friends is that where are you coming? Let's grab a coffee let's grab a beer. But that means that every day for as long as you're there, you have something to do. You have breakfast with someone, lunch with another person, dinner with another person, drinks with another one, coffee with another one. And then you met like five or six people on a day. And you get home and we should because one time we tried to stay at a hotel. And my mom was like, she felt that we dont want to stay with her. And we ended up cancelling the hotel and staying with our families. And that's the thing like you have to be with them. So, there's no time. There's no time to relax. Yeah, so that's the stressful part. Also, Mexico is growing violent. It was violent. It was it was the crime rate was really high when I left. Now, it's worse. So maybe It's the same amount crimes the problem is that there are harder crimes. Like before you someone like I got, I was mugged five times in Mexico City which is normal. I don't like I don't know anyone that lives in Mexico that hasn't been mugged or something. That’s normal. The problem is that when that happened I was younger and all that, they beat me a couple of times to take my wallet. Now people have started killing people to take their wallet or their watch or the car so I don't want to get killed because I'm driving a car. So those kind of things. And, and even before we started this, I was talking to one of my friends and he said he's a professor of one of the public universities in Mexico. And he was telling me like he was in the public transit to one of the one of the campuses, which is in one of the poorest parts of Mexico City, and someone can came, went into the bus with a gun and basically said, Hey, everybody give me what do you have. It's one of the poorest neighborhoods in Mexico City. How much money are they going to have? So, my friend just gave them their phone. And it said that it's criminals taking money out of the poor. And that didn't happen before. It was usually the crime didn't happen in poor areas, because the poor don't have, they don't have anything. So why would you not them? Now it's getting there. And now you see if you open a newspaper from Mexico, every day you have people killed somewhere at a party at a restaurant. So, going back for me and just living that it's kind of stressful.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo how do you feel then in How's your family being there? Will you will you eventually like like, will your family migrate here as well? Now that you hope to Yeah, you want to\", '', '', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tMy mom wants to come here when she retires. My sister, she's a writer. She's a freelancer so she can move anytime. And I don't know if they're going to do it. But it would be great. Yeah, I tell them. They're welcome. They told them like, you're welcome my home for not forever. But because it's a one bedroom. But at least you can stay here for a few months, and then we'll find something for you. And they know that. Anything I can do?, I’ll do it. I can support them with money or something. I'll do it. Yeah. I think it's more on my mom. I don't see it. I think her only concern right now is she loves her job as a teacher. And she loves her and she doesn’t speak English very well so she wouldn't be able to be a teacher here. Yes, a very good she she's in university. In actually the same in Brazil, my friend is works and she's a teacher there. And they just opened the Arts program and my mom is a writer and a painter. So, she's one of the ones that's opening the program and all that so, and for my mom, her professional career has always been very important. So, I think she would be quite dissatisfied if she did. I think she needs to complete her cycle. At some point. She's gonna say like, I'm done with university and moving here, but I need to wait for that. I can sponsor my mom, I cannot sponsor my sister. The only way that I could have sponsored, it’s another thing that I that's what I'm thinking that the Canadian cultures sometimes very conservative. The only way I can sponsor My sister is if I'm single, my sister single and our parents Dead.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd what about your wife's family? Does she want to bring her family over? \", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tShe would love to. She would love to as well. That's I think that's if my family's hard. Their family would be harder.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAll right, great. And I suppose now at any point if you use any support services, so and I'm talking about NGOs or welfare services or community organizations of religious organizations, were you ever involved with anything like that during your migration journey?\", '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tNo, no, I'm an atheist as a good leftist. So, I never then there was never involved in a religious organization, not NGOs. The only thing I did is when back so just 14 I started working here. So, I got this job at horizon where I'm working at. I started on March 2014, 2015. Yeah, I've been there, four and a half years. So, March 2015, I started working here, and I got fired from my other job, the HR HR job, I got fired on December 2014. So, between January, February, and half of March, I was under the Employment Insurance Program. Basically if you’re fired without cause there's a layoff or something like that. You can apply and They support you with certain amount. It's a percentage of what you're earning before up to a certain limit. Here's great because it actually, if I didn't have this, this is one of the things this is what I was telling you about taxes and if I hadn't had this, I think would be in Mexico right now. Because we were struggling. We were living on savings like be even even though my wife got a job look like it was a really bad job. Not a bad job was like an entry level job. Almost minimum wage. We had savings and and all that. Toronto is really expensive and you compare it any city in the world, but if you convert to Mexico, it's usually expensive, like back in Mexico. I had a two bedroom apartment and it was paying about, if you converted to Canadian dollars maybe like $400 in a really nice. When we got here we got a one bedroom in downtown for 1600 so it was four times and because that's that's one struggle that we had actually when we got here and actually I think I should mention when we got here we didn't know we didn't know anyone. So, when you apply for to be to rent, place they want you to get a warrant or because you don't have any credit score, any credit history anything. And because we didn't cover until we have to give six months, six months, six months rent. That's a significant amount of money. It was huge for us. It ate not half but about 30-40% percent of our savings. You get it back but promise that you you paid the deposit for. So you get the deposit here. And then this is a year, right? So, in theory, it's six months, right? But you need to create month one, month two, month three, month four, month five, and then the deposit starts counting here. So, you need to pay for six months and then keep paying the rent for the next six months. So, in the lapse of six months, you spent what you would be spending in a whole year. So, and that that sucks. Right now, one of my friends just moved here from his from he was living in Boston. And he was he just moved here, and they were asking you for four months in advance. So, I told him Don't do that. I'll be you want to just please don't destroy the apartment so spoke to me. But I helped him because it's ridiculous when you're moving from a country that it's not this expensive it just it just hurts. It hurts you really bad. We found an option with Scotiabank. Scotiabank has a huge presence in Latin America. So they had an option called smart drivers, it was some program. If you open an account in Mexico, you could move all your money without paying any fees or anything. So what we did we open an account in Scotiabank, Mexico, we just move all our money there. And then the week before we moved here, we just move all the money here. So we didn't pay any fees. That was great. That was one of those great things because if not, then we were basically screwed. That's another thing when I said that its conservative and, you know, elitist. Yeah, because you asking like, okay, you want to move here first, you get points because you have a university degree, you get points because you have experience working, you get points because you all that stuff, you come here to do this thing, you're young, and you need to have money to do this kind of things and all that. So that leaves most of the people who actually need to leave their countries behind. So, I was fortunate enough to have savings, to have a degree to have experience all that, that I was a good candidate for Canada. But if you live in Mexico and you're not by you know, you weren't able to go to school, you weren't able to go to private school and you don't have a good job, you’re screwed.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tNow, what are the sort of next steps for you future? What are you going to do now? Like next steps in terms of migration next steps in terms of life course as well? Like, what are you looking forward to?', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tnext steps like a generic next step like life, professional life, profession, and migration. Yes, I'm trying to apply in January for citizenship. And the reason is because in October, we it's two years. I'm pretty sure you know this, but if you were temporary residents before, you're going to remember, isn't it? You can get like a bonus one year from before. So it's one year from before plus two years and permanent residency. And the idea for me and my wife would be, so this up to so in January 2020 we want to apply for citizenship. So that's the migration thing. After that, I might stay here. I want to stay here. I would like to run every like the city. I really like the quality of life. But then again, it goes to who just saying like you. I love living in downtown, because it's super convenient. But so expensive. It says like, the problem with that is that it goes with what we were saying is that you need a, really, really good job which pays a shit ton of money. So it just goes around with I was saying like, if you have money then you get the best of the city, which I'm fortunate enough to have right now. I just think I've been really lucky with my path here. The job that I got the company I'm with when I joined over less than 20 people. Now we're like 60, and I was able to grow with the company. So, I started as a product manager. Now I'm a senior director. So I mean, I think that's, I was really, really lucky to get that. So that gives me the opportunity to live here to earn enough money to to enjoy Toronto. If you don't have any money, don’t have a good job, you have to live somewhere far like Scarborough and you need to take the Go train in the morning and you need to get here and youre commute is like an hour and a half. Know that. So those kind of things is it just goes back to what I'm saying about it's a really embracing culture in the lab, but it's still very elitist. You need money, you need studies, you need to be young, you need to be a certain type of person to actually enjoy the city. I never wanted kids. So this is now. So, as I said, January 2020, is citizenship. We're planning to buy a home maybe this year hopefully. We've been saving through to for example payment. Again, we want to live in downtown so it's even more expensive than I think so we're looking into I think, because we want at least a one bedroom apartment were you talking about like over half a million dollars so so I saw one that I loved was a two bedroom plus den, two bathrooms was a $1 million plus den. You know what, like the you know, like, for example this in my apartment is you enter here. This is the kitchen. Yeah. And we have a sink here and it's open and then you have kind of like the living room/dining room. And then we have a door here and then we have the bedroom and here is the washer. A den is basically a space where it's open. There's no door. And you can use it as a small office or guest room but it has no door. Okay? That's the definition. It's like, Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be mostly for us. So we're gonna be like a small office. Oh, that's what we're looking looking into it so we want to buy a condo. I wanted to be one bedroom, plus den. That's that's my idea. As I said downtown. That's something that I think we have enough money to for the down payment and start something that Let's see, this is really expensive. Professionally, I like my job. So I'm pretty sure I'm gonna stay there for a while. So I would say by professionally, there's no change. No change. But I'm doing side projects. So that's one of the things that have been missing. I started the podcast, yeah. And then continue with that. My goal is to interview 100 immigrants. Maybe after 100 I give up or not, but that's the goal. It's in two years. I wanted to meet 100 people. And I'm also writing. One of my short stories is going to be published soon. It's It's it's a parody of an immigrant from Mexico. So his name is Jesus because it makes it it's a very common name, but it's spelled Jesus. So, people make fun of his name because they know your name is Jesus in, in an Anglophone country, nobody's going to be named never gonna name the baby Jesus. Jesus is very company. He needs to explain love of Mexico that and then he is getting a job interview for an entry level job, but he's very stubborn and arrogant. So he doesn't want to get an entry level job. He thinks that he's the Big Shot. He's been a year without a job because he's looking for the top. Like, he's gonna He's going for the major leagues, but he doesn't have the skills and nobody wants to hire him. And then he gets divorced. It’s a take a very dark humour. Its being published by the immigrant writers association. So actually, if you listen to my first episode of podcast, I don't know if you listen to you listen to the first one. The first one, I interviewed the founder of that.  So it's funny because I started it just from college, I started taking a vacation program in creative writing. And I started writing that as, as part of the, of the school project. And at some point, I became a member of this association and they launched, they were asking for people to submit their stories for because they want to, they wanted to create the first anthology and it was going to be stories about immigration. Like I already have this. I just need to polish it and send it so I worked with some of my friends from school, polished it and sent it. They liked it. And it's gonna be one of 10 chapters in the book. I started writing of a young age, but I never pursue writing as a career. My mom is a writer, my sisters writer. So for me was just like, normal. I also take, I am like an amateur photographer as well. So, I do a lot of those kind of things. So yeah, that's, that's another thing. I'm going to continue pursuing my writing right now. Right now I'm writing a novel as well. So, I'm going to say novel. Yeah. Most of my short stories are like that. And like, I try to make people laugh, but my novel is a sci fi action dystopian novel. So it's a little different.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\twould you consider migration elsewhere?', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tI could, um, yeah, absolutely. I just would do it a little different. I would. I would be, I guess, I guess the difference right now. I wouldn't be escaping from my country. So if I consider something now, I would think a little more and maybe don't go the way I came like, I left everything and lets see what life gives us here. I think if I move somewhere else I would be a little more careful and be like okay I need a job I'm going to go get a job and it has to be something that is really is fulfilling not like the first job I have something that's fulfilling and but I would consider I would completely consider moving and there's places that I would love to move. Mostly Europe, Europe, mostly UK. I would love to live in the UK. London To be honest, is my favorite city in the world. So that I haven't been so yeah, I would imagine it would be great. I've been there so many times. So many like three before four times. But it's still like you think about me like I I don't come from I my family's not wealthy. That also made the first time I left Mexico. I was 27-28 I never left my country and there was 28 years old.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd where did you go ', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tCuba.And then the next time I left was when I was I got married to my wife. And no, no, before we got married, we wanted to cruise to the Caribbean. So, the second time, and then we got more many more here and then I started traveling a lot. But what I'm trying to say is that traveling is are quite expensive. So I never did it when I was young. I never, I always dreamed about we're going to grab a backpack, I'm going to tour Europe with a bag, but I never did that. So now when I travel, I travel with a backpack but it's different because it's now because I know that I have a job that I'm coming back to a job at the time. It's like I'm just gonna grab a backpack in travel the whole whole Europe and maybe Asia for for a year and see what happens but never never did it. Yeah, but yeah, I would consider migrating but it just would be a little more. I wouldn't say careful because I think it was careful with me here. I think it would be more picky in the sense that it has to be a place that I really want to go, and I need to get a job I really want. And that's like kind of like I actually got a job offer a few months ago for the US, California, And I said no. Two things first, I didn't I didn't want I don't want to leave before I get my citizenship and also in the United States, and it's not a good time to be Mexican in the United States, even though I don't have Mexican. And my accent is, I have an accent but its not that Mexican-ish. So I will be okay. And it's California. I completely get it. But still the US. I don't want to live in a country where you have Trump as president.\", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tI mean, if you if you have nothing else to add, but I suppose I have I always have this final question when people draw a map. How do you feel looking at all of this now?', '', '', '', \"Ol:\\tWell, first I feel…I feel like really happy. I never I mean, I knew I did all this. I knew I applied to all this things. But I'm, its the first time I put it in somewhere and I can see it. It's like, there's so many steps that I did to get where I am now. So yeah, it's like, Wow. I remember it was it was it was very stressful. Every time that my I think the most stressful times was when I lost my job. And I knew I needed to get a job by June, or may or the summer because my work permit was expired. And I  needed to get a job in my field to apply for the NAFTA extension. That was so stressful. And now that I look back I was like, I was like I feel like, it's it's a strange feeling because it's physically like I want to cry because I remember those times I remember how stressful it was but also I remember the time when we got here. And we had we didn't have any furniture and we were sleeping in an inflatable mattress because we were waiting for the furniture to arrive. And like just a feeling of a fresh start was so invigorating. If you look at the picture of me when I arrived, and a picture of me two months before in Mexico City, I look like five years older in the in the in the picture from Mexico City. Like I think the stress in Mexico. You know Everything just made me look way older. Oh my god, I felt so renewed and all that. And I remember thinking, it's like nobody knows who I am here. I can be whoever I want. I have no baggage. I can do anything I want. Yep. And that's feeling I think it was. I think only someone that's actually gone through the migration process knows what it feels like. To look at this and that kind of reminds me this time when we started deciding because which we actually the reason we we started thinking about moving was because I had a company in Mexico we went bankrupt, lost everything so it was like shit, I need something I need a fresh start. So it's kind of tired of the whole thing. So it's just looking at this is just has been quite a journey. Has it been worth it? Yeah. So I mean, that's that that's that's the thing, right that happy at the end of it. So that's good. And yeah, um, look, I mean, I, I don't really have any more questions, you've pretty much covered everything but is there anything that you you think I should have asked that I didn't ask? I suppose the one thing that I do maybe want to talk about, is you providing advice. Do you give migration advice to people? I suppose through your podcast, that's one avenue that you do. I kind of do through podcast but I just started with this good podcast. Before, I'm usually very open to anyone who like for example, someone contacts me through LinkedIn. I always reply and say like, Hey, can we have a coffee? Can you tell me? I just thought I was them at some point. So I know. I know the struggle. I know the desperation that you feel that this is not going the way I wanted it to go. So, Yeah, I'm always open to that. And that's the reason why I started the podcast. Because I wanted to give something back to. I would, I would. I think what I want to say is like, I would want to give back what I would like to have would have liked to have back then when I started the migration process. Like someone, and that's what I'm focusing on the stories of normal people's like, everybody's struggling. You're not the only one with the issues. Yeah, everybody has issues.M:\\tSo let's just begin with when you say Don't worry about this yet. We'll get started later.

My husband, hes here. We had the option of because I had a great career and focus on so we had an option for him to either keep coming down and visiting me while I was working in history in my career. But I just felt that that would be like, you know, we would have been like a year or two into our marriage and then I would move here and it would be like we're starting. I think it would just have mixed up our timeline. So I just decided to create a new year. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAlright, and yeah, what was the work that you were doing that what's your professional background? \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tSo, I work in non-profits. I started one of Pakistan's largest non-profit networks, which is called the free and fair election network which is based on democracy and governance. I worked in that area…the non-profit area for about seven years. I went to the States to study going back to Pakistan. I worked with a corporate for three years and innovation, digital innovation and change management. Then I moved to a news channel Hum News and I joined as an anchor person. But while I was there, I had met my husband, so I realized I probably wouldn't be able to go through and it was wrong to the channel. So, I changed my role.

And I thought I might move but I and I was in Montreal for only three days. So, it was a consideration but my first preference was the states. Right. But once you've left, getting back in with a job is more difficult than yours there as student and continue to find work. But yeah, I think Just it worked out.

Just grew on to me, and then I contacted my work people and everybody and I was just like, I think I'm going to stay here. I don't think I'm going to go back.

You don't have to be on a skilled visa like I clarified before, but how do you consider yourself to be skilled.\", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tYeah, I did. I did do like when I was applying for the immigration initially, I did do the skills thing. So, I think I used to score something like, for Canada, I don't know what the minimum is. But it used to be something like 150 to 160 points, which was well above the average mean. So, I don't know what that means. If that answers your question. Okay, So in that sense, like, because I have a very diversified portfolio of work, so I don't have like, I don't I don't think I'd be able to say like, I have a skill in like carpentry or so but I do have like very strong editorial analytical skills. I have writing skills. I write a blog for one of these non-profits which works on mental health. I'm working with this other non-profit which works with foster children. So I helped to give them life skills such as just being a budget and you know, preparing the resume. So, I have those I have. I have mentoring skills. And so yeah, because I'm more of a generalist, it's something that I can I can fit in a lot of areas, basically. Yeah. So, I don't know, if I start to list them down. I feel like it's gonna be kind of like tooting my own horn. But also I know that it's multifaceted. Right so like I mean domestically I think it's I pretty much do everything I can I change the bulbs. I can I cook I clean? It's a Yeah, I don't think there's except for like heavyweight. I'm pretty adept at everything that goes on in our place. I'm also one of those people who changes like the electricity voltage things and like makes a three pin plug to a two pin plus do that stuff like that. So that and technologically I'm pretty good technologically just get it mixed up. So I like that's a natural inclination to it.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd what's the married life dynamic like living away from home? away from home? \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tI don't think I feel that too much because I just I was very independent when I was home as well. So if you like, yeah, my mom came to visit and that was good. She was here for a couple of months. And that flew by pretty quickly. So I feel like I was already living one person then now I'm still living with one person. It's just different in the sense that this person I'm getting to know more and more every day. Yeah. And because he's a guy and I feel like in all of my childhood, because my father also passed away pretty early on the only male presence, I had was my brother’s. And he also left pretty early on like when I was just 20. So I don't really remember much about guy habits. When I moved here I was very like, interesting to me. And I thank God that I have a brother because when I used to visit his house in London like over the summers I get I'd start to clean up this place and then I'd have to stop myself that I'm on vacation and I'm here to do this. So, women generally I feel like just have a natural inclination to be more organized and more clean or like keeping a place a pretty good. Yeah, so what I moved here like my apartment was full of boxes. And I asked my husband if he just moved in. And he said, No. And he had told me before he came that he was cleaning up the apartment and because the lease was ending, so I thought he packed it up. But it turns out, that's how it used to be like, forever. There was just boxes everywhere. And, and I also realized that he has a very different way of organizing things. So, this is the closet. It's a closet. Now, it doesn't matter if it's in the kitchen, or the room or the bathroom. It's a closet. So, you will find things which will be like, Why is this here? And then you realize it's a closet, it doesn't matter where it is. So, there would be things completely like the kitchen drawer would have like tools in it, and I’d be like shouldn’t this be anywhere else except here. so I realized like it was a bulb which went off in my head when I realized  that for him a drawer is a drawer. It's not where it is. It's just a drawer. It's a place to put things. So he, in general, he does agree that he's a bit weak at organizing, but he but for me, that was a completely new way. So I realized like, and for him, like, if it was messy, and he was fine, you know, he didn't really like even if it was a bit dirty. He was still fine. It didn't really matter to him basically. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\t So and your husband's from Pakistan as well. Yeah. Yeah. \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tBut he lived there for like, I guess. Max 10 years of his life. Yeah, he's been he was in America, and then he moved here. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo awesome. Great. Okay. So we'll go into the mapping part of it. I do want to clarify that at any point, if you don't want to answer something, or you think that you want to remove that from the transcripts, that's completely fine. We can do that as well. Okay. So, all right. So I'll basically as You two questions and you will just draw it out. And then this whole thing will be recorded, and we can talk through you talk through your drawing. Okay? The drawing is completely up to you; however you want to do it. So from the initial sort of point of leaving Pakistan, I I in your case, I suppose it is about going to study as well in the US, right? \", '', '', '', 'Az:\\tWell just to mention I grew up in Africa. So, I moved to Pakistan when I was eight years old. So, for me Pakistan never really felt like home. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tExcellent. So let's put that on the map as well. So let's just talk about all of the places that you've been and all of the kinds of statuses like the visa status that you've been okay, I guess that's Let's begin with that. \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tOkay, so all right. So lets just make like...That's Africa. That is Asia.. Here is your Australia and I have no clue what North America looks like it says this big blob over there. So, here is my.. Botswana. Yeah. And then here would be Pakistan…here is going to be Philly and then we're going to move Montreal so those are the four countries well that's a city where I have lived in USA, Canada should be in red. Okay, so that's that's Africa. Yeah, Asia. So, in Botswana I was there for zero to seven years. Pakistan, I moved in 1992 to 2011 and then from 2013 to 2018. Philly is 2011 to 2013. Canada is 2018 to now. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tExcellent. This is such a great representation and loving it already. So you grew up in Botswana because your family was there?', '', '', '', 'Az:\\tMy father was working there before I was born. my mom was expecting me. So he moved there, and he thought it was was good. and then he was able to call us. So I was still like about three months or so when we moved there.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo yeah. And do you remember like what it was like? ', '', '', '', 'Az:\\tOh yeah, I went back in 2012 to volunteer there. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tOh, you do. So yeah. Oh, that's amazing. Awesome. All right. Okay, now we'll talk about your sort of migration journey. I suppose this might have to do more with your education in the US and also with Canada and moving so I wanted to ask you about commercial services that you used throughout. So, things that you paid for, which are legends, lawyers, document translation services, language tests, internships, anything that you had to pay for in your move, maybe more recently, maybe either Canada or both Canada and us.\", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tOkay, so here [Botswana] it was not paid for. Yeah. Okay. And over here. This part is also not paid for [US]. Yeah, because you're Yes. And this part when I got to get here  - GRE. And the TOEFL. GRE is to get into any school and TOEFL is because even if you had an English medium education, you're going from Pakistan so they need to be able to tell. So at some point, though, I know that I did take the IELTS X 2. Once way earlier when I was thinking of immigrating to Australia in around 2009, I think okay. And once I took it right now, when I was thinking of coming to Canada So I was twice because that's a requirement for Yeah. And then when I moved to Canada, we consulted with the lawyer twice. But I did all the paperwork myself. So just a lawyer fee, which was, I don't know, $200 for 100 for every time so it wasn't too much. So yes, but every country I have visited in my life. Yes. Okay. Visits is equal to visas paid for. And that would be about – because it’s a Pakistani Passport. So I pay for every country's visa, right. So it's going to be at least.. I paid for at least like 30 countries..30 times. So that's a cost, but I have never consulted anybody for paperwork. That's only in Canada – background checks. Because of my immigration. That's all because to the US, I was on a scholarship from the US Department. So, I got waived for a lot of the costs than anybody else was going to the US to study…they would have many more of the loops and hoops. So, for me till now it's the lawyer, the police, The medicals, not yet, if they asked me it's not necessarily for everybody. When you do your PR it's a spousal one so it depends. Some people …they skip. Oh, yeah, I did do it. For the Australian visa I did do the medical test for the visit visa. No, they made my mom do it. Not me. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, and what about the immigration to Australia? Like, did you like what happened to that? Cuz considering that you were thinking a move in 2009 I got the in 2010. ', '', '', '', 'Az:\\tIn 2010 I got the scholarship. So that fell through. ', '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay. All right. We'll move on then. Tell me about the role of technology in your migration. And what I mean is everything that you use tech for. So online searches, what resources you used, what social media you used, your own a particular groups. Also what technology you use. Today maybe to navigate in a new place you know.\", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tSo, all of this - 1999 onwards is all tech dependent. If there wasn’t tech, especially in particular internet, I wouldn't be here basically. So what I use right now - let's go backwards because it's more fresh - Now I use Facebook for Canada spousal group, spousal support group. Its excellent. Nobody posts any junk on there. Then theres an online support group. These guys on online support group you can just post a random question and but you may or may not get an answer back I'm forgetting what the name is but it's anonymous support group “apply Canada immigration” something like that yeah some days it comes up as a first search what you do it. After moving here or even before moving here so always flights are always looked up online, flighthopper is a great tool, visa requirements are always looked up online, college applications, full bright application, undergrad, all of that work, Almost, except for the employments I created myself on the, job applications. Even like when you find your way just general maps Yeah. Kajiji for a lot of shit. Even if like right now like the blog I work for a link to community management stuff that I do. I helped organize it's all Online. So, it's because I'm new in the city and I don't know many people. So, everything that we are finding and my husband is more of an introvert he doesn't know a lot of people. So, everything I do is like, by going online, do it. So if I didn't, that's what I feel like I feel like if I don't even understand how women did this by doing these moves before us. Like I don't know what they went through because they'd write home a letter in the received one like a month later. So I just absolutely have this amazing respect for what they’ve actually been through. If you're depressed. Are you looking for something else? You do this? You know? That's where you turn to either. Just place a search. The world's at your fingertips? Absolutely. So for me if there's no net, there's no life, basically.  I mean, I met some people somebody, like, met through the net. I found like a job fair. I'm coming back and I'm going forward. So on the job for found one, I made one lead and went to one of their sessions. And that led to two leads. And that's how I think it goes through basically. So that's one and then one of the social works that I do. I found it was recommended by a friend who knew about them – Vent over tea. I love this place. Its mental health places. Basically, you go online, you book a venting session with somebody who's trained in active listening and you get an hour. I write a blog for them. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd do you think that language plays a role here because considering that Montreal being a very French part of town…', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tI think when you're new here you think that French is absolutely essential. As you leave here more and more you realize it's not that essential. You see job opportunities and you get disheartened because most of like all of them always say bilingual, but you realize that through experience that is by law, there are required to write that on job descriptions. When they write bilingual they are actually looking for somebody who speaks English. So, but I have learned French. I am still learning and I manage to have a basic conversations like shopping in French, I can talk to people, I can tell directions, like shop for groceries or anything I need. So yeah, I think I've picked up the language\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tGreat okay and where do you learn French? ', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tOh, so first I was here at the YMCA for like two months and then I realized it wasn't helping me much. Then I joined one of the we works and that was all right. Now I move towards more government different places so I go to of archives national Quebec what's called a bank OBNQ. So, I go there for classes which are free once a week, which are only in conversation for French. And then I do at Dawson college, I go Mondays Tuesdays. The Dawson ones are not free, but they're almost like, what they asked for is very small. When I went to the summer, to the ones which the government offers, they told me my work permit did not qualify for it because it's an open work permit. But somebody I met just now. [Draws] This has saved my life. One of the persons told me that now they do accept it. So because she has just started it. So I feel like the meetup groups really helped. Again, I think if there weren’t meetup, I wouldn't have found a lot of people in a lot of places. The friends I did make though, I found them in my French classes. And so I just feel like the one or two people, friends in recommended, like, oh, you're going to Montreal. You know my sister lives there. And I was already a bit like, because I know me and my sister were poles apart. So, if somebody is her friend, most likely they're not gonna my friend and vice versa. Somebody who recommended me their sister and when I met her, I was just like, I'm friends with you, not your sister. I just it's not necessary. But another friend of mine, his sister moved here and we got along pretty good. So I think it has to do with the fact that he's a male and she's a female. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo I mean, I thought was kind of going to go into the next question that I had is about social connections so friends, family or greater community that have supported you in your move here. And if there's anything that from there that you want to put on your map\", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tSo I feel like I am a very independent person. I have always been a very independent person and everybody was, more than advice, everybody was very sure that I'd make friends in no time and then again, you know, I'd be on my feet. When I moved here, I thought I would need friends. But initially, I didn't want to be friends, like look up or go seeking friends. Like, I just wanted to be on my own. Because it was not just a physical, geographical change, but it was also change in my marital status. So I wanted to, you know, understand the dynamic of this relationship I was going to be in. Nobody hands you a JD for how to be a wife. What is it going to be like. And you just pretty mimic what your parents did. That’s the only training manual you have. So, I feel like it would be very helpful if my husband has been more supportive, okay. And I feel like he should have had some tools to help him understand what I would go through…for example, well, because he has his life going on here. And, of course, nobody's asked to reorganize all his life here. But he, to understand that his presence would be important, and in a meaningful way, not just being physically present mentally absent. So I feel like something like that would have been very helpful for me. And if he had, I do believe that if he had known about a resource like that, he would have reached out to me before I came, so that just give me an idea.\", '', '', '', \"[I'm gonna make a start up along those lines. So I'm thinking about multiple things think that you can use this paper if you want. Okay? Actually, I do keep making notes. So I'm just because I create things myself. That's what I do.]\", '', '', '', \"So I think that's a great resource as well as for anybody who's new, for partners. So before they come in here, because it's it's like I had to find everything, you know, and because I'm a woman, like he just showed me like, heres the pharmacy, heres the grocery store. And the rest was just like, I'm going back to work. So who do I meet? Like, you know, and I feel like also because his and my personality styles are so different. Like, within one year, I feel like I've almost made more friends than he would even like to have, you know what I mean? Because he doesn't have many friends and his friends are not necessarily going to be my friends. And I would rather not because I would like him to have his time doing his thing. So yeah, so I think that it's just really important that does have to be and for me, I didn't know who to reach out to, if I needed support. So even when I went online, I didn't like and it's also I think some of the part of you doesn't really want to admit that you want support. Yeah. So you're, you're not willing to do that in the beginning. So yeah, so it's like any place it's not easy to move to a place when you when you're somebody who's used to having a like a full schedule, and like work, you know, all engines burning basically. And then you just move in this all really down to zero and you also have a perception that it's all French. But it's not. But for me, I like the French perception because it's kind of pushed me into learning a language I always wanted to learn anyway. And for me, it's not just to learn language I can get along it's for me to it's more like to read more books or literature in French and actually get an understanding because it just opened up a whole new world so I already do write like small stuff in French and I manage all right, because I write stories so I write those in French and I find myself thinking in French already. So yes, so language does play a role and I feel like either you would embrace it or let it deter you, and it's all up to you. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd did you actually have these conversations with your husband that, you know,', '', 'like in terms of support and in terms of ', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tYeah, I feel like he does agree that he could have done a better job, but how he could have done it. He could he doesn't know. And so I don't blame him for that. We’re both lost. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tBut anyway, alright, cool. Um, how did your decision to move? But I suppose you've kind of answered that before. But do you have a very close connection with your family? And did that affect your mom, for example, that you were moving and \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tMy mom somebody who's like, I know that it didn't affect her, but she had, even when I was there, she had a routine. She has a very strong network of friends and family and she's she's…And she did 2 years without me any way. Two years without me when I was in the States. So she kind of like, already knew that. But the thing is, when I was in the States, she was still working. And she retired the year I got back. So, for her, but she still is very regimented. So, she’ll get up at a certain time every day. She has her whole routine. So even when I was in Pakistan, like, if I came back from work earlier, she was like, okay, you're home, but I have things to do. So, we're going to sit together at the time we sit together every day. So, like, and that was good to see because it just showed me that she's going to be fine without me and she is so she's a very, she's a she's a very strong and she's she's because she's so independent. She's always promoted us to be like, you know, raised us to be very independent individuals as well. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo that's great, okay. All right. So I suppose the mapping part of it is is kind of done.\", '', 'I do have some more questions that you can potentially think about putting on your map. First, these regulatory aspects of your migration you did talk about police checks and you have put it already but any other government requirements that you have to fulfill so characters or points or health or immigration forums or anything that was kind of very government based that you had to let do get ', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tWe did have to get like there was one stamp on our because we got our Nikanama in English as well. But there was one stamp in Urdu which we got translated. So, and the guy was like, very sweet. He's didn’t even charge us for it. We didn't even know him. We found him online. But he just said, we also wrote for him but the translation was, so he just had to stamp it. That was here. I mean, we did have to go through Of course, we had to do the PR papers, the PR paperwork and the work permit paperwork. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tSo the PR paperwork and the work so what's your status now? Are you on a work permit only or PR? \", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tMy PR is approved in principle. Its called AIP and work permit is to 2021 which means my extension to stay and stuff I have my driver's license, health card everything by now. It took it's time, but it's here now. The paperwork itself is this one is the worst paperwork I've done in my life. I could have applied to five universities in that one paperwork – that’s how much it was because we've been married for less of less than a year when we applied we had to actually prove that this was a legitimate real marriage. It wasn't just done for the sake for getting an immigration. So, we had to give them like photos and they have a cap on photos so we had to be really like smart about the kind of… we had to thik really out of the box in terms of what we give them.. like actual evidence so like we give them photographers contract for the wadding, we gave them permission slips for wedding shoots. The good thing about Pakistan is now that it's pretty becoming pretty regimented and people give you like receipts of the cake, the wedding catering, and everything. So, we had that, and  everything's in English. So we gave them the gym membership for here and then you know that we're both coming here together, opening a bank account they needed…they had absolutely required a joint bank account and me being on a Pakistani passport on a visit visa none of the banks was actually giving us that because they're just like, No, we don't give it to visitors even for joint, so that was like such a catch 22 because we just kept going round and round and I didn't even know which banks were here and then just searching that and thinking out of the box kind of thing. And I basically I think I thought of that only because I had lived in the US and I thought okay they should be able to give me a bank account based on my own nationality and sort of my visit visa and that's how I thought of like an International Bank. So this paperwork’s a bitch, I swear, we have had so many fights and doing this and almost when I went on the support group page, all couples have had fights doing this so we were thinking they should put a checkbox underneath and saying, how many fights did you have one completing this because you're not gonna do this for anybody unless you really love them to be honest. It's that bad. And even though I’m doing inland I think Outland I don't know how land is because you stay away from your spouse most likely for like two years and that is probably hell added on hell. For us because I was hearing a reason you can only set stay at six months stretch. So the deadline was approaching. So it was more like we do this or goodbye. So we were able to like keep our eyes on the prize in terms of like, No, we mean more than the paperwork. This is a mountain a molehill, and a mountain in the way, and because we've been another long distance relationship for six months before we got married, so we, we'd already done that, and we didn't want to go through that again. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tAre you are you on top of immigration policies do follow news, the regards to immigration policies? And do you have anything to say about that? No, no, I didn't really follow them. I was.\", '', '', '', \"Az:\\tNo, I don't, I don't really unless they do something like crazy. I don't really follow it too much. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay, great. And I suppose you did kind of mention this, maybe this might have been your biggest challenge. But overall, throughout your journey, looking at your map, what was some of the biggest challenges or obstacles that you would want to point out and put on your map.', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tI feel like in getting here I was pretty okay because I was already like, pretty sick of where I was and I knew that I had to move so in getting here there was not like, for me it wasn't an obstacle to choose like, Oh, you know I love this place too much and I cant give it up. It never felt like home to me and I was perfectly fine moving away. So, and surprisingly the only city in the in my entire life I've lived in four as you can see, and Montreal has actually felt like home pretty instantly. But I feel like the biggest obstacle I felt when I got here was because I have seasonal affective disorder. And the fact that the winter here is pretty harsh and as much as I love the winter actually, s.a.d, plus, my husband's I don't know, lack of awareness of I don't even know how to put it in a good way like, because I don't blame him for it, that's the thing and I don't hold it against him. But his kind of like the fact that his ignorance and him having a full load of work kind of like timed at the same time as winter hitting in, you know, so because his work is very seasonal. And this and the next semester are his main two semesters. So, I feel like his his business or his life carrying on basically which I cannot absolutely grudge the person or Yeah, so his business plus sad so the timing of that was probably like the worst combination. Yeah. And this year, like as it starts to become when you get close to winter, I almost dread it because it's almost traumatic to think that this cannot be a repeat of the last year. Yeah, right. So see, so a lot of people just say that we have winter blues. All right, okay. Right. But then people who have seen winter blues is something like almost everybody faces because the sun is nowadays are getting shorter to get less sun time and everything. But seasonal affective disorder is when people actually almost move into a depressive state. And you have to like, like I had learned to manage it in Pakistan as well because I would you know, up the ante on my physical activity and everything but here there were some essential vitamins which I wasn't aware of, and I should have started taking them…I should have started way earlier. So, I feel like that affected because they affect the chemistry of you. So that and the fact that you know, I didn't know anybody, so I didn't have a motivation to get out of the house. So, I mean, I mean, when it's snowing everybody wants to stay in any way. Right. And it's beautiful from inside, but I feel like it's beautiful outside as well. But if only if you have like, a purpose to get out, yeah, I just didn't have a real and like for me because I mean, I was living right here is a good thing and a bad thing. Because if I had to go to the gym, I would just run from there to here. Right. So I didn't even have to wear any winter gear on something. I just sprint and I'd be in here then I just went out. But I came here I went to the gym. I didn't really talk to anybody. And the fact that I had very low human interaction, and somebody like me who's extroverted really needs a lot of human interaction. So that and then so the human interaction factor, like very decreased and then the time zone change because everybody back home was like, 12 hours at a difference from you. Yeah so even if I go on everybody it like my friends and you know the fact that you know you you're not there and you see lives moving on basically. Yeah, you have that's the negative of Facebook, and social media that you're able to see things happening and you're not there. it's a con in that sense, the connection is not there. Like, your friends are meeting up the way they used to, like you see their stories. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAny bad advice - In your move through your move after move?', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tYeah, I think everybody was kind of like now that you mentioned like, I've never really thought of like any advice I got. But when you mentioned it, like, I don't think I got good or bad advice. I just didn't get advice. And I think that that itself is not a good or bad thing. Like it may be more of a bad thing, because I just didn't get any advice. I think I feel like either. Everybody just looks at me and thinks that knowledge. Yeah, because I've learned from a very young age to steer my way. So, either everybody's perception of me Is that she should be fine or are they just don't know what to say. So yeah I don't think. I feel like there should have been some something. I feel like my sister in law was had moved to London from to be with my brother. And she like only now like after a year she mentioned that yeah, it feels like you're just you're just reborn you have to do all these driving test again you have, you're basically starting your life is scratch and I feel like, something, a conversation along those lines with somebody would have been helpful. And any of his friends wives that I met, were also not too forthcoming. Now they are not earlier because they didn't know me, or they didn't know him too well. And they didn’t know what to say basically. So, so I feel like it would have, I just feel like there wasn't much conversation happening. That's why I'm taking notes because I am considering of building this on on a side of talk to one of these organizations as well, where I can actually hold workshops and have mentors and stuff. So I’m thinking of doing something for women who are or even men who are place like me. I feel like I've got like so much like, that's what my first blog was about, like how to prepare for the winter, that's exactly what it says. It's about winter blues, basically. But I there's a disclaimer about SAD at the bottom. So, it's basically trying to give those tips to people that I do do now and that have worked for me. Yeah, so it's so I do find a way to like, say those things and communicate them because I just feel like if I had that information, it would have been much more helpful for me. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd I suppose now do you do you ever plan to bring any of your family members here like your mom?

But I feel like my brother is also more intent on taking her there. So I'm just waiting till I get my PR and I'm able to sponsor somebody. She’ll get more points for her brother being here. He cant sponsor her, I can. So, I'll just I'm just waiting it out to see what the situation is. Yeah, but right now we're a bit like okay, because we know she has a multiple visit visa for the next eight years. So at least that's good.

It's like I was sleep deprived. I was working like crazy. So I went to London on my spring break to be my brother. And he arrived at 7am. He took me for breakfast, went to work. I went to sleep at 10am at 3pm I'm getting like a message from him saying, Are you okay? What's wrong with you? Like, I just fell asleep. He's like, yeah, it's 3pm The next day, the next day, my God, wow. I was like, Oh my god, I have so much work to do. But I needed that sleep. I'm a nocturnal person just yeah, I'm a very productive at night. Oh that's great so that's why I stay up like three or four and I'm getting a lot of stuff done but also my sleep is less like four hours of sleep and I am good. I can also break it into two and two. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tI’m interested in what you generally feel about your map.', '', '', '', \"Az:\\tI'm not too sure if this is actually really reflective of all the things I have actually paid for. Okay, you know, and I think that's an important part because these things are expensive. It's not like they're not expensive. Yeah, you know, just the fees itself is very expensive for the paperwork. But like, I feel like so for me, something that I like about myself is that my education, my entire education, which is 18 years or so, has almost except for two years, it has all been free. So I think that is not like something which other people get. And good education especially right, like I went to an Ivy League school. Yeah, a private school like that. It's, it's so coming out of that debt free, you know. So, the only two years I paid for was two out of four years on my undergrad when I was not on scholarship. So, but I feel like if you don't have all of that education, you would pay much more for it. In all the things that I have done, and a lot of my trips have been paid for. Of the 30 countries I've visited, I didn't pay for those airfares. Most of them were paid visits, either through my work, or through my school or something else. So, because you're educated, you know how to get things. You know what I mean? Like if you want something but you don't have the money at that time, but you have a very big asset, which is education and awareness. And you find somebody who's gonna pay you to do that. I really wanted to go back to Botswana. After like 20 years, having left it as a child. And I went to Penn, I saw the Penn as a Penn and Botswana partnership. I applied for the summer internship and I could have checked all the countries in the world on that actually, and I only checked Botswana and I said, this is the only one I want to go to. If not, I'm going to stay back and I had two internship offers in Philly and I said I'd stay back and I do that. And then they contacted me and said your waitlisted, not shortlisted. Would you like to be waitlisted? I said to myself, hmm waitlisted means no, but I said, I'll take that chance. And, and that's what happened. Somebody jumped out and I made it, you know, I went. So, my 3 months over there were paid for it. You know, so what I'm just trying to say is somebody else would have to pay much more, even if I paid for those visas in many cases. I didn't. even pay for the visas. It was coming from somewhere else. So, I'm just saying that this cost is not reflective of more than average people. This is like an outlier in terms of cost. My brother in law he has, I don't know if this will help you in any way. But he's working on internet for all access, like his mission is to make the entire world have free access to internet, based in San Francisco, and he went to the US on the “genius visa” was the genius visa. It's given to Absolutely exceptional people is a very few brother in law as in your brother in law, my husband's sister's husband, husband, sister's husband, okay. So he, he is he actually is a genius and he was he works with all the start-ups and everything inbox on as well. And so kind of uses like he's our age, but he is a phenomenally inspirational person. That's amazing. So that is his goal. And this this awareness is something that he brought to me that a lot of people, a lot of things I do is only because I have access to internet Yeah, just not having access to them, but also knowing how to use it. Absolutely. So that is an absolute privilege…that's why I just wanted to like give that disclaimer at some point that of the GRE, I took the GRE four times. How many times did I pay for it out of pocket, two times? The only trip I paid for, for the first time in my life was my own Umrah trip in 2009. Before that, I'd been to the US to Nepal to like, other Australia, all these other countries that I'd gone to. They're all paid for by somebody else.

He hasn't travelled as many states even though he’s lived longer than me. Even in Canada. I have visited more places than him. Some of the places he’s visited, I haven't like Europe. Yeah.

There is some more and more French Osteopaths in Canada because it's the place where we can work with our French Diploma. I just have to have an association here from my French diploma, but its like a separate subscription. And I'm just going to work with my French diploma. So it's really good because the French schools are really good for Osteopathy than in Canada. I think, maybe not. Better. I don't. Those are better or not.

So I think then I did a lot of search on the internet. And there is a website, a French website already good one to a lot of information about the working holiday visa. And then also on the website of immigration, Canadian, immigration, but more on the other side. I just know that I didn't want to go to Montreal and Quebec because there was too much French people and I don't want to be only with French people and then I didn't decide Toronto.

So whatever the country, if I speak English it doesn't matter for me but Toronto it's a really good city for what my job but there was a lot of stuff to do. It's not so far from America. There is a good airport if I want to travel so it's a good combination. Actually, I work in two clinics, so I decided to live at the middle.

So, it was a really good find because everything is new, and I just have to pay for my food, and everything is included in the price for the apartment. So, it was really good for me, but now I meet my roommate, and it's everything is really good. And maybe we are going to change to pay cheaper, because it's a little expensive, but to start, it was the best decision for me.

Little by little Canada open more places because they want lots of people to come. This is for France. Yes. If I wanted to go to Australia, I just have to pay and go. But for Canada, It's a draw.

So, there is an age it's 35 but You just have to sit and wait you're lucky like me you get it if not you're still waiting. So, I was very lucky. And then after getting my visa we have lots of paper to do like to give information about me, about my family, even my brothers, my job so I have to make medical visits because I have to work with babies and lot of patients so I have to pay expensive for this visits. So, I needed to go to a different province for my visit [medical]. I need to go to Leon for my biometrics, yeah, it was step by step. And I think in April, it was done.

And they are like “Oh, okay”. And I saw that were not happy because I think if I say three or six months, they consider that I don't want to be to take care of them.

If people come back in two or three weeks, then if they come back in six months, I don't do the same. It's not about techniques, but it's just about how I see my practice now. I adapt myself, for people in Canada. And I think if I go back to France, I have to adapt again for people in France. So it was very different, but I don't prefer France or Canada for that.

Of course I think about that because I'm a girl but I feel so much insecurity, here than in France. So, I really feel comfortable now with that. And my brother move with his wife and his daughter, so yes, he moves to Boston but he is not alone. If he needs to support he can just go home and he has support.

And I have a big apartment and I was alone because my roommate was not there. So yeah, it was to be alone – in every part – work, at home, outside. Now I feel better after one month. I feel better.  I feel safe in Toronto more than France because when I was studying in Lyon, if I were as well, I don't wear skirts, but a short.. just a short. I know that I will have some… I don't know the word.. well I can't wear what I want in Lyon. I always was thinking about oh, what's going people say, because I'm wearing wearing a short or a skirt? Because they are crazy. They are not open minded and if a girl has a short, it's means that she wants for example sex. Lyon is a big city, but it's like…. it will be the same in Paris. There is types of people of course, but in Lyon it was very difficult sometime because I go.. I will were short and I know that I will have some words on the streets and everything. When I have insults of some people, it was from one community, but you don't have that in Toronto. I can wear what I want. I can make up as I want, I can go to city in a bikini if I want, I will not have any insults or remarks. If you do that in France, Oh my God. Do you know scum? Like that community? That's it was very strange because sometimes you go in a place and you will not expect you to have some insults and you do. So, if at my parents home, it's a small city, so it was not all the time, just sometimes. But in big city if you go to some place, you know that you are not so safe. I really feel safe here.

But without music just to show that people that I can't listen, but actually I listen if something happened. In Toronto, I just came at midnight Thursday, and I feel really safe. No they don’t. May be they want because maybe they miss me. But especially my mom, because I'm very close to my mom. But if my mom knows that I'm up here and if everything is going well, she will never ask me to come back. I have news for all my family maybe every day because we have a group on WhatsApp and it's really easy now with the technology. So it was not like years ago, but they are coming just to visit me to to see how I live, where I live, where I work, and how is the city just to discover my new life.

They did, did that play a part?', '', '', '', 'B:\\tNo, because I did a lot of stuff before arriving in Toronto. Like for my work, for all my insurance depot mine and receive everything was done before arriving here. For example for my bank of my phone, my mobile phone or something. I did everything on my own. And my boss told me if you need help, you can just ask me. So no I did it all alone.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay and insurance did you have to pay for insurance?', '', '', '', \"B:\\tNo, it's only my insurance for my work. And for my medical insurance, I keep my French insurance if something happen, and I have to, yes, I have to pay one but it's with my working holiday visa. Oh right, I have to add that. And it's insurance and this insurance is a partner with Pvtiste. Yeah, there was lot of insurance you have to choose between what you're supposed to need. And I took this one because a lot of people take this one and it was better for what I suppose visit here and it was 800 euros for two years. And for exam Oh, I also like this one because if I only stay one years, they reimburse me. But if I took another one you pay more expensive and they didn’t reimburse. And you don't take for two years your insurance, when you arrive on Canada, they didn't give you your visa for two years. Only one year. So you have to get for two years. Then if you only want to stay for one year, you can ask your insurance to return the money back. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tIn terms of your professional networks Tell me like are you friends with people who work? How was the work environment? Are you like how are you finding the professional?', '', '', '', \"B:\\tI felt really good. But actually, I don't… I work in 2 clinics. One clinic I see is there is there is maybe eight rooms… there is naturopath, massage therapists, acupuncturist, psycho therapies. But if I have a lot of patient and if they have lot of patients, I don't see anyone. I just cross them in the clinic but that's all but everyone is really kind. Sometime we make some after work plans together and the evironment is very good and peaceful and I feel really comfortable. The first time I arrived, my boss said, Okay, we're going to do some shop. I want you to feel comfortable in your room. So we have bought some pictures put on the wall. And I said, Wow it will never appear in France. No. So it was really I feel really comfortable and at my ease. And it's the same in the other. And if I have patient most of the time, I see only my patient. Sometimes I go see my boss if she's not working. But I'm really good and at my ease in the two clinics.\", '', '', '', '', '', \"M:\\tAnd would you move anywhere else?

Yeah, but that was the that was the other place that you would like to go to?\", '', '', '', \"B:\\tTo move and to work there? maybe Netherlands? because I got family in Netherlands and some friends, but I don't speak Dutch but speaking English, so I suppose that my English will be better in few months. So it's not gonna be a problem and ready open minded I goes a lot there…well, not a lot of time but sometimes and people are really kind. And I know that I can feel comfortable there. Except Netherland, in Spain. if I can work in Australia, why not. And for Australia, if I can’t work as an osteopath, maybe I can do something else. Yes. It's not a problem for me to try anything else and maybe just a break of six months or one year to discover something else, to discover another country and a new job, I think still in the care of people but something else. Australia, Netherlands, Spain. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOkay, and tell me about your future plans like what's the next steps?\", '', '', '', \"B:\\tGood question. It's only day after day for me. I don't have any pressure about staying or leaving. I just enjoy the moment. I don't want to tell myself Oh, you have to stay two years because your visa is for two years. As a beginning, I think I would put lot of pressure on myself and say, Oh, you have your visa. Some people are still waiting for one. You have to stay two years, and I was ready stressed for that. And now I say okay, you have work. You have an apartment. Everything is going well. If she wants your permanent resident, you can ask in one year and I will see what is going on. So, I can't say really what I will do in one year, maybe I will be still in Canada, maybe not.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo with the permanent residents, have you looked at the requirements of that at all?

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ma:\tThe main motivation was, like, I wanted to challenge myself. I mean.. Ive been working for 12 years – always in India, or was in middle east for a year. In 2017 I happened to go to UK for a while and then when I came back, and when I wanted to go back to UK, somehow it didn’t end up working out with my employers and then I had a friend over here in Australia. I spoke to them and he was like, give it a shot. If it works out, it works out. I don’t want it to be a situation where in 5 years down the line I’d be thinking – I had an opportunity or I had a chance, and I didn’t take it. So that was one of the reasons. The other motivation was like.. so being married for like 5 years, I was sort of thinking if we plan a family, or whenever we start planning a family, if we have a base in a secure or better environment, well get good benefits out of it. And also the passport advantage that Australia has, or the government benefits that anyone gets over here. I mean like, back in our country, you know the facilities we get – be it education, or medical benefits we get, or the advantage that the Australian passport has – so that 3,4 reasons were the motivations. The major motivation factor for me was my wife. She was like, I think you are saturated over here. You need to try something new and that’s where we started. And it worked out for us, like, the eight-10 months we were. We started the process and within 10 months we were here. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tThat’s very quick. What pathway did you take? Was it skilled migration. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ma:\tIt was skilled migration. So when we started the journey, my friend was one of the main motivation or motivator for me to try it out. So back in India, I used to trade in stock market as a past time. I made money, I lost money. So the way my friend convinced me was – you would have lost like 50 grand easily in stock market. Why not spend 50,000 for this – do your skills assessment and give a English test – be it IELTS or be it Pte – so why to spend 50k and see if you can score a good, if you can get a good assessment, why not try it out. So that’s how we started. So started collecting all my experience documents relating to it. So then, last – so back in India, I had my 12 years of experience – I worked with like 6 different employers and like fortunately, I had a very good relationship with both of them. And I spoke to them and I said that I need an assessment roles and responsibilities letter from you stating that this is the role that I did, and this is the responsibilities I had and I worked full time – whatever format I need. And we got that letters within 10-12 days. Its like I was fortunate enough that all my managers or managers in that point in time were still there in the organisation. I just had to drop a mail, give them a call and they were like okay. So, the first question they asked me was – what do you want in that letter? I was like I have already given you. You just have to validate that and give it to your HR. If youre fine with the format and whatever I have written into it, then you can go ahead and tell your HR and get it signed and send it back to me, or Ill come to collect it, if theres a need. Since I had a very good relationship with them, they were more than happy to do that stuff. And yeah, as I said in 12 days I got all the letters.  The other thing was cracking the English test. I was, like, deciding between PTE and IELTS test. So, I did some search, spoke to couple of friends, went to migration forums, understood which one is easier to crack. Then decided that PTE is the one because one can fool computer algorithm and crack the exam, but.. When I say ‘fool’, its just that, you don’t have to right or wrong – you just have to pronounce few words in a particular way and the algorithm will understand that yes, this person can speak in native English. In IELTS there is a person sitting in front of you. He or she may be biased. He or she may not like what you are saying. Or he or she may judge you based on the way you are communicating, even if you are giving the right answer, they may say that the person is not understanding. Whereas for a computer, you just have to say things in a way that the algorithm wants to hear it. And with some practice tests…and… first attempt, I didn’t crack it, I mean, I didn’t get the score that I wanted. Second attempt, I got the score. Then I did the, by that time I got the ACS assessment done, and it assessed all my working years as a relevant experience. So, I happened to be with highest age points, highest experience points with English score. \n",

      "M:\tWhen you said passport advantage, what do you mean by that?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ma:\tSo like, for example with an Indian passport, I have to apply almost every country in the world to get entered or even for a visitor visa. But, with an Australian passport, there are certain advantages. Like, for example, like, every Indian or every sub-continent guy has a dream of working in US, and day by day, it is getting difficult. Australia has an e3 migration clause with the US which has about 10k migrants, I mean, they can take about 10,000 skilled migrants which only gets filled by 1/4th every year, from Australia to US – people applyimg for work permits etc. So, US has a streamlined arrangement with Australia where they allow like lets say, for H1B, they have a pool for 10,000 lets say. In the same way Australia has, lets say, 5000, which, out of it, only 1000 gets filled. So even if you read todays newspaper, US is trying to give that share, or whatever pending quota, to Ireland. So now, lets say. So, Ill give you an example of my friend, who took an Australian passport and applied for a US thing, and hes now in US. He took like 6 years time to get to US, but now he can work indefinitely, I mean some sort of arrangement wherein he doesn’t have to go via H1B or something. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo would you like to work in the US, or are you just interested in opening opportunities?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ma:\tOpening opportunities. Like, it widens your door. I mean you can go anywhere in the world, and work, or visit, or do anything. I mean like for example – I can give you a recent example. A funny thing happened. My sister and her family were supposed to visit us over here, in 2nd week of May. But their visa got rejected for the stupid reason like, um, there’s no, um, there’s no definite ties with India. I mean they are not going to go back. I mean, they said there is no surety that you will go back. I mean like, shut up. They showed a very good bank balance, they had a return ticket showing that they were gonna go back, they have a settled business over there. But still they didn’t get it. I am literally shocked. I mean my nephews and nicer – they were crying over there. Theres no option of appealing it – in tourist visa. You have to reapply it. So now, with an Indian passport, they struggled. So for example now, if I want to travel with an Australian passport, Ill be taken with arms open. I mean I don’t have to worry at all of getting a visa. I get an on-arrival visa from 100% countries. \n",

Right now, I work for an in-house IT team where I am one level below to what I used to do. But yeah, im in my field. The kind of work I used to do, I am doing that.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Ma:\tI did an analysis. I considered all the various options available, like, coming to Australia was one of them. Going to Canada was one of them because I have my aunt staying over there. So, I can get an additional relative points and I could easily go over there. But I didn’t consider Canada just because it was too cold over there. There was an option of Germany where I can get a 6 months temporary work permit, where I could go over there, find a job, find a sponsor, and I could get a work permit over there. Or a temporary permanent residency over there. Then the 4th option was about moving to the middle east. I mean, it was always open. I mean, twice or thrice I rejected the options that I had – moving to the middle east for a bigger role or bigger opportunity. I didn’t feel comfortable over there because of the restrictions it had. Like, I have to be, like, I was there for a week in Saudi Arabia and I was like, terrified. I cant even take a picture of myself. If someone is there in my background, they might come and just ask me. So, I was there in Dubai. I liked Dubai a bit. The only thing, like I was apprehensive coz lets say one fine day, my employer says I cant, I don’t want you to work over here anymore. I have to again find a sponsor or else I have to come back. Like, I have seen cases where people have worked for 15 years, their kids were born over there but they have to come back. I didn’t want that to happen with me. I wanted something, like wherever we go, we stay. And also the other thing was, the parents thing. I mean, I thought about, like, if we move to Australia, theres a possibility that I can take my parents, which, I don’t think that Canada had that option, there were some conditions. And also weather wise, like my mom has high BP and some sort of heart thing so I thought she might not be able to adjust over there. Like 5 years down, like 2 years down the line, I want my parents to come over here – be it on, any sort of visa. \n",

      "Ma:\tSo, my dad is a very hard working guy. We used to stay in like what, a 100 sq foot place. I was born and brought up in Mumbai. Me, my parents, my grandmother, my sister – so 5 of us staying in 150 sq ft place. They struggled hard. My mom and dad ensured that me and my sister gets the best of education. So because of my dads learning and experience, he played a key role in terms of deciding the way I think about things, or the way I see things. And my wife, like, last 6 – yeah we will be completing 6 years years in a few weeks. So yea in last 6 years she has played a very important role in terms of calming me down or, asking difficult questions to me, like whether you want to really do it, whether youre happy. Shes been a very good support system for me in the last 6 years. Even for coming over here – I was a bit scared, so she was like do you really wanna do that? I you don’t want to, you don’t have to do that. And then she was like, lets take a chance. Lets see what things has in store for us. And were here – in 7.5 months we have a job – both of us have a job, we bought a car. Wife’s into day care. Because she likes being around kids. By the way, shes an interior designer by profession but she didn’t want to study over here again. So, last work she did back in India was working with a day care. So, she was very comfortable with the kids. So, she was ready to study about day care and getting cert 3 in daycare or diploma in child care. But not about interior desigining because she was like, Ive given up. She worked for like 4 or 5 years as an interior designer and she was like im pissed off with all of the clients.

During the process I did make good friends, in terms of via PR whatsapp groups, Expat forums, theres a community, or theres an app called discord for gamers but there was a guy – he has created a discord channel wherein..So discord has all these channels, and one can ask questions about the assessment, so this is not only for people asking for PR related questions. So we have a channel for jobs wherein people can share the jobs. If people have some location specific or state specific questions.

So, he modified based on the requirements of this PR group, or the requirements of the people. Like, say for example, for whatspp, the topics can get diverse anytime, and one cannot keep track of things. Like, one can ask about PR processes, so you ended up having these different whatsapp group. So, this is one channel.

      "Ma:\tI think theres no stage in my case, because everything was done in like 10 months. Skills assessment was done by ACS. Its fresh in my mind. I can put the initial thought as well. Started collected documents for skills assessment from December 2017 and then I applied for ACS in December 17 and then I did my PTE. I got results in Feb 18 from ACS – positive assessment. The document certification, I did everything when I was submitting for ACS. I did PTE twice in Jan 18 within the span of 10 days. First time I gave it, I didn’t get the required score. I wanted a 79+ - I didn’t get it. So, second time I decided let me try again because, at that time it was a tight race. And as we know that the doors are closing. So I had taken a – PTE, has a PTE gold test kit. Its like course, but its like, how the actual exams pan out. So, they have silver, gold, and platinum. So ,silver is one test, gold is 2 tests and platinum is 3 tests. So, 3 practice tests and it does a similar evaluation – how the actual test is evaluated. So it gives you an idea how one applicant stands in terms of their oral communication, written communication, or understanding what the speaker is saying, or be it reading. \n",

So immitracker.com is not but just a free site where people put in when they have put in an application or when they have filed an expression of interest, whether they have got an invite or not, if they have got, when, or if they have lodged the visa. So, it just gives you an idea about the trends. But expat forum was like – THE platform for me – where I could find – all the answers were available on that. So, within expat forum, I happened to meet – I happened to be a part of whatsapp groups. Then from whatsapp groups we got the discord community wherein right now, about 300 people are there. \n",

Because a couple of flatshares were available and I contacted them or they contacted me, and it might have worked out but then we found a place for ourselves within our budget. But yea, Indians in Sydney – a bit. But yea, its become a piece of a joke. I mean everyone on it is cracking jokes. People ask a serious question and people are just making memes of it. So telegram is also an app wherein one can post in different groups. So, theres couple of clients that I know. They were running like 5 different types of preparing groups – one was only about preparing for IELTS or PTE, one was only about preparing for pre-PR process, documentation and helping people with documentation, one was only for post PR wherein after getting the PR what should one do about migration checklist and then there was a jobs group. Since whatspp has a limitation of 256 people, telegram doesn’t have any limitation. One doesn’t even need to know the phone number because it can be based on email ID. One does have to get a link to join a group and then they can join it. Even discord is something like where no one knows your mobile number or email ID. Its your discreet identity, whatever you want it to be, because people think about the security point of view as well. I don’t want to share my mobile number with anyone so Ill tell you – this whatsapp group became a problem after I migrated over here because people were calling on whatsapp. I happened to be an admin of one of the groups that I was a part of initially. People were giving me a call at night at like, 2 o clock, 3 o clock because back in India it was like 9 or 10 in the evening. They used to give me a call, like, Mithun, we are at so and so points, do we have a chance, or people who already got the PR – did you get a job, do we stand a chance, do you have someone you can recommend us. But I couldn’t… so I left that group and said that I am part of this discord community so if anyone wants to have a question, I am free to answer over there. Whatsapp – So I was part of 3 different groups. Each had about 150-200 people. One was only specific to my skillset. It was defined only for business analysts and systems analysts. They had about, like, 150 people. There was a generic group only for people applying for 190 or state sponsorship for NSW. It had about like 200+ people. And there was a generic 189 group where everything was there. On an invite day – or when there is an invite round, there might be around 200-300 messages within an hour. Like 12 o clock Australian time, the invite round starts. So by 1 o clock Australian time, there would be like 300 messages. People might be asking questions like did anyone get an invite. If one said I got an invite, there would be 200 people saying congratulations. Or if one gets a PR, there would be 200 people saying congratulations, you got a PR. \n",

When my employers or ex-employers ditched me that we cannot sponsor you to UK – that was a significant event. So that happened in Aug-Sept 2017.

We had a stable life, everything was going well and my parents were like why! Everything is going fine. Why do you need to go? First question was, are you going for money? I was like money is never the question for me because I am. So I can say that I was earning aplenty in India where I could afford a house, a car, a pleasant lifestyle, don’t have to worry about anything. So, I was like, money is not a factor for me. Im going for our future. When I say “our” – it was about my, my wife, my kid as well as you – you guys – you have struggled all your life and need a peaceful life, or deserve better and I don’t think India would give that justice to you guys. And I want to really make you go around the world and.. then the other thing that I asked them was like if 5 years down the like I don’t want any regret, so would you allow me. So I guess, when we were taking a decision, it was a collective decision. So first one was why – but I wanted my parents as well as my in-laws - my wifes parents to say yes about it. They need to be in a positive mind, they need to support us, they need to say yes. If they said no, we wouldn’t be over here. It was, plain and simple – in my and my wife’s mind that if our parents – all 4 of us agrees, then we’ll go to the next step. \n",

So yeah, from that day till the day we got the visa – my dad and my mom did have a few questions, few apprehensions that we are just running away from our responsibilities towards our families. But that was not the case. That he realised when we got the PR and within one month we were planning to move over here – he realised how much prepared I was for taking that decision. He almost thought that, Im this way, Im just taking my time here. He didn’t realise that me and my wife were pretty much prepared for it. I said to my dad when I got the visa that I am arranging funds for you guys for a year because my dad has an income or its like, hes more of a retired guy. So I was like I am making arrangements for the funds for you guys which you can survive for a year and if need be, I can also arrange for one more year – if I don’t get a job or of either of us don’t get a job in Australia. So, you don’t have to worry about it. You don’t have to stay or do cost-cutting, live life in a shallow budget and all. That made him realise that we have planned and we are it just talking in the air. He realised that my son is going his pathway. \n",

So, as I said February – I just give you a timeline as well. So, March, I got an invite from NSW as well as Victoria. So March 18 is when we got our nomination, the invite wherein we had to submit all the documents. So, NSW approved me and within 5 minutes I got rejection email from Victoria. So basically, either of state only will approve my nomination. So, that’s where the PCC, then we did the medical in April 18 along with all the other documents like income, job or employment proof, tax returns along with the payslips.\n",

      "Ma:\tYea – there were a couple of guys that were struggling and they were not decisive. So theres this guy from Melbourne who used to give, he was on 457 and he was thinking aboit applying for skilled migration visa and just when he was thinking about it, Victoria decided that… there used to be a pathway that 457 could directly convert into a state sponsorship. They were about to close it and he tried, he was scared, he wanted to do it but he got a bit complacent and didn’t do it. And one day is a day when finally it stops and Friday people started floating news that its closed, its closed. He got panicked and he gave me a call. He was like, Mithun I don’t know, I mean I didn’t do it yesterday and now they are saying its closed. I was like, are you able to log into your Victoria site? He was like yes. Would you be able to do your application right away? Yes yes, Ill do it, ill try but already it is closed. I was like, just give it a shot. Leave everything to destiny. And he applied for it. He was the last person I think to apply because they shut it down on Saturday morning and Friday evening is when he applied, and after 2 or 3 weeks, Victoria didn’t get back to him. Generally, for 457, if they are approving it, they get back within a week. So, even close to a month, they didn’t get back to him and after a month a reply he got a reply that his nomination has been approved. He gave me a call. He was so happy, he was like Mithun, you helped me a lot and you are the one because of who I was able to do otherwise I would have given up because he spoke to like 4 or 5 people and they all say – you can’t apply, you can’t apply. I was the 5th person who he gave a call and I was like you give it a shot. And I’ve seen people misguiding people on this process, or scare people, or what I’ve seen is people who have already moved over here – they try to manipulate people who are still in the journey. They see them as a competition and they try to… If you go to Harris Park or somewhere – they say that ‘bhai tera zaroorat nahi hai yahan pe’, you are not required over here. They feel like they are the rightful ones and we are the ones who are not required.\n",

      "Ma:\tWe didn’t have an option, or you can say we did have an option but my friend used to stay in Auburn and he was like, very adamant that you come to my place, stay with us. So, there was a different aspect when we stayed with them. This is the guy that I barely knew. We were just work colleagues and he was like more than welcoming us to stay at his place. They are Islamic but they were like, you come to our place. We were vegetarian so they didn’t cook anything non-vegetarian at their place for like 15 days – the number of days we were staying over there. They had a toddler and even he used to have, like, egg omelette in the morning. They didn’t even cook that for him. After 10 days we came to know that he used to eat that and we had to tell them – ofcourse that, its fine. We don’t have that restriction or anything. We are fine with everything. You do not have to cut your intake just because of us. So yea, They changed our perspective one more time. So since then, what we try to do, anyone from their PR journey, or otherwise wants to come over here, who is planning their initial move, I try to reach out to them and say if you need any assistance, we are there for you. I mean, if you want to stay at my place, you could stay at my place till you find a place or few of them, who wanted to come and they were pretty much unsure what to do. So, me and my wife – well tell them that you can come, and more than happy to host you till you can find a place. These are all people from social media. \n",

And theres this long one, I think like 864 or 143 – contributory and non-contributory parent visa. So at the end of the day whichever option that allows our parents to stay with us for longer time or permanently, that’s the option.

      "Ay:\tI used to stay in the US for 2 years… 4 years. Then on and off I was in the UK. I used to travel. So, I was supposed to go to US but all this visa challenges etc.. So, the alternative I was considering was Canada and Australia. Right, couple of options. Among that the favour in Australia was the weather and also the thing about Australia was the dual options to work in Australia and NZ. NZ is slightly behind from global opportunity standards but still it gives you multiple options. So, and also, if you look from an economy standpoint right, Australia looked like more opportunities available compared to Canada. So, these were more educated guesses from what I could find in research. This made me, and, more than anything, the process also was much more convenient and easier compared to the other parts – Canada or any other countries for that matter. And one more driving factor was when I shortlisted, English was a big factor coz if you try Europe or anything, the language barrier comes in. Australia was a big win and Canada as well when it comes to the local language. I started my career in India. So, pretty much born and brought up in India. Then I went to the US for 4 years, then came back. Then for about 3-4 years we were trying to go back to the visa process, you know with the economy changing, it got rejected again and again. So, then I took a couple of years off to decide what I wanted to do. But then myself and my partner thought it would be maybe good to just explore. Even now we’ve come here – we don’t know what’s gonna happen even 2 years from now. So, we’ve just come here to explore and so far, it’s been good. \n",

      "M:\tHow did you Plan your migration?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ay:\tSo, the reason was not migration. We just wanted to go, and travel new places, just to see different cultures. So, it was US and UK for a while. So, Australia compared – 1 was work visa was an option but compared to that PR was slightly better. At least at the time I decided to apply. It was more like, lets apply and see how it goes. It was not like I want to go king of this. It was more like let’s just give it a shot and see if it works out then we’ll give it a shot. It was more like, baby steps. So, it’s very short. We started our thought process sometime like November 2016, and after a year and half I was here. Nov 2016 was when the idea crept in. One of my friends suggested. So, the thing about Canada – because a couple of my friends stay there – but we thought about Canada. There were a couple of factors – the cold etc. So, when you start talking to your colleagues or close friends, we thought, okay why not Australia. We started to do some research over the net – it was the immiforum, everything. What we found was it was very simple. Whether it’s a right thing or wrong thing, that’s a different thing – but it was very simple. What all they want was very quantifiable. So, it was just – we started addressing one by one, whatever needs to be done. Thankfully, the forums were very (what do you say) very explanative. Immiforum. One of my friends gave me the link. There are people who list A to Z of what needs to be done. So, you don’t need to worry about anything, you just follow. I think Immiforum, I don’t remember. When I started off, one of my friends suggested this forum site. So, you know when you search migration to Australia – one of the first thing that comes up is do you want to go to a migration agent who can help you with things. So, that’s was the call I had to make. Do I want to consult someone? Then I started with this forum. Anybody who knows how to work with computers could do it. It was pretty straight forward. So, I said we don’t need to spend that money. So,  then the thing was trying to get into what are the steps we need to do. So, Nov-Dec – December was pretty much trying to understand, alright what do we need? So, a bunch of English tests. So, we gave IELTs. That’s when I realised, I couldn’t write for nuts. So, you for for 10 years, with IELTS its back to basics. It was like school. So, I gave it a shot. Still, I was just getting 60 points. I was like okay this cannot be good enough. So next thing I did was I gave the ACS. That was a big shocker for me because they figured my 6 years of experience was not valid. So, I had close to 12 years of experience at that point, but they deducted 6. So, my points again went down to 55. [Laughs]. Then I decided to take the PTE. One of my friends suggested that. It’s a computer-based test and it was very interesting. I blogged it. I studied for a week or so. During that time there was an emotional turn in my family. My mother in law had a heart attack. I was in the hospital for a week so couldn’t prepare much. Then I called PTE to reschedule and they told me because it was less than 72 hours or something, so can’t reschedule. So, I just went there and took the test just like that and fortunately I got 20 points out of it. It was my first attempt and I did not prepare well for it. I just knew what the pattern was. So, that’s when I realised probably my English was ok. Sometimes it takes a test for you to know what your strengths are. So, 2 IELTS and 1 PTE. So, once I had that, I already had 70 points with me without even my partners points. So, I just went and submitted the EOI in April. That’s when they told me that since I was in the US for 4 years, I had to get the police verification done. That was the biggest thing. So, there again the forum helped me understand what I needed to do. That was the biggest process. So, I submitted the EOI. Had to do all the yards post US. That was the biggest challenge because now I heard you have tracking numbers but in 2017, they didn’t have. So, you had to send it to them, wait for 12 weeks, email them, call them to check if they have received because you have no tracking number, and this was like, you have to hand-write and post it via DHL to them. So, they don’t confirm to you. So, you have to keep on tracking yourself. So, I was more concerned about that police check than anything else. Good story was that within a couple of months I already got the invite. The first round – because I think from April to June was the freeze period, they don’t process the applications. So, one of my friends said you have the state nomination but since then, when I saw the trends, you know the immi trends, it was very quick. You know, the first round, I got the invite. So, I got all the other documentations in place but I was still waiting for the police clearance from the US because they gave us 2 months. Then I realise that when they sent the post to India, it gets lost. So, then I called them to change the address to post to my friend who lives locally in the US. So, when I started reading, people were saying that usually for India, it gets lost. So, they gave me an option to fill a form and submit change of address. So, I gave my friends address who stays in the US because you don’t need a physical copy. You just snap. So, as soon as he got it, he just sent me the snap through Whatsapp. So, using all that I was able to initiate my visa. So, once the visa was applied there was nothing to do, just waiting for it. So, they told it takes 9 months. So, I put it at the backburner and just continued to work, whatever I was doing. And the the CO gets assigned. I was checking every 15 days or so, nothing happened. But just, after the 30th day or 45th day I got the letter directly. I didn’t get any CO or anything. I got the PR grant straight forward. It was very smooth. So, I think I did something right. [Laughs]. So, the thing I was saying is that on the forums its pretty elaborate. So, since you work in the IT field you know how to name the documents and stuff. So, I made sure I have my own check list, you know, what I need, and do the forms etc. in parallel. So, it’s very quick from the time of initiation in April to receiving it. October 31st my letter was in hand. In India I had a 3 months’ notice period. So, you can’t move before 3 months. The good news was that I had 1 years’ time. So, it came in Oct, and I had until next year September (to move). So the 2 schools of thought were either continue working, bring your wife here, put a port up and go back. Then we decided it would be too much hassle. I was okay, what the hell, I’ll come here first, try for couple of months to get a job. So, decided okay, lets one of us go, while she can continue working there. So, see how it goes and then. \n",

      "Ay:\tSo, first part was here I knew no one. Absolutely no one. So, at that point I didn’t even have people to tell me there were FB groups – the Indian groups in Sydney. When I researched on Sydney, random groups were coming. I did not even know they were people – Gumtree was something. Thankfully, I had a very close friend of mine from my previous company who had a very close friend here. So, probably a month before I decided to come, he just connected us. He said yeah just come and you can stay at my place. So, accommodation was settled but overall it was a challenge because, you also know, there’s still a little bit of bias. So, people, the agents who was supposed to give.. like.. you don’t get any opportunity. So, I was getting interviews on and off but still I came here March. So, Easter was April and pretty much April was pretty slow. So, not getting much done. Coincidentally there was a guy who worked for me in India. So, he used to work for HCL. So, he just told me, you just share with me your profile. So, I sent it to him. He sent it to someone, and the 3rd day someone called me and said that there’s an interview, would you like to attend. I said ok and that’s how I got this job. So, from what it looks like from here is not that bad. But at that time 3 months was pretty frustrating. Nothing much to do. To be precise, exactly, I got my offer in 2 months. Then the background verification took about 2 weeks. So, less than 3 months I was in a job. \n",

      "Ay:\t[Laughs]. Wife was pretty supportive – so, no worries at all. Son, was 2.5 years old so, couldn’t say anything. So, what are the driving factors – one, environment – from India you know, there is so much pollution. So, my son was falling pretty sick there. We are from the South – Chennai. We were not really sure why my son was falling very sick but from all my friends who were abroad, they would say, the probability is slightly lesser. So, we were like let’s give it a shot and see how he adapts. So, we felt it could work out better because he had this case. Its call febrile fits, its seizures, febrile seizures and theres no reason for it. So, he had these, little bit if health issues. So, we thought let’s go abroad and see how it will work. So, I came here and my wife was still back. So, the initial idea was I’ll come, get a job, work for 3 months, get some income and then I’ll bring my wife and son along. But, it so happened in the 3 months, my son was missing me so much. There was so much pressure on me for them to come here soon. So, the day I got the job, the 15th day I found a place – whichever place they gave me coz then I learnt a little bit about the rental history as well. Its not just the job. They don’t give you for first, like first time rental is not easy. Apparently, I was blessed, there was this one guy, this one agent who trusted me. He said, it you want it you can take it. I just want 12-month lease. But that was a hell. There was one day I saw 15 houses on a Saturday. I didn’t have a car and I walked 13 km that day starting from… so I had a calendar with me where I was listing from Rhodes till Westmead. I saw Rhodes, Denniston, Parramatta, Westmead – so I saw close to 15 houses in that day. So, the houses which were good had 50 people looking. So, I stand no chance. Houses which had no one, I didn’t like those places. So, after that finally one house was okay, not an issue. The agent said okay. So, that worked out. So, the day the rental was sorted, the same day I booked my flight back home. So, the first salary, I just booked a flight. I went over there for 3 days because I didn’t get a holiday. So, I went home, brought them. Prior to that, first month salary, I just went to IKEA, bought few stuff, went for the electronics, and a friend in Melbourne put it on some card she had that gives you 5 years interest free of something. and one more friend lent me some money and said just keep it. Give it to me after 2 months. And, so with all said and done, in a matter of one month from the time I joined, I had my family here. That’s what happened. \n",

On the other side its just that one year of experience .. I kind of understand how the system works, like, where should I park my car, how do I drive, or like..like..tiny little things.. like where to go for my grocery… Its like  very tiny little thing that give me a bit of introduction on the first time so next second time its get easy.

So its not really that difficlut and even after I got the scholarship, and then I have like a half year, before I actually move here. So, for that half year I have plenty of time to slowly gather all documents and mentally really prepare to, you know, I am leaving HK.

I don’t know, like literally they would not know what documents you should prepare and other stuff, like, they don’t know it. But then they mentallty they are very supportive on my decision to move, which is great, so I wouldn’t have that burden of thinking oh what about my family if I am moving.. that kind of thing.. so its very good. Yeah, they kind of like, they already know my boyfriend and so they feel more comfortable knowing that I will have someome here that will support me when I first move here. It wouldn’t be as easy if I don’t know anyone here, then I just suddenly want to do a phd here. That would be more difficult I guess. \n",

But they are in Adelaide and at the time I actually got a position here in Sydney, which is like, they are quite far away from where I am. So, they are not really of much help to be honest. But yeah, I didn’t really consider that much because I have a lot of friends in HK but then I was thinking about that it is easy nowadays to keep in contact like with whatspp and all those FB groups and all those stuff. I don’t think, that even now, after moving here for 3 years, I don’t think im quite separated from them, like, although I will miss some of their gatherings but yeah, its still fine, like I can still talk to them and stuff like that so..I didn’t think that was a factor that I was considering. \n",

      "\n",
      "J:\tYes, so I got to meet some more friends, mostly through my phd program that I can get to know other people within the institute.

Like, a month, because I applied for it and then within a month I got an interview and then my supervisor basically tell me yeah I would like you to join us, like, an hour after the interview. It was like, realy quick. So yeah, it was pretty, pretty good. Umm.. but then after that it was like half a year of gap because I have to finish off my master first. Umm but then after I finish my master, it was like 2 weeks of waiting on a student visa to get here, which is not that long. Like 2 weeks is not that long. Everything is like online, like through the internet and I don’t really need to talk to anyone physically. \n",

      "\n",
      "J:\tUmm, I think I am in science, a very specific field of science, which is important to the society in general because it is about the plants, its about the future of agriculture or forestry or environment so I feel that is very important thing. But at the same time the reason why I get the Phd here is that because they haven’t find a suitable candidate locally. Otherwise they could have find someone here locally. So I think I am just filling up a niche here that is not filled up. That is why I feel like I have the skills to come here that someone else here in Australia doesn’t have. So that’s why I think Im skilled. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "J:\tI have actually looked into the skill list. I think its called the skilled migrants list or something like that. I think agricultural scientist is definitely up there because they need that I think. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay, now we will get into the mapping part: Lets just start with visa categories, so from the point of initial arrival to your current status, are you on the same visa?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "J:\tI am on different visa now. Okay – let me see how I ... okay I can say ‘Julia moving to Australia’, and then I would divide it by stage. So stage 1, so, this was in Adelaide. So this is just a temporary one year thing but then during the time what information I have gathered for going to exchange is, first of all, I go to university- my home university \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "J:\tYes, and then I just basically think Australia is a god destination so I think the home university.. they provide a list of different universities in different countries. So I kind of think that Australia is a good place to go. And I think the second factor, like, I mean that is pre-departural of this trip but then..umm.. actually I didn’t consider much.. I didn’t even think that was a permanent thing back then. But then I met my boyfriend, so.. this how it basically give me an idea of moving to long term. So then, I think stage 2 would be when I actually moved here as a PhD student in WSU. So that one was only 1 year and this one is for 3, no 4 years. The consideration is pretty clear. The consideration will be that my bf is here and then also it’s a very good place for career for a scientist and also I considered that it is a very good diversity place – cultural diversity, I think that they have a better acceptance, I think in terms of you know, migrants. In HK its not as many migrants as here.. umm.. also because my bf is not HK people and its easier if I am here with my boyfriend. Like if my bf come to HK then its more of a cultural shock for him. So I think, these are the major considerations I was having. I actually just look for the positions that were available.  I just look for whatever is available and I didn’t really contact anyone here beforehand. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "J:\tJust look for this kind of .. oh, okay.. umm.. I don’t know.. with research community, I think generally we know that, you know, its everywhere in the world.. umm.. I didn’t really specifically ask anyone. I just look up those university website. I didn’t know what do you call them.. like recruitment for just PhD scholarship. Like online website for PhD positions worldwide. That’s what I was looking for. And I actually did look for job available, for example, on other job search engine, like seek.com or stuff like that. But then ofcourse, at the end I got a position in Phd so this is the final thing that I got. When I get the position it was 2015, but when I actually move here on 2016.\n",

      "J:\tI think I was a poor student. I didn’t look up all of the options.. and I trust myself as a PhD student or a potential PhD student. I kind of think everything is already online. I can just follow whatever the direction over there. And the good think about moving from HK from over there because HK was a British colony so all the documents is already in English or in Chinese, so I don’t really need a translation. I think... umm... yes, about that, I actually got an education agent in HK, but then the whole reason of it is just because so many of the documents they need here, they need certified but then.. they basically.. what the service they provided me is the certification because in HK we don’t really have a service thing, that I need anything certified. So when I go to .. like.. here in Australia you can find a (what is that) JP or chemist? But then in HK when I go for a chemist or a bank and ask them for that they were like… I don’t know what you are talking about. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "J:\tNo they haven’t. But I think what they do, like, later I found out is that the university will pay them back for providing that service actually. For accommodation, my boyfriend is already here so I just, he helped with a way to do it. Lets say he hasn’t actually physically helped me because he was still living in Adelaide then but then he would told me all the source on where I can find help or how I can find accommodation – stuff like that. But actually how I got accommodation is actually through flatmates.com. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "J: \tBut shorter [laughs]. At least its in the same country. For him its easier because of his profession. Its easy to move inter-city, like, in between the different cities within Australia. But if Im asking him to move to another country, its more difficult for him to find a, I don’t know, they have different kind of certifications for different regulations for different engineers and stuff like that. So its more difficult for him if I am asking him like, hey move to HK. So, moving inter-city for him is more just, you know, he has to resign from his job and then look for a new job here.\n",

      "M: \tin term of your migration status now, are you considering PR?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "J:\tI am on a process of getting PR. I am, well, orginally I was thinking I wanted to get the skilled migrant, but with that one, I have to kind of wait for graduation – for PhD first. So I wanted to skip ahead so that’s why we actually applied for the partner visa instead. So, the 820 – which is the temporary partner visa – I am currently on that. Stage 3: I think I applied for it last year – that’s partner visa. The consideration I have is more about the career, because as a student, as a PhD student, you know we have that awkward period of time where we submit our thesis and then we have to wait certain months without any support until they declare – oh yeah, you can graduate now. So, I don’t want to have no job during that period of time. But then with the student visa we have this restriction that we can only work for 20 hours per week, which is really little. So I want to skip ahead and if I can get a partner visa, at least as a bridging visa, I can still work, like FT, instead of just having that temporary thing. So its more, just career – I want to jump ahead on the process so I can start working.\n",

This one, and then during this time when I was looking for accommodation… so like flatmates.com which give me idea of where I can get accommodation. Skype with boyfriend or whatsapp. During the time, after my exchange and before I got PhD, so one factor, because my bf is here so I want to find a job here. But the other factor why I really want to leave HK is because this event happened – it’s a political movement called umbrella movement. So, what happened is that most of the HK youngsters trying to get a real democracy system to choose their – we call chief executive, but basically, the mayor of HK. We didn’t get a very fair system for doing that. Umm but that is one of the thing that get me really disappointed with HK. So, I guess that can go into it as a political reason. This is getting me very frustrated with the political climate in HK. Like the govt can do anything because at the end the movement, I mean, during this time of the movement they are a lot of youngsters that go for protests and they just sit on the road for ages, I think that go on for months. But then at the end the govt actually didn’t do anything. They just clear the site. It actually poliriased the entire society in HK. So the people, they probably think that it would be better for HK if we stay with China rule but then with the youngsters,l they started getting this idea of getting independence from China, stuff like that. So that is one of the idea that I feel that I am really disappointed with what is happening in HK. So, for – its kind of going into the idea that I already have that I want to move but then it actually strengthened it. It made me feel like I really need to move. I think to me, it’s not like a sudden change for me during this period of time. I think its more just gradually when I move here, and I’ve been living here for 3 years, and during the time when I’m going back to HK, I don’t feel as much of a connection over there as being here because I have my new friend circle and new society, so I don’t know, I feel more connected here nowadays than back in HK. It’s like a slowly growing, sort of, idea of moving.\n",

      "J:\tOne of the major challenge here is to get the police check in HK. That was a bit more difficult because I think for most countries they do it online. Ive heard that other countries you know, they just click click click, like online, and then pay for it, and that’s it. But in HK you have to get a Fingerprint first. I think I can write police check in HK. And then so, the difficult part is that it want me to get the finger printing and then also they only accept paper application. So they don’t have an online system. So, yeah its very confusing because HK is a big city and everything but then, it can be vert backward at times – paper application. The challenge is that the finger printing is not that easy because you don’t do it at home. They want me to go a police station locally and do that. But then normally in Australia they don’t ever do that kind of service for normal people. So, I called up the police station and they only … umm.. one thing. They don’t normally do it, They only allow you to do it locally in the police station that is closest to your suburb. So Im living in Quakers hill so they only want me to go to that one police station. You cant even get to parramatta or any other station. You only have to go to the really local local suburb. So the PS doesn’t normally do it. And then when I call them up, like I called them several times but then they were saying oh, if they have someone that’s retained in their, like, I don’t know, they have someone that’s retained in their room then they cant access the system to do that. So, I don’t know, maybe there are a lot of criminals around. Everytime when I called them up they were like, Oh we have someone in the room – sorry. So that too me, you know, really long time to do that. Like a month – to just to get a fingerprint. And then after that, because they only accept paper applications, they also charge me money. So, to do the payment is also quite difficult because they want cheque, you know paper cheque, which is very ancient. You know we don’t use that. So I think with all these things, The major thing I can say is Technology – they are not up to date on technology. That’s why its making it very difficult. Its very rare, but there are some people migrating from HK, they are experiencing exactly the same thing (forum). The other thing would be difficult because it’s a partner visa – you have to gather all the evidence that you’ve been together. This very, I mean its everywhere, like, you know flight tickets that we are travelling together, we are living together, we have a shared accoungt, but then all those tiny tiny little things and you have to gather them all in one folder or one file. Its quite time consuming I would say. Its not difficult but its just like I just feel like the whole process is a lot of time waste on it. I understand why but its quite frustrating that you are wasting so much time on that. \n",

I just domnt want to think about it at the moment. Oh another I want to put out there. I don’t think I can, I don’t know where to put on the map but I think, its – ofcourse it’s a logical reason that I want to do the partner visa first because it is faster than the skilled migrant. But then at the same time I feel I am going through this process which is general for everyone including non-skilled migrants. So I feel like, yeah I could have done it in a faster way but then at the same time, I feel its not appreciating what I have to offer.

So shs working in the airlines so she gets discounted tickets which is – she onlyu need to pay 10% of original price to come here or go back so I think to me in my mind, its not that difficult for them to visit even if they want and they can have their own life in HK which they enjoy so its fine. I think my mom and dad have little biut of worry for my brother who is going to graduate from uni in Hk. They really want to actually go out and see the world rather than limiting his vision in Hk.

And mostly, I was more inclined to the UK actually. But then he said, you know hes been to Australia actually its better to go to Australia. Again, location wise, it might be different but consider that the quality of life. So, for me, that life quality of life bit convinced me more for Australia.

Didn’t have to pay for any of these services. The only moment when I paid was when I went to a lawyer and it was for a specific question, but it was a very very specific set of questions. It was while applying for the residence, and before submitting the documents and all that because the lawyers from the university were guiding in the process but they don’t make any formal recommendations. So I just had a question, or couple of questions about checking papers, checking everything was right. So, I went with this lawyer – I paid $300. \n",

      "A:\tYes – document translation services – that I used one of the… for the Tourist visa, I did that in Mexico. For the student visa, I already had this from Mexico so didn’t need this. So student visa I needed the IELTS, Translation services. Postgraduate visa – I needed the IELTS again, police check (hmm did I need a police check for student visa? Question mark) – I had to do it in Mexico and in Australia. I had to do actually the IELTS – I did the IELTS 2 times for the student visa because I didn’t get the score. So, yes 3 times in total. Yeah, for the residence I didn’t have to do anything. Yeah, for the student visa I had to do the IELTS. When I transferred to ANU, they told me that they could, they didn’t, I didn’t need to do an IELTS again because you were already studying a year in Australia so that can count as IELTS. For the bridging visa – the bridging visa they just gave when I applied so that’s just automatic. Translation every time – yeah, because there were different things. For the student visa, it was, of course it was education and all the universities in Mexico. For the residence, I had to do the translation of the birth certificates, of the things that I didn’t have to do for the student, and for the Postgraduate I had to do the translation. There was something that I had to do that was different. It was just that one thing maybe. Umm but yeah, for the residence I had to translate a crazy amount of documents, even emails. At one point the guy who was translating was like, aah, you again! The translation for the residence was with someone from NAATI, umm yeah, and that was in Canberra. Skill assessment – oh yea right, skill. For the postgraduate visa, I just had to show that I had finished an Australian qualification, and they give it to you for the same amount of time that you had the student visa. Umm and it’s just for postgraduate studies so it’s just Master and PhD. \n",

And for the student visa, I was paying it myself, and my dad because I didn’t want the scholarship to go back to Mexico. And if I got the scholarship, I would have got that from a city that is very high leves of violence at the moment. So I didn’t wanna go particularly to that city. So I talked with my parents and they were like it might just be better to… we’ll just pay it and you can pay it back to me later. So, anyway, for the student visa we used financial services and it was, how do you say that, It was not a bank but it was when you make the transfer from Mexico to Australia and the moment when the dollar is the best rate, that’s when they send the money. Depending on the amount of money you transfer, the fee is a percentage. I don’t know… like 5-10%. That was for paying the fees. So, showing that you had sufficient funds, yeah, I needed that for tourist and student but for paying the fees for Master I had to use that. We didn’t want to use banks because they – its just too expensive and the cheapest option, that I learnt from a friend, was to use this. This transfer service. Oh the health and all that. I don’t think I had to do it for the Tourist visa. Let me see how much I can remember. The IELTS is $300-$350. Yeah, Ill have to check. \n",

So for skills assessment, like, it was not Science or anything – it was experience in Project Management, he had to write, yes I worked with her, this is was we were doing, bla bla bla.. and that was yeah, I think the skills assessment was particularly challenging to prove and translate all that and to get the people from you know, years ago, when you worked in something, you know years ago to help you with all these requirements. Yeah, that was.. And yeah, the IELTS that I didn’t have the first time. I think with the IELTS it is so frustrating so be sitting there for 4 hours and after fist hour I was like, ahh, and then not meeting all the points for the student visa, its like, ahh, ill have to do it again. But yeah, the IELTS was more a mental thing. The skills assessment was time consuming, hassle. \n",

Not to be.. to feel like I was gonna be here for 6 months and not do anything. If you don’t pass the IELTS, you have to do it. But I wanted to do the IELTS.

Like, the friends before arriving, was mainly like my ex’s group of friends. So, it was mostly like his friends and his group. He met some people through like meetups, and they became good friends, and like, we also became good friends. Oh, Meetups is technology. I think for these 2 visas I was relying on this (the latin Australian group) because they were helpful, and it was free. And I just really found it extremely useful. Like it was very easy to, like, very holistic sort of thing. I didn’t have to do much. After that, for the post-graduate and the residence, that’s when I started relying on the social – heavily because when I was in Canberra, I was .. the group of friends that I had were also going through the residence process as well and there was lot of knowledge that was not a part of online research or something like. When I was telling you about the wife of this friend who was working in the dept of immigration, who was saying like, okay this is the moment for you to apply, double check this, not from a professional perspective but from a, like, friend-ish perspective. It was like ‘I know something. I won’t tell you what it is but I recommend you to do this at this moment.’ Also, I was babysitting at the time and the people that I met during … the clients and all that, were a part of the Mexican community, well, Latin community and they were extremely supportive for everything.

It was just internal, like, I was just extremely stressed about certain things, as in, what if there was something not in my knowledge, super stressed like, do I need to do more things, do I need to do more checks, and I was just, particularly stressed about that for the postgraduate and the residence.

      "A:\tI want to say yes. They have affected my migration. My general – one of the points that I have is that Australia relies a lot on immigration of course but the economical dependence they have on Education facilitates for immigrants to come and do studies. Im gonna leave the quality of education and accepting everyone aside – but it makes very quick things, at least in my opinion, for students. I also think that they are double checking certain visa’s like the 475 when it comes to you know, cases of, they need to make sure that there are no human rights violated. So, I think of course that’s a good thing. In 2017 or 2018 when they were going to change the requirements for residence and for the citizenship. That was, of course it came out of the blue and I was going through the process of the residence and I think I submitted the application like a week before that or something like that. So, the good thing was that I was sort of relaxed that I put that EOI before that happened, and then I was doing the residence I was affected by all these changes that they were doing. I was wondering how this is going to affect me. That’s one of the reasons why I went to the lawyer – how is this going to be affecting me... just double checking that it is going to be fine. It didn’t affect me because they didn’t do any changes at the end. So, I was doing the process when they announced and I was like, ah, this is going to affect me. But because I had the EOI before, it didn’t affect me and then at the end they didn’t change anything. For the citizenship, if, well, I guess all those changes affect in how the pressure you feel to do things now. So for the citizenship, my pressure was, like I need to do this NOW before they change the requirements to be 4 years as a resident. Other than that, no, I wasn’t affected. \n",

I feel like I was constantly pursuing something and that instability, it was, like I was stressed about I don’t know whats going to happen, and then at one point, it was okay I’ve been enough in Australia and if I don’t get the residence, I don’t think that I can go back home and get used to that lifestyle again. So, yes, it was very challenging all the time because even when you’re a student your thinking about, I knew that I wanted to apply for the residence, so it was like a long time of carrying the stress.\n",

      "A:\tWell, so well, friends wife. But also for using the NAATI – the translation services, specific people were recommended by the social groups. Like, this guy might be able to do it faster or this girl is particularly good for translating this. Its kind of ironic because they are all certified and they should all be able to do it but anyways… A friend was saying apply for your driving license and things that prove that you are a part of community and that you’re making your life in Australia, that you’re integrating yourself. So, those kind of things were part of the recommendations. Also, well the lawyers, he was recommended by somebody. There were several lawyers, of course, but in the case of this Latin group, lot of those people went to this guy. There were some people who went with other people but apparently they didn’t have a good experience and that’s the knowledge that they also shared – so like, go to this lawyer because he’s good at this. Also, one of the lawyers from the university, umm there were 2 lawyers. One of them was helping my ex with some of his documents as well but the girl who was a friend of a friend, a close friend of mine. So there was also that, like she would go the extra mile, like you know as in, everything was part of a professional but it was also like, okay I wont tell you this but as a friend of a friend I will tell you, you know.. do this, this is better or don’t do that..I think that it was all generally good advice. Especially going with the lawyer that I went because if I had gone with a different one – I was in a very vulnerable point. I think that any advice the lawyer would have given me at the time, I would have taken. And that lawyer would have said okay do this and Ill charge you for this this this – I would have said yes okay. And going with this person was like okay, I said that you’re recommended by all these people. So yeah, It was like, there was no need for adding pressure of ‘you need to pay for extra things’. So yeah. He just happens to be married with a woman who is in that community group. So, then again, he has a lot of experience with Mexicans and all that but also there were other people who had bad experiences with other people. \n",

I can be with the student visa and then post-graduate visa of his. Yeah, that was the other possibility. I didn’t want that possibility but of course I considered it. In the case that I didn’t get the residence, I thought okay, that might be an option. I didn’t want to depend on someone. Things can go wrong or they can go well but I didn’t want, like I wanted to be with someone because I wanted to be with someone. Not because of migration status. There’s a layer of that.

He could have continued to look for jobs in Singapore or move here with his job and I can ask my company to move me here. Umm. Why we decided Australia over Singapore? Couple of things – I think the first and the foremost was about visa. So, Singapore’s visa and PR laws are very very difficult. Almost all Indians are not getting their PR in this point of time, and the work visa is only for 2 years. So, renewing your work visa is difficult and company sponsoring work visa is difficult as well. Australia from that point – our work visa is for 4 years so it was more comfortable and in that process we can apply for PR and Australia as a country is more open to sponsoring PR for Indians. \n",

Had they – if they had to apply for my visa I don’t think they would have done that for Australia although they had applied for my visa in Singapore.

I have a cousin here so we did reach out to him a couple of times to ask what he thinks about Australia, living in Australia, challenges, things like that.

My mom on the other hand wasn’t very happy about it because she wanted us to be close to India and Singapore is very close to India. So, although career wise she was very happy for my husband but not for the fact that we will go away proximity wise. My husbands family was completely supportive of whatever decision we took.

I had started interviewing in companies in Singapore – other recruitment firms to see what the job market is like because a lot of my friends and colleagues from x company had moved to Singapore. I had travelled to Singapore a lot of times with my job so it was an attractive place to work from and I wanted to move there. So anyways, those interviews were going on. I did get some offers and then when I started dating my husband now, I did also start a conversation with my company to say I want to move there. And that’s what happened. They were able to move me in the beginning of 2017. I start5ed the discussion in 2016, and he was able to move there as well with be because we were kind getting serious in the relationship and he had his own company at the time, which he could easily operate from in Singapore. For me, it was my company and because we were married, he couldn’t be a dependant, and Singapore doesn’t move on de-facto. So, he was sponsored by his own company. \n",

I not only handle one country. I handle 6 different countries in my role. So, I think thats a good skill that I have, which I haven’t seen a lot in Sydney or Australia. Everyone in the same field has usually or more often only just handle Australia in HR, and that’s also most probably because Singapore is considered a headquarter for such roles where they are handling a broader region of more than one country. I think, that’s where I have that skill. So, my skill is still listed in the long, is it long? – as a long-term skill but there is a problem there. What Australia considers skills for HR manager, I don’t fulfil that because of them the team size should be bigger than the team that I currently handle. So, as per Australia’s definition or skills definition, I actually fit into the HR adviser role which is a much more junior role than I’m at so I don’t fit in to an HR manager role. \n",

So they came back with a lot of questions. My partners visa came much before my visa. We had actually moved to Singapore even before I had the visa. So I had already signed a contract with the company and I was off India payroll and on Singapore payroll already when we moved but I was travelling significantly for work in that first month. So, I was hardly in Singapore. So, technically and legally I started my contract with the Singapore entity when my visa came, which I think was the 11th of Feb and my visa process I think started in December. Before that – it was like a business visitor visa. So, I wasn’t getting paid anything. I only got paid once I had my visa. So when we had to sign the lease as well for the apartment, because we moved in, I couldn’t sign the lease as well because I didn’t have the E-pass that was needed. That was fine because my company had sponsored a month’s accommodation. So now, here [Australia]. So, processing time, the visa, when they applied for it, it actually came back in 5 days. We went for our honeymoon, we put in our documents, we were back in and we had the visa. I think that’s also because they [the company] are like a platinum sponsor or something like that. So, processing time just for visa was 7 days. And then a month to move after the visa came. \n",

      "N:\tMaybe I’ll start with Australia. So, everything was sponsored by his company. So, we spoke with a lawyer, a migration lawyer/visa agent in Australia. So, we were on the call. We spoke with the tax consultant. The migration agent was a corporate one but not with his company. A corporation that they had tied up with. So, going forward if this company applies for a PR, they will use the same agency. Then we had a tax consultant just to ask about how taxes work, and any questions about that – so that was another agency, tax agency. And then there was – how do you call it – this person was part of the company who, what is that word called in companies where they help people migrate – Global mobility representative who was asking about what’s important for us, whats not and when he [husband] mentioned whether its easy for my wife to get a job, and answering such questions. And then there was this shipping company. Again, this was by them – another agency who was, who helped us understand if we need to ship anything, how much it will cost, and if it will be reimbursed by the company or we will need to pay for it. So, for this they had tie ups across the world so somebody came to see us in our Singapore house that we just need to see if you need to move anything. We also had some stuff back home in India that we wanted to move so again, same company’s counterpart in India also visited us. I don’t know the names of these companies. Obviously theres police check and all. So for shipping, in the end we took the option of shipping everything ourselves. We didn’t use this company because we didn’t have enough stuff to ship. We didn’t have, we were not moving furniture, and then were reimbursed by the company. Police check and all we did but again, we didn’t pay for it. We didn’t have to pay – I mean in Singapore you don’t have to pay for police check. Both Indian and Singaporean – both you don’t pay for. Its just a record that they give you when you go to them. We didn’t have pay anything. It was pretty straight-forward in Singapore for both of us. We just had to go and get our police check done and it was done in maybe an hour or something. In India, it was a bit more complicated. So, we did our police check and then we did the health check in India again. This was in India, and we paid for it but we got reimbursed by the company. We didn’t have do anything else – our documents were all in English. My husband didn’t have to give an English exam but he just had to show certificates to show that his education was all in English. So, we just got that certificate.\n",

Private insurance is a requirement of our visa and we get that from my company. Okay so that’s agent when we came here. So She reached out to us as soon as we came here and asked us basic things of how many bedrooms we need, what is our budget, what area we like, what kind of people are we. She shortlisted some places for us and then we had a day booked for us to go look around. She did the – everything she did. We didn’t have to pay basically.

So, nothing. Our dollar value spent was only for moving from Singapore back to India, and shopping. Visa process has been easy – I think that was really easy, I mean the visa. For me, getting the Singapore visa was tougher coz I had to do everything. Here, because the company was so organised, moving – the visa process and physical movement was easy. But when we came here, things were not easy because we were used to living in Singapore and things in Singapore are much much easier. Like apartment hunting as well. Here its – I mean over there, it’s a very buyer’s market. So, we could go and see the same apartment 5 times and they’d take our phone every time we’d make a call. Here you have to make the call the same day or else you lose it. Second thing, fully furnished apartment is a very common thing over there. Here, its not. So just, once we had the apartment just buying furniture and buying everything was a headache. Singapore is great in public transport. Here it is not that great. End-to-end connectivity is not there. We needed a car in the first few months so that was a big challenge itself. Bank account opening wasn’t also as easy as it was In Singapore. In Singapore, you go into a bank and I think in 5 minutes you have everything ready. Your credit card, your bank card, everything. Here, the bank account opening took a few hours and then for the credit card as well, we couldn’t get a credit card because we did not have any credit history and then even when we got one, we couldn’t get one which we could use to get points for our expenses that we did. So that was a bit challenging as well. \n",

Then also about, I guess, compensation and benefits analysis through different. This was mostly through recruitment reports in terms of how much will it cost or how much the same role will get paid in Australia. Cost of living adjustments and that was also through payscale as well as online through google. Taxation because there was a lot of – the biggest thing for us was that there was a lot of difference within the taxation in Australia and in Singapore in corporate tax. So, just understanding how that might affect us in terms of compensation as well. [income] Not better off here although the income is slightly more than Singapore, but the taxation is much more – practically double. So, at the end our take home is much lower here than it was in Singapore. But, having said that again, there are pros and cons to be balanced here as well, in terms of how bit the role is and what we’re doing here and stuff. But yeah, the taxation is very very high. There’s some things that are more expensive in Singapore. There’s some things that are more expensive here.\n",

We were not ready for it. We even went to a point and said, okay say no to the company. I think it was just, the more we talked, the more we asked people, the pros and cons, we realised that we’ll take it. Just for future stability, we’ll take the decision from the point of view of again, visa, if we plan to have a family, Australia is a better place to have a family, point of view of owning a house, owning a car – things that Singapore will never allow us, and in Australia those options are possible. I think the big thing was the weather Singapore’s weather is definitely not the best weather.

I never drove in my life. Im driving now. The country has a lot to offer. Again, if you think of having a family and future, we definitely think we would like to bring our child in the world in this country rather than other places where we’ve been before. Will we always be in Australia? We’re still not sure on that because again I still love Singapore a lot so if, in the future, if we do happen to get a permanent residency for Australia, probably we’ll see if there is an opportunity to move back to Singapore just because I like the country and its closer to home. Maybe ill put my father on the map just because it was important that I spoke with him and he was extremely for Australia. So, that I think gave us the confidence and boost that we’re making the right decision. For both of us, I think we really look up to my father.

I really liked Singapore, There was no problem, I still had my visa, he would have got a job easily – his skillset is in demand. So, yeah, it was, that was the number 1 challenge. The second challenge, Im just gonna mention in terms of moving. Second was, I did know not know even till the visa process had started, if my company will move me here. [going back] I also researched about employment opportunities here. So, I had started talking to employment agencies here to see if I will get a job here. So that was the challenge before we moved here. Once we moved, I guess, should I write about things like not having a car/mobility. Also, not having enough funds in the beginning because we didn’t move all our funds to a different country. So, we had to really think about spending or where we were spending, bank, credit card, and just for everything – in terms of how the country operates, from transport to opal card to what you do – there was nobody to tell us that. So, I guess general country whereabouts. So, there was a lot of self research that we were doing about it. So, Although here I would say – his company, they had a portal where expats go and talk about different things on – whether its about opal card or its about your wife finding a job. I think that was a big thing because that portal has a lot going on about expats. So, in their internal portal, people post that – like my wife is looking for a job, bla bla. They also share experiences very very openly where they talk about x has happened, what’s going on, just very open. They do have meet-ups where people who don’t speak English, they meet up, and wives will meet up, so a lot of that is there. But that’s about it. There’s groups on Facebook and Social media where, I haave seen specifically, like Indians in Sydney, people looking for jobs and stuff. So, I’ve seen those groups as well. I am a part of this group om Facebook but I have don’t have any input on that group but I find out about anything that’s happening in Sydney – any event or anything. \n",

So, I became a part of volunteering organisations. So, the first thing I did was… this was last year… I went and registered myself with NSW volunteering group where there was a training, they just talked about what volunteering is. I had to go and get a working with children check done so I got that done, and there was a police check done as well, so got both done, and with that I currently volunteer with 2 groups – one is St Vincent for youth. So basically, they have events planned every month or every 2 months for youth. They only cater to children, who are from a disturbed family. So, refugees or anyone who has domestic violence in the family, or their parents are disturbed. So, they just take this kids to a move, or a park or something and we just have to be with the kids for the day as volunteers. I do that sometimes. And then Im also part of NSW volunteering but the Lane Cove or the city council which is community service. So, there is somebody in an aged care facility that I go visit twice a month. So, I enjoy meeting this aged care person a lot more than the youth part, because it’s a one-on-one meeting. He has a lot of, hes going through demetia, so he doesn’t remember anything after he meets me. But its still good – I enjoy it. \n",

So we’re working on his skills assessment, and hes collecting documents for that currently and then he has to give an English exam as well. I think for the longest time we were waiting for his company to apply because after 2 years, his company could apply for our PR but that comes with a bond of some time that he still has to work there and we have to share the cost. So, there’s a percentage that we have to also pay. Whereas, if he applied on his own then theres no bond and we don’t know if the laws are going to change so we don’t want to be waiting for that. So, he started the process. Obviously if we have the company to apply, the process would have been easier but hes still working on it. I think he should be able to apply for his skills assessment in the next 2 weeks and then study for his English exam. This has been very challenging because he had to get documents from India which is not easy for all the employers, the letters that they are asking for. He has worked for a company that has been taken over twice. So its very difficult for him to get documentation from that first company that no longer exists. So, that’s one of the challenges. He had his own company as well which got dissolved so getting documentation for that is very difficult. So, his paperwork collection for skills assessment is very difficult.

And, because were currently not going through any migration lawyer or an agent to do this, this company will go through the lawyer who’s fees also we will have to split on top of the PR cost. I honestly think we will end up spending the same amount if we do it ourselves of if we do it through them. Of course, the difference will be that the processing time will be much lower considering it took 7 days to get the visa. Im sure the PR will be much faster and the documentation would be less. That’s it.M:\tWhen did you first migrate to Australia?\n",

So yeah, I was in a moment in my life at that point where I had like a really stable job, but I knew that I couldn't, like, move forward. So, I kind of felt that I hit that barrier. I couldn't develop myself more. And I ended up around a relationship. And so it was like that time of like I was really looking into, like going into something new.\n",

Back in Chile, I worked as a clinical psychologist so I was registered with children and teenagers, especially, and I, my my main job was at a school, but not in clinical psychology, but more of like, like personal growth and development activities with teenagers and as well, like year 10, 11 and 12. So yeah, like community projects and personal development projects. So, those were like my main two jobs and what I'm doing here I can't, I'm not practicing as a psychologist so my my degrees not I have to validate it if I want to work as a psychologist and to work as a clinical psychologist is even more difficult than just certifying that I'm like a regular psychologist. Yeah. So it's a long process and so yeah, I'm not doing that I'm just studying and doing work related to uni right now like academic teaching and working in completely different areas. \n",

And I wasn't sure like, if I wanted to invest money and time, in that I want like wanted to be really sure what I wanted. So, I came into positive psychology through like some online courses and some workshops in Chile. And I found like when I did that I, I found that like that was the thing that I wanted to do. And then when I started searching programs, there were few places that had a master's degree on positive psychology and Australia was one of them. And when I looked into the program and the CD, particularly in Melbourne, it made sense because… so positive psychology is related to well-being and like good quality of life and Melbourne at that time, had like I don't know, like five years in a row being like the most lovable city in the world and the program… I liked the way it was structured. So, it was it had like more face to face interaction. And that was I was, I was looking for that.\n",

Then I started doing some research online looking into programs and see what was available and then finding out like, when to apply, the requirements, which included the English tests and all that. So that was Yeah, maybe one year. Little bit more between like the intention of starting doing moving along that path up to that first time that I came to Melbourne.\n",

So there were a couple of diplomas in Chile and Latin America. But then I wanted a master's degree. So, there were like, at the moment four maybe universities offering that and then like looking into that, like, the websites and then looking into the Cities as well. Like, where I, I could visualize myself living, and yeah, and then yeah, so it was by myself, that first stage. Yeah, and then the second stage when I had like everything more clear. I, I got advice from from an education agency. \n",

So, and yeah, so that I think helped it made…It made everything more more easier like to because I had a place where to arrive.

So at that time, I thought that I, I could bring what I what I learned from the masters and apply it in that school. And then later on, I realized that it was not the environment. So I had like a permanent contract, and it was a really stable and good job. So, the first time I didn't consider anything else because I was supposed to just go back. And then things changed.\n",

      "\n",
      "Do:\tThe first one, Um, it was it was quick. So, the first time that I came here, it was on a tourist visa. So, to complete an English course, before the Masters, because the proficiency tests, I had like a couple of issues with the score. So, the easiest thing was to come here and take that program. So because of the length of the course I couldn't apply for a student visa. I had to apply for a tourist visa and as well because I came here first to take that course and then went back to Chile, finished my my job for that year, resigned and then came back to study. So this initial visa was probably one week. It was fast. Yeah so I had to take the course at that time of the year which was between July and October. Otherwise because the next program the next course was was almost overlapping with the beginning of the masters and I needed to have like all the paperwork done before the master started because they needed to know whether I was enrolling or not. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tOkay. And just in terms of.. this this question is sort of a key aspect of this research in terms of skilled visa processes. Do you consider yourself to be a skilled migrant? And if so, how?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do:\tSo yeah, I can be a skilled, I could be considered as a skilled migrant. As I told you before. I'm a clinical psychologist over there, but I haven't practiced here. And it's been a while so I'm aware that my registration, I don't know how it matches. So probably, I would need to take some training to in order to get the certification and go along that pathway. And the other pathway is, I think, as a lecturer or something like that related to to uni. So potentially that could be another pathway. But I don't know how easy, like what what are the real chances of getting like any of those.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tRight? Okay. Alright, well, we'll move on to nothing. And then all of these kind of questions will discuss a little bit more detail. And so you've got everything here. This recording will continue. So we just talk while we draw. So, okay, so tell me about all of the visa categories. in your mouth, you went through from the point of your initial arrival to your current status, including the wait times, processing times and any bridging visas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do:\tSo, the first visa was a tourist visa and this was in 2016. Okay, so this was July to the first days of October 2016. Okay, so this was our one-week processing time. And after that, I have the student visa 1 and that was from… I think it was granted in December, January, but I got here in February. So this was February 2017 to March 2018. And then this was maybe the same… one week. They were really quick, at least at the beginning. Then from this visa, I had a bridging visa, and this was in March. I don't remember how quick this was. I remember it was very nerve wracking because I didn't know… since like, the first visa, the first student visa was over. And then I went into this bridging visa to get another tourist visa. But because I went through a process from December 2017 until until March, early March to try to get another student visa and in the end I couldn't do it. Because…Because of uni. So yeah, while I was doing the Masters, I decided that I wanted to do a PhD. So I applied while I was doing the masters. And I, I got the response that I was accepted in January. So, my research the PhD is in Education about my research is on yoga and wellbeing. So what I wanted to do I because I knew that I couldn't start the PhD until I got the fundings the scholarship, so that wouldn't happen until the second semester. So, I needed to defer the offer anyway. But I managed to save some money. So, and I wanted to do something in between. And I also… I wanted to stay because that you… Like this whole thing of coming and going, it's like it was no good. So, I… I wanted to do yoga teacher training program. But the thing is that it was tricky because according to the framework of education in Australia it was like going backwards, not forwards can guess it was from a Master's to Diploma, and not at uni, it was just an institute. But anyway, I, I gathered everything that I needed I I went to several migration agents. And the last one, they were like, really supportive. They told me this is really really rare to do. But your letter of intention is really good. Like you have a really clear case and I had the support from my supervisor as well saying that in which ways that would benefit my project. But in the end, there was one document that I needed from the university to present to immigration. And when I went to the office to talk to this person at uni to get that document, she told me that she couldn't give me the document. And and that if I intended to apply for that other course, and I defer the offer for the PhD, I was putting at risk my placement here at the uni, the PhD and I could lose it because I was like, there was like some conditions that they said that I couldn't take any course in between, before starting the PhD. So they basically told me that it was the end. So, I couldn't move along forward with my plan because I was putting at risk, what I really wanted to do and it was harder for me to get another spot for for a PhD, rather than maybe doing the training some other time, during the PhD or afterwards, so I had to change my plans. And this was like, maybe within two or three months that I had to get my head around it. Yeah, and then going into the bridging visa and then going into a tourist visa so I could stay a little bit longer. Mainly because I thought maybe I would be able to stay with a tourist visa if I like maybe stay three months here and then because usually the visas are for like one year and you have to go in and out. So I was trying to figure out how to work on that. Finally, after the bridging visa, they, they they gave me the I go to visa for not three months but two. So that was a tourist visa. And so at that time, I had a partner as well so that as well like motivated me to stay a little bit longer. So, then I stayed here as a tourist, and stayed for a conference, which was on positive education and it was linked with what I was doing. But yeah, so they they granted me a visa for less than three months, which is rare. It's really rare. Yeah. So yeah, and after that, so tourist visa, and that was from from March, I think I went into the bridging visa just for maybe one week. So maybe I think this was around two weeks, waiting. And then I got this one [tourist visa] from March until May 2018. This was two weeks. So, then I went back to Chile after the tourist visa. I had to leave. I couldn't stay anymore. So, I did the Masters with a scholarship and I'm doing the PhD with with a scholarship as well. So, because it's like, crazy expensive, so I didn't have I didn't have the scholarship at that time. So, while I was on the tourist visa, I applied for the scholarship and I got the results in late June while I was back in Chile. So basically waiting to be to hear back about the scholarship. So, when I went back home here between this visa and the visa that I'm now on that was like four months in between. And I left half of my stuff here hoping to come back again [laughs]. Took a leap of faith.  So yeah, and then the student students student visa number number two. So, this was tourist visa number one. And then tourist visa number 2. I got this be granted on August, but I couldn't get here at that time because I had to sort things out for the scholarship first. So I got here on September 2018. And I think that goes until 2023. This was maybe two weeks processing. So this was, like quick, they didn't take too long. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tSo tell me about the commercial services that you used in your migration journey from your first visa to your stage now. And this includes agents lawyers, career consultants, document translation services skill assessment service. Is any language tests or internships or anything that you basically pay for? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do:\tOkay, so I didn't pay for anything. So when I…when I got this visa. So I knew what course I wanted to take. And yeah, so I could apply… I could have applied directly to the university but they were charging a fee or something. So, and you know, like being far away it was a little bit can be daunting because like you don't know how what to do. You cant talk to anyone on the phone, you cant physically go there. So this agency it was an education Agency. They’re Australian. So it's called kangaroo. So they’re Australian but they're based in different locations. And then there's another one as well – I cant remember. So since I applied to uni through them, they helped me with everything else. So, they basically helped me complete the visa form and getting all my paperwork organized. And I had the documents already translated. So yeah, so they they are based in another city and …not in my in my hometown city. So yeah, everything like was on the phone and online. Right. So, this was for this one and then I think…yeah so they helped me with the second one. I remember taking a photo at the office like, yay we made it, “another happy student flying to Australia”. So they get paid from the Australian Government and the university. So yeah. So they helped me with this first stage and then…These one's I did it on my own. But since I had another plan here, which didn't work, so I'm just going to bracket it. So, it was going to be student visa but failed for diploma on yoga so here I got I've lost count. Like really like it was so exhausting. I went to so many different migration offices. So, I went to education agencies and migration consultants and finally, one. I cant remember the name, stellar migration I think. So, they were the ones that supported me. They read the documents, I went into the office, I had everything ready, but then the university killed that dream. So, what I finally did was this for that conference. So this was the English course. So, they they helped me with this but then since we didn't we couldn't do anything else. They supported me to apply for the other visa because this is really rare as well, going to the student visa to a tourist visa… they usually don't grant those kind of visas because they want you to just you studied, finished, move on. If you’re not studying again, like move on. So, I'm So but in the end, I actually went into the office again because this is like another story. They they were like not an education agency but a Migration Agency. And because of statistics and things like that, they didn't want to, like, charge me for the service and like, so they told me Yeah, like you can come in to the office, complete the form, like beforehand, and we can check it here and you, with your computer, submit the application. They didn't want to do it. Because if if I got the visa rejected it what it would go into their statistics and they didn't want to mess up that, But they still wanted to help me. Like, they still wanted to help me. So it was weird. But so I went into the office with my computer, and then I submitted the visa. So it is on my own. And that was the first one that I did on my own. And then in Chile this [PhD] one I did it on my on my own as well. All of these ones for from Chile except this one, this one So this was from Australia. I was happy to do it again. I just didn't want to mess it up. Yeah, yeah. So they just helped me like they read the letter. They made suggestions. Like maybe you can put these or not put this. So they gave me suggestions from from an officer, migration officer point of view. Yeah, so like, those kind of things and what documents to support, like upload and stuff like that. Yeah. So it was really helpful in the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tAnd how did you learn about these services? Like was it through electro example going to that agency Did somebody told you about it?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do:\tYeah, actually this one, I got it from a friend who got it from another friend. So I first started with education agencies, and then I ended up with a migration agent. So yeah, so this was first and then since this didn't work, I went the other way.  Before the tourist visa number one did an IELTS test. But afterwards, no, because since I already did the masters and it was within that timeframe. were like okay, I completed a higher education degree in English. I still had the I don't know but I like the language skills to go into PhD without Language Proficiency Test.  so yeah they I got an offer letter from the university conditional to the language and then this one that we saw now on like the letter that I got, it was unconditional. So it was like you're welcome to start whenever you you want but with this one year so before this… I it was like the preparation stage maybe. So the prep I I took the the TOEFL not the IELTS. I took it twice. Times two. So the first one I didn't prepare myself I just went because the dates were coming where I had to apply for uni and I just did it. So I got the score that I the overall score that I needed to apply. So the overall score was was okay. But the writing was below the required so it was 25 out of 30 and they required at least 27 so it was almost a perfect score. So, what I did then with this results, I applied for the Master of Applied Positive Psychology. So, then I applied I got the unconditional , no the conditional letter saying that I had to take the test again or doing that English bridging program. So, I took the test again and I had an overall score was much higher. So, the overall score is like 120 I had 110 something like that, but again the writing of the writing again 25 out of 30 Oh, and I and I prepared for that. So, it was insane. I didn’t understood why and because the first time the the report wasn't sent directly to uni. The second time I made sure that the report was sent directly to uni. And because I checked that box, I wasn't able to ask for review. So yeah, I was fucked up. That's another like big industry like, yeah, you make money. Like, I don't remember how much but it's probably like, at least $200 each time. And the course, I don't remember, it was quite expensive. I don't know, but maybe between maybe 2000 and $4,000. So the good thing is that within all this process, because the the, the tests were required for the university, but for the scholarship as well, to demonstrate that I had a decent level of of English to get the scholarship. So, when I when I enrolled in the English course I, I still didn't know if whether I was going to get the scholarship or not. So I again I took a leap of faith and said, Okay, I'm doing this anyway. I was very determined, and I paid from my pocket for that course. And I think it was one week before departing, that I found out that I got the scholarship. So then I got the money refunded for the course. And they covered one ticket because they want to cover a ticket to come here and then returning. There's a lot of things that that that they cover. And yeah, so great. That's why I ended up taking that course.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M:\tWas that course helpful?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do:\tSo Yeah, actually, It was helpful, but it was designed for people that really, like need to upskill, and I already had prepared, like my writing skills. And I was feeling really confident with that, but it wasn't reflected in the score. So, when I got here the first time I told myself okay, I'm going to take the most out of this because I'm, I asked for it and it was a big issue at the school where I was working at because I had to ask for a leave of absence for three months. And people didn't like that. So yeah, it was like so hard. So much effort put into that, that I when I arrived here, it was like okay, this course better be good and worth it and I learn something out of it. And then when I when I started, I, I realized that the group that I was in, most of the people needed a lower score. So, they, so they tried to bring you to the, to what the university requires. So, for me it was getting, like 70%. And for the rest of the course of my classmates, it was like 60%. So that the difference between, like my skill set and the skill set of the rest of the group were like, not levelled. And then I got a lot of support from from my teacher. as well. So she tried to adapt some things. And I also try to engage in other stuff so I could really make the most out of the course. But then the problem was that we didn't get enough feedback, because the course was designed like that. And it was really frustrating because I was getting my, my assignments back with nothing on them. And it was like, Yeah, good job. You got 73 Okay, but there's room for improvement or like, again, like I'm, I'm here just for this and it has cost me a lot of effort. So, I want to learn something. I need to know what to Improve and that permeated to my classmates as well. And then I found out about issues that were going on at the institute, like big issues and and then there was like a big, like, we started talking and and, yeah i'm i'm really I get…when I see unfair things going on around me I get like activated, motivated and start doing stuff and I started talking and then, at the end anyone like the..It was clear to me at the end that it was a business. So, they were failing students, just like for example, if they had to pass with a 60, they were fading them with 59 or 58 with no reason, like no proper feedback on how to improve or why they were failing. So, it was very disappointing for me and I remember questioning myself whether I had made the right choice because all over that Institute where the logos from this. University and I got like really paranoid at one point because since I was like, speaking out, and everyone wanted me to speak for them, I thought at one point like, I'm not going to get into this In the course or, or or if this is not working well, maybe the Masters is not good and like, Is it worth it? I got into that whole, like, dilemma. But anyway, then I find out that during that year, the institute had gone back independent. The uni locals were there just for for a while. So that's the story about the course. \n",

      "M:\tTell me about the role of technology in your journey from the initial stage to your current status. So online research, how did you conduct it? Where did you conduct it??

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do:\tSo, so this is preparation just start using colors. So this is the preparation stage. So yeah here was online research mainly, like official websites from uni, mainly, um, and this was from home, my personal computer and I remember there was an open day with this university, and they had online resources like, you could talk to students. I remember Yeah. So they had I don't remember how that was called. But like online chat.  And then I got Yeah, like recommendations of which suburbs to be living, like university life. Yeah. more practical stuff. And then yeah, the official websites for the programs and things like that. Well, okay for the visas obviously you have to use the immiaccount. Social media for what I was telling you about like Facebook mainly, the Chilean group - that's another one of Latin women. The Chilean group organize… they organize a couple of events throughout the year so remember to going to a couple but I'm not really like that engaged in those groups. So, social connections so friends, family, greater community in your migration journey from initial stages to current status. So any people or any, any connections that you want to reflect on your map. So I told you about my friends here so they were actually, well, the friend that I know back from from uni, back from Chile during the preparation process. So yeah, that's my friend that was living in Melbourne. So yeah, this was key because during the preparation process, and then when I got this visa as well, I stayed with them. So, I lived with them together for for three months. Yeah and the other the other day we were talking about this. My friend went back to Chile while I was living here, and I didn't meet his partner until that time. So we were kind of getting to know each other and, and my friend left and he left us both living together and he was like, Okay, get to know each other, be friends fast, and we got along like really, really well. I remember the first day that we were alone, like we we talked for hours like getting to know each other's and yeah, like it was a really good relationship. And then yeah, so I lived with them for three months. And then I went back. So, this is like least gaps, like a lagoon, back to Chile for October, October, November, December, yeah four months. So it was like this like, hopping from here, four months there finished my job and then I realized I wanted to quit and came back - student visa. And here it was really difficult to find a place to move in by myself again and when the student visa expired again my friends appeared along the way and here again lived together for March, April, three months again. Back to Chile - again four months, four and five. So here, and then here Chile, here and here guess what again. This time, October, November, December, January, February – five months. So, they've been like key. And I have other friendships as well. But between like this movements coming back and forth, I've lost connection with some people and it really takes time and effort to reconnect with people that you didn't see over those periods of time and I made friends here but then some of them have gone away. So, it's like, I'm not really seeing anyone from this time from the English course from the map…Yes, I still have friends from the from the masters and they have been as well as a couple of them, like, really supportive along the way. And the people from from the restaurant were at work and that has been another source of support as well. That has saved my life with friends and money. I started as a volunteer but then I started working there and in times of need, It has been key. So I had a partner. So I met my partner while I was studying here. So now it’s ex partner. So I met him here. And then we kept seeing, going through the bridging, through the tourist, and when I went back to Chile, and when I got here, and then it's really messy. And here we broke up - heartbroken. Yeah. So that finished. So, I decided to go into the PhD before knowing him. Like, actually, I was on the whole process of submitting the application when I met him. So, I already like my made by my mind about that. But then he influenced me trying to stay over that period. But it wasn't, he was, wasn't the only reason why I tried to do that. It was just I let go of everything that connected me this Chile at that point - When I resigned my job, I sold my stuff, rented my apartment. So it was like, Okay, I'm releasing everything and I'm just focusing on something here. Yeah. So, but yeah, he totally influenced that process of trying to stay as well, like me trying to make sense of what I wanted to do in between, because I knew that if I… if I was going back, even in like after the first student visa ended, I was going to be in Chile, like transitioning, like no job, and as a psychologist, what what I could have done at the moment was clinical psychology, which is not very ethical to do if you don't know how long you're staying because you're making connections with your clients and you cannot like, abandon them. And I couldn't go like into another job because I knew that I was leaving. So it was kind of messy as well. It was really unstable. Lots of uncertainty. last year 2018. \n",

For every visa I had to demonstrate that I had money basically as well as the financial. Yeah with that with like proving like I have a scholarship - This is how much I'm getting, like an allowance. So to demonstrate that I was able to sustain myself while I was living here.

So, they offered me like different courses like they told me - one agency told me no, that's not the pathway. It's better if you take an English course again, and we happen to offer like this one. Okay, no I'm not doing that then another agency. Yeah, you can do but maybe it's better if you apply first for another masters and then go into the PhD and we happen to work with this university. So, things like that. It was really, really confusing.

Yeah. So I can know beforehand what's the best option but I know that with this visa, I should be able to stay the same period of time that I studied, and that would provide, like enough working experience to go into PR.

Yeah, like a real, like more tangible option option here because other countries are are getting as closed as Australia. yeah, like just for tourist visa right now the process is much more longer than what I did before. This is like from experience my mom coming here so, the visa took maybe three weeks to come through and it was her first visa so it should have been easier and for a friend the same thing, and they are asking, like a lot of things so if we're tourist visas, they're getting like tougher, what to expect for other visas. don't know what's going to happen. So one challenge that I didn't mention and it arised here on my current visa, and it's related to the Health Cover, insurance, So I was sick in. I got sick at the end of the beginning of April, end of March, and I had to go to hospital and the Health Cover like there this little part like you usually don't read it, or you don't think about these things on the whole process. Because I have had so many other health covers but this one, It hasn't been a year from since the Health Cover has been working for. So, so they don't automatically cover everything for health issues, and there were a lot of things that I didn't know at the time when I had to go to hospital because you're you're sick so you can't like start searching on the internet or talking to someone on the phone so I had to pay money when I when I went to the hospital. So, it is covered but since I haven't been in Australia for it's been less than a year… they, they, they use the right of assessing everything to see whether it is like a condition that pre-existence or if it's a real emergency kind of stuff. And yeah, that's it's been a long process. So, I still from April, I still haven't been refunded the whole amount of money that I paid. That's kind of been kind of stressful as well. Like, on top of being sick and getting recovered. Like this whole uncertainty of Am I going to get paid or not making phone calls, emails and everything.

But I was in – you know the school system, you have to study till your 18-19, and my mother convinced me that its better to finish school and then go travelling. But then by the time I finished school, I sort of forgot about it. I completely forgot about it. I was totally in this mindset of oh, I need to do something with my life, like a career or… and so I ended up working first and then I met 2 people, who had, they were much older. And they ended up telling me about their travel experiences and it totally clicked, and I just knew that I had to go to Australia. It’s not just they told me about Australia. Actually one was Canadian and he came to Europe when he was young and the other one had a brother in Australia. But, he was more talking about I should go out and see the world instead of thinking of my career. For me these were significant people. So that was the first time and yeah, people keep asking me why Australia and it was just a 100% clear to me. There was no doubt about it. Yeah, there was just no doubt about it. \n",

And then I felt like a bit of a dissatisfaction. And I went to a coach, a life coach who I had a couple of sessions with, and it came out that I want to do some things, I wanted to do a PhD. I love intellectual work. I love intellectual academic environment, but I was in the management at the time, not the research part of it. And the second was I wanted to go back to Australia and the third was I wanted to do research in India. And then I just applied for a position in Australia as well as in the UK.

I came with some money in my pocket but my plan was to stay 3 months because I couldn’t imagine I could stay longer away from my family. Laughs. So, I came here, and you know the big difference was – so one thing was like there were many more Irish and British people backpacking. So it wasn’t much Italian, French. I don’t even know if they could have this working holiday thing at the time. But yeah, so in terms of professional life, you know, I was just working, “working” as, you know, just a bit of cleaning, or like housekeeping, at the reception. Some houses would give out free food so I would give out free food to the backpackers and that would gain me a free night. So, everything was way cheaper than now.

So the longest processing time was the 485. All these study visas, that was in a couple of weeks. But the 485, I think that was like 3 months or so. No sorry, I forgot one visa. Now I know why September. So I submitted September 2017 and when you submit, you have to apply for another visa, and that was the visa that I had. But did I then have the bridging visa? So I extended – that was feb 2017. I think it was 4 years and then I extended but I didn’t need the entire year because I submitted in September and then Im not sure what happened in Sept. I think I might have applied for 485 but then it puts me like, 1.5 years before I get it and that can’t be correct. I had something else in there. Or, I still was on that 1 year extension.

So at that time I was really sure that the 485 is the best option or not and the second consultation was relatively recent one. It was post 485 because it was about, okay, how do I actually come to PR and that is, I can say is 2018-2019. So I had my IELTS language test on Feb 2018. That’s for the 485. Then I had.. the other IELTS test was in 2011-2012… 2012? I did 2 IELTS. That’s the language. I didn’t do a skills assessment yet. I mean, yeah, So I called them up to find out how to do it, Yes, I will have to. Oh yes, Medical – yes that cost me a lot of money for the 485. Police check, yeah. I mean that was one of the things where I felt a like intimidated. So that’s why I went to a migration agent. So, that’s medical, police checks, passport photos!! Laughs,. Yeah of course, the health insurance. Although personally, I would have the health insurance anyway. So, what else, I had to get an X-ray because I said I was in India so I had to get an X-ray.

      "Cl:\tThat is a good question. I like it. Technology. So well, okay lets start from the information on the website of the ministry of migration, Department of migration. So, I find that is one of the most important sources because, you know, its valid for things. I find a lot of websites are out there but their information is not up to date. For me the landing page was always the department website. Personally, I found it actually quite useful for like, you know, this is the documents you need. I mean, at the end of the day that’s all you want to know, okay so.. I found it relatively easy. What I didn’t find easy was to find out what is my visa I should apply for yeah?. So in terms of once I know which visa I need, then it’s easy to look up what I need to apply for the visa. Okay, so If I don’t know, what is my resource? I would say, like, the newsletters. I actually did read a lot of these newsletters from this site [Acacia]. That’s the only thing that I was happy to get, for my 100 bucks that I paid. Laughs. Skype to migration agent. They are in Sydney but that’s just convenient. But, you know what, I actually found this consultant through Facebook.  So, that means that I posted, umm, On Facebook, I said can anyone recommend me someone. Yes, and that was a good recommendation. \n",

      "\n",
      "Cl:\tYeah, so very important. Okay, umm, so who is there. So when it comes to all this study visa stuff, I would say my peers. For me it was like a very very important resource. So ones who went through the process, like, a year older in the process, they have a lot of insights. I also had – so my landlord was a migration agent but he always tried to make me pay for it and I paid so much rent that I never wanted to go to him, like, officially. But he would, Like you know, when he had a good day I’d say… I guess when he had a good day, he felt like… I guess Im a good tenant and I tried to make his life easy. Sometimes, he could feel, I guess, sometimes it came to him to understand that I’m trying to make his life easy, not complaining bla, bla, bla, and then in return he would give me a little bit advice. But that’s, I think that was, when it came to the extension of the 1 year. Umm. Well, umm, when I think about the first time I did this working holiday, I pretty much did this on my own, when I think about. That was all like, phone calls to the Department in Germany. I would just call these guys up, and be like okay how do I do this. Yeah, and then so, I posted this question for recommending someone and I think why I took on the recommendation of this person – I studied with someone back in Germany who’s sister is basically here and she recommended this agent. And, yeah, I felt like it’s a trusted source. And when it comes to. So, it would really make a difference because when it was the study visa it was mostly the PhD peers. I would also say that the university was really useless. I’m saying this because they need to change their thinking about their position; They want to make money, but like International students is for Australia. It’s not specifically for this university. So, university students are a source of income, but they try to withdraw from any responsibility regarding like, helping with migration process. So, and I think its not clear that its sometimes about very simple information that they can provide. I should probably put this on here. So, these were the sources that were good. But let’s also think about those that were lacking or not good. So, university’s graduate school. They are, don’t get me wrong, they are helpful in the framework they work in, but they cannot go beyond. They miss a little bit of a cross perspective sometimes. It’s a delicate topic which I understand. I am aware of this. I also understand that, yeah, I understand it’s a delicate topic. But the university needs to make a decision at some point. I mean, you are model for your students and you can’t stand up for them? So, what is it that you’re teaching to you students? You want employees? There’s no successful employees if you don’t stand up for your values. In the process, there’s always this question, is there a better way? So, I mean, in a way, I’m quite often lonely in this process because, I think social interaction is very important and I get a lot of information from that so it also makes me dependant on it, in a way, like… that’s why this consultant, the second one, is really good because she thinks beyong with me and I feel like, less dependant on the social network. Yes, I do pay money, but I also feel like. It’s a balanced thing – its like oh okay I never heard about this pathway. Its also because, people are not necessarily hiding. Its just like, umm, It’s a different thing. You pay for a consultation and a person really takes time compared to… yeah, let me relate to my question – is there a better way? I relate that to why I pay for it. Is there a better way for skilled migration? I feel like for me, personally, when it came to the study visa extension, everything was relatively smooth. Also the 485 was relatively easy because I could prove that I had the PhD. But then now when it comes to the skilled migration, I feel like, I need. So I actually have colleagues. So, we are moving on to colleagues who help me with this. It’s a little bit, like I said, like, suddenly, I know I have skills but how do I put these skills into this visa system – into the set if skills set by the visa. I am very practical about it. Im like, Okay so this is what they want to see me so what from all these skills I have, whether that’s like, in a certain training, or in a certain job – How does that translate into what their idea of what skill is. How do I translate that? Its exhausting and I also find it a bit ridiculous, but I have to overcome that, overcome my ego and just be practical and say, yeah whatever. \n",

The skills assessment process because theres certain features that define this skill, or this profession and I know I have the skill. I actually worked in this profession for many years. I also have experience beyond that – the defined way. But, it comes down to what the university will certify in terms of working hours and wage. So, that has a double catch because we all know we work more than we actually put on paper. So, that’s one catch and the other catch is, you know, laughs, Its not that im not willing to work more, its how much you get. Yeah, so it’s a process. Im currently in this process. Let me come back to why this first consultation was shit because at the time I was thinking… I was a bit one dimensional. I was okay, I came to Australia to do this PhD… I do this study thing and you know, that’s fine. I do have the awareness of how this migration stuff works. For me it was about living here and I didn’t have the awareness this entire like, skilled migration, politics and all that, yeah. I was naïve and arrogant at the same time, like, why wouldn’t you give me a visa, and so this person was giving me advice. Good advice would have been to say, looking at my CV you can apply for PR right now with this set of skills because this job is on the list and everything is about this list. Your whole life centres around this list. That would have been a good advice and so what happened. I was doing my PhD doing this study thing not having the awareness that I actually, sort of, lose. Of course, I don’t lose, but on paper I sort of lose the experience that I had working for several years in a relatively good position and at the university in Germany. Maybe I should have said, how can I get PR. I was just asking for migration advice and this person; just gave dumb advice I already knew. \n",

      "Cl:\tSo feels like, yeah when I look at this maps, it feels like, I could have done this PR already and for some reason I’m doing alllllll this stuff. I feel like I’m doing a big turn. So, at the moment, I’m waiting, So I wanna get my… I identified the visa with the help of one of my peers – it’s the skill actually. that I wanna apply for… and I need to get my skills assessed. For that I contacted Vetassess. So various documents ofcourse – My key document, lets just the key ones, not silly ones where you have to show that you did the PhD and all – that’s fine. But, key document would be – okay so I called up Vetassess. For me the question was do they assess the skills or do they assess that I have this title, and they said it’s the skills. I need to show that I have the skills. They said the title doesn’t matter. So the key document would be, demonstrate skills So on the website which says so like, x, y, z skills to show. So Im very practical in my approach so Im like tick tick, yes I have this, no don’t have this. So when I say, I don’t have this, can I maybe show it? Is there something that I am not thinking about that can be shown. So my place, is about ‘University lecturer’ and they have stuff like, you know, sparks class discussion. Of course I’m doing that. Of course, Im holding seminars, I’m attending workshops. So, my key document is – at the university is called ‘statement on service’. On Friday I sent to my employer everything I did at the university and its various jobs. I did for 1 year I did advising for students at all levels, on various questions. Then of course, tutoring. Then of course, there’s a catch to it. The catch is that – so I did PhD research – but they want to see, and I’m not sure how to show that. So, they’re saying a PhD is not a research position that counts for the skill of university lecturers but to say that you’re a university lecturer you need to show that you are doing research. So how can I bring that? So, I need to see how to do that. I think its quite interesting to say that I have a degree which is called Doctor of Philosophy but that’s not a research, like doesn’t demonstrate research skills. So, that’s what I mean by.. you know, needing to understand their understanding of how they see it. I mean at the moment, one thing was, I was paid to help writing for an award application so I will bring this in. I will bring in that yeah I am writing publications from my own research. I’m peer reviewing in journals. So, I tried to get the documentation that I’m doing that. So, what it is is really to, out of, sort of, its like a puzzle. I need to bring in for them, my, sort of, puzzled life as a university lecturer – bring it together and be like -  this is what I’m doing. I’m also going to bring in my, I really have management position from the president’s office for 3 years in Germany so its not, I’m not a 25 year old PhD student or something, nothing against 25 yo. But like, I have a whole set of skills that goes beyond this lecturing position. \n",

Although, I have to say, to be fair I would’ve lost my scholarship as an international student. So I would have to wait for 3 years to not lose my scholarship. I had to remain an international student. I mean I just want to add that I never really considered myself a migrant which might sound a bit silly because I feel like I belong here.

They were like educated but my dad, he didn’t, because of the history reasons in China, because of peace generation, he didn’t went for, you know, formal education. My mom is the same. And yeah, I think in general the whole fanily, my grandparents generation – even though I was little but I can tell the difference of their impact on our generation. Not on my father’s generation but our generation. What kind of my brother and I – we look for formal education, we want to learn more. My husband is a different story. His dads side is, his dad is a construction worker or manager in some period and his mom coming from a different family background. His family is like, so complicated, I didn’t like that. Like, his parents was always fighting, like I didn’t know that before we were dating or after we were dating for so long to meet his parents. Yeah, anyway, it’s a long story. Furthermore, to the grandparents generation, I think his dads side were very rich. Moms side was quite poor. Like, exactly like my family background. So, maybe that’s a historical coincidence.

And I think once they move dto this mountain area, I think my dads family, they bought all the land. So, they will settle down in there.

      "Ju:\tI think, its really hard to say. So, I studied English, the language, as my Bachelor degree and then I did some work as a interpreter and translator and then I found a specific area for migration to have foreigners – we call expatriates to China to work, mainly to work. So then, I worked in that area called relocation and migration services, I think for roughly 5 years, before I came to Australia. And now I am doing PhD studies in Migration studies. We can say its consistent, I am still using my professional knowledge about how expatriates migrate and how they adopt to workplace and manage the work-life balance, things like that. All the ideas are coming from that professional background. I think if you look at it that way, I think, I am still using my professional knowledge to this. But at some point, I think this move beyond that as well because at that time it mainly focused at the law, the legal background, the legal regulations in China but now I am moving to another direction – to research the experience. So, in that sense, it’s not so much related to my professional training or professional experience, I think. So I come here in 2015. I think I still worked for the China company for about a year or so We just doing remote – like – working from home from over here. And then, at that time I was pregnant and then I had a leave, a break, a very short break and then I started uni over here and I did my Masters over here and then just go further. I didn’t go for workplace job or something. At that time, I just thought, if I want to change my lifestyle, I may start it from way of thinking. Probably that was wrong. I should just go find a job or do something else and be happy. Laughs. \n",

He was, still is, the only child in his family and he never really got this idea to live so far away from his family. I was the opposite. I was, I travelled a lot within China and I always wanted to find out whats new and have new experiences. So, I kind of persuade him to try different things. So coming to Australia, like, actually, like, when it came to my mind, I said to him that if you don’t want to go, I will go by myself. So, you know, he said, like we are a couple, so we are supposed to be together. So, he said okay – lets do this. So then, after we had a serious talk, I started to do IELTS and then he did IELTS as well. But its just, everything on paperwork, seems to be so good for me. Not until we come we realised that I couldn’t carry on the same profession because of the different regulations of being a migration agent over here. So, that was quite challenging for me actually. But he, he was, he had a small company back in China and he has all this business background and our friends over here offered him a job right away so bingo – and we stayed. We come as business visa and then he was offered a job, and then we start to talk to migration agent, and then, and looking to what kind of visa we can do. But, that’s where the difficulty started. Apparently, its Marketing something – at that time, they need to do a skills assessment something, and he couldn’t pass that and then we thought about other options. So that company hire me as well but because of my professional background, they couldn’t hire me for the regulations even though I have all the knowledge of marketing, sales… I have the experience but it’s just the industry doesn’t fit. I worked for the consultancy company before so I have all this kind of skills. The migration consultancy – and I have management skills because I literally built a team from only myself to 6 people by the time I left the company only in 3 years. I have marketing skills, I basically marketing our migration service, and relocation service, like a lot. And I know, I have sales experience as well, prior to this migration consultancy, I did sales for pad company and steel company as well. I was quite successful in each job. It’s just when we come here, they say no – you cannot just say you have that, and it doesn’t count. I have a degree in English language and then they were saying you have a degree in English Language, and you did marketing and sales and the you did migration consultancy – that’s all migration and that’s a specific industry which doesn’t fit over here. So, we talked so many different options. Its just – nothing works. So, I said, well, okay maybe this is a time to do my Masters because I always wanted to do a Masters. It sounds like the only right move, and also because I was pregnant and yeah.. and now we start to look for student visa and we realised if my husband needs a full-time job, I need to do a Research degree.

My husband’s family was actually like a push force for us to come because his mom simply like push us to buy a house, have children. I think that’s a last draw on my husbands shoulder to push us to move further , to move far away. For me, I think, I just wanted to maybe change, I just wanted to move away to another city just within China, eventually. And then, yeah, but his mom and dad divorced by that time and that was hard time, like, his mom was super depressed, and she lived with us and she had a really negative effect on me. I think my husband saw that even though I have a really good relationship with my mother in law but she affect me like, mentally, psychologically. And I wasn’t happy. Like, I worked super hard. So my husband barely saw me at home. So I always go early to work and come back like, 9 or 10 at night so yeah, but I don’t know. Maybe that’s a good thing or not. And then, another thing was that she found a partner before we moved. I think she moved to living with him few months before we actually decided we wanted to come because my husband, you know, somebody is looking after her and she seems to be happy. Yeah, so it seems like, her life actually, was big part of my husbands consideration, whether, you know, to move away or not to move away even though at the beginning, like I said earlier, we have 2 years in considering to move but he never actually make up his mind to go but that’s the thing. She moved away and she moved away with her life - find a partner, get a job and they were happy so that means that we can actually have our life. But we didn’t like Shanghai. We thought that we would go to other cities anyway but why not to be brave and go to different country. \n",

Anyway, we didn’t. And other friends I don’t think we have a lot of friends for networking, or Im not a big fan of social media and FB was banned in China. And, yeah, they are, not so many platforms were available to us to get information. We have education agents in China but they always charge you money to give information which I don’t believe as well and yeah, for us we just thought we have to come to Australia to have a look and search the information by ourselves and also because we speak the language we are so confident we are going to survive here by all means.We have couple of business clients – so before we come here, my husband was doing business with them. Maybe like, I think, to a couple of close clients he mentioned he may be coming to Australia. I think they were quite supportive but they didn’t ask then why.\n",

So the friend over here send us the invitation and then we just book the flights; we just showed them our bank account with enough savings to stay in Australia for a year. Yeah, that’s it. It was 1 year visa. It only took us like 4 days. So, I prepare the documents. I think that was maybe spend one day filling the forms and preparing other documentation. That was quite quick. But before we do that, actually I was always thought I may go for further education so I did other process like notarising our degrees, translate that, get them officially transcribed, translate into English and notarise that. We did our ielts test. – that was not required but I prepared that anyway as a just, you know, just, out of my professional experience, you know, that we may need other options and they may request this kind of documentation and if we come to Australia nobody in China has the capacity to help us to do that kind of thing. We even notarise our marriage certificate, our birth certificates. You know everything I can think of as a professional migration consultant, I prepared it. The only thing I didn’t no is the criminal record because that is a timely document. Even if I did that I know that at some point I will do that again. So, that’s the only document that I knew could be handy but I didn’t do. \n",

Even though maybe that doesn’t apply over here but I, it can work for companies who is dealing with Chinese, you know. Im a expert in that kind of background. I just feel like Im skilled. I’m actually really skilled. I have 7 years working experience, 5 years of management skills and I couldn’t transport them over here. Its just a shame. I didn’t actually go out and find a job because of I was pregnant, and I thought you know, if I don’t have a long-term visa maybe it’s kind of challenging for me to find a job.

Again we have a bridging visa because we got a new student visa. So here, I think it took us 4 days. This is 2015. And this still 2015. Bridging visa i don’t remember how long... I don’t remember exactly how long. This was granted over here for 3 years – and then this bridging visa because my daughter was born. That was a mistake because when we applied for this student visa we forgot to mention that I was pregnant or something and then and they were saying, after my daughter was born, that you have to apply for another visa, because they were saying you didn’t mention over here that you are expecting a baby. If you know, at that point, you won’t have to go through this process. And we yeah, so these take couple of months I think. So these were granted July, yeah and for 2.5 years until the end of the study and then this was – this was when. I think in May 2018 and then – that was pretty soon. 4 years, I think 4 years visa. That only take I think 2 weeks in between from that bridge visa to student visa. I think that was the quickest one. Over here, this was submit I think in March and was granted in July because they had to review the information for my daughter, I think I had to submit birth certificate, immunisation – I don’t know why they ask for that. I think they ask for a few documentations. I just feel like you know, that’s my daughter but they wanna ask to prove that’s our daughter. Laughs.  \n",

I thought if we hire somebody and they do all this kind of planning job for us.. you know.. that would be easy. But, that’s the thing of trusting other people and trusting them professionally.

      "Ju:\tOh – that’s a lot of money. I don’t remember how much but okay – just have a general idea right. We did IELTS twice for me. My husband did twice as well. We did medical check I think, twice. So students visa – business visa we paid application. So for 2 of us, I think it cost us 2500 rnb so thats $500AUD. And IELTS – in China it was more expensive – I think 400 something in China –  $350. Medical check, so twice for me and then plus Joy. For family its more expensive. I think it cost us for 2 of us – mine was 600 something – we used BUPA, it was quite expensive 600 + 2 + 3 and this is the most expensive one – employer. So student visa we paid $500, employer nomination we paid $2000 and our employer paid $6000 for the training fees, and then student visa – so these two I think is nearly 600. And then here its 600 as well. The good thing for research student is that husband and dependent – they are free so that’s $600 as well. Oh insurance money – that’s the biggest amount and tuition fees. So insurance for the first one for 3 years, I think we paid $15k as a family. Its insane. But now we are paying more. So, for PhD we paid 20000 – insane right.And then tuition fee – Masters - $25000 and then second year its half – I was lucky. Luckily for PhD the tuition fee was waived and we got the scholarship and cover for 1 persons insurance. Childcare – so Joy attending childcare since she was 10 months old. So, now shes 3.5. I think the first year I think its only 10-12 so that’s 1 year old. I think 2000 something. 2nd and 3rd and (roughly per year) – for childcare the same amount as my tuition fee. Its that much. So, every penny we earned, its back in Australia. So we checked our bank account actually. If we look exactly now back to 4 years ago, we have the same saving. So 4 years passed, we spent all the money we earn here and the savings were all gone in between. This savings which is saved gradually, a little bit by the time. That’s insane right!?

I only look at his registration number to look at whether he is a legal registered agent. That’s the only think I looked at. That was a huge mistake. So, looking back I think I should use those kind of networks more wisely. Actually, I think there bare some Chinese migration forums online – I don’t remember what they are called. I think tick tak world visa. I used this type of websites to check some requirements when I was free before I come here. But I think very limited. That’s a mistake. I should use that more wisely, definitely and do my research.Currently I didn’t do any research at all. I just go, you know, I finish my study and then I would do everything by myself thoroughly and prepare that. I know its that – maybe it’s a mistake as well. Maybe we should think about migration from now as a starting point because it takes time and its constantly changing. I don’t know. Its just that I don’t have time for that. Its more concerning of psychological, emotional management than time consuming actually. I think if I squeeze the time to do research, maybe I can do that. Its just, keeping up with all of these changes is so – like – driving me crazy. If I start to do this process and then they just suddenly change, so like, whats the point. I do all this preparation and its for nothing.\n",

We can see whats wrong in there but our friends, our family sitting there – they couldnt see it. That was kind of our motivation to stay here. I just feel like they were driving by – not social media – by the media, by politics, by everything in this huge bubble but they were so much in it, they couldn’t see that. And we were there from here coming over there, you know, after 4 years, we can actually see that, there’s a huge bubble – for housing, for property, for education and all the anxiety and depression they are feeling daily. They didn’t express but they , like you can feel it, when you are with them. Everybody is in, so quick pace, they were rushing to work, rushing to school, rushing to finish everything, rushing to..I don’t know, theyre just rushing. They never even stop and think why we are doing this. Whats the point of docing this.

And then one of my colleagues, he was also looking for options, he said why don’t you think about Australia, ancd universities in UK. And I was like, No I don’t wanna go there, and he said like well whats wrong with it. You can apply and then think about whether you wanna go or not. So then I applied in Monash and that was quite an easy process and after 4 months, I got the scholarship and.. I was like oh, that was like, I wasn’t prepared for it… I wasn’t ready because after getting so many rejections, I was like not expecting that I will get it. But anyways, so then I thought about it for 3 days to decide whether I will take it because I never wanted to go to Australia. I don’t know why. Just because I thought maybe geographically it is too far and Canada – I have other expectations or an image about the education system there compared to Australia. Anyway, I decided, because I didn’t have any other opportunities and I had to do my PhD. Then I started applying for visa and.. it was quite easy for me because I was fully funded and I didn’t need much like bank statements, I already had IELTS – that was part of my journey for applying for different universities.

She said that you have a great idea and it was very much aligned with her research that was recently published. So, and then she said like, you need to do this.. and.. that. And within a few minutes she refined my proposal, and transformed my idea into a working proposal and she was like yes you can apply here but I am not sure about funding. That was the point when I got excited about this PhD thing and I got some connections as well and I started writing more seriously, and I started applying.

So they were quite against my job as well because before me there was no precedent. So they were like shes wasting time. We don’t know why she is doing this job and there are these proposals there. But anyway, I didn’t pay attention to that and I kept looking around for opportunities and I never got any emotional or financial support from my family. So now, when I got it, that was the time when they got excited and said oh she was actually doing something for the past 3 years because before that they did not know what I was doing… whenever I would go to office from 9 to 6, they would say like, what is this! They were like, accepting of this thing that I am moving, I am going and then they started taking pride in me, and told other family members as well that look, she’s doing well. Well, let me just add here that the family that I am talking about is my grandparents and my uncles – my maternal uncle because my parents are – my mother died when I was 13 and my father, I mean, I don’t live with him, we just couldn’t get along well with him so we just moved, I and my sister, we moved to our grandparents house. So I am talking about that family. So, yeah, I mean, then after a lot of struggle, doing everything on my own and trying to find ways and guidance within my group – friends and my family, I think I made it. Now they are quite happy about it that she has done something with her life and we are very proud of her. Otherwise when I was into my job they were just thinking its not something worthy but now they tell this to everyone that oh Ryma is doing really well, shes in Australia or shes doing her PhD and yeah. In terms of support, they didn’t really give any support to me but now they are happy where I ended up and of course then I got married, so they are even more happy.  \n",

He was very supportive and I think that its his support that I had earlier as well until now due to which I have come this far otherwise I would’ve surrendered. He really supported and even his family. They are all very educated and they didn’t mind that you know, daughter in law is doing something else and going abroad alone, so they didn’t have any issues. One of the person who means a lot to me in this entire process of about 4 to 5 years of my life, the credit goes to my husband. \n",

But, I am not very comfortable with them so but I mean, they connected me with some other people or if I need to ask something or if I ever come to Sydney I can stay with them, with their family and he gave me contacts of his friends who are living in Melbourne and if I need something I can just call them. And one of them is an immigration lawyer as well so he was like oh if you need something, anything, any information, if you plan to stay here, apply for immigration, you can come to me. So that was one. And then when I was deciding to select my accommodation I was quite upset. I was like oh I don’t know where to live and I don’t know what Melbourne is, and because in Melbourne I don’t have any family or friends. Then my husband, he called me. He mentioned that his niece lives here in Melbourne and maybe I can stay with her 1 or 2 weeks while I find my own accommodation. Then he spoke to his niece and she contacted me that okay we can pick you up from the airport and you can come and stay with us as long as you want and in the mean while you can find your own accommodation. So I was like, okay great. So that’s how I developed a few contacts in Melbourne and it was very nice of them because when I arrived here at midnight she came to pick me up with her small kid who was sleepy, and, she still came to pick me up. And due to her I had access to the Pakistani community as well. So she made my early time in Melbourne very nice. Otherwise if I had to stay somewhere else on my own then probably it wouldn’t have been the same. \n",

So, yeah, I think I am skilled. I have done my Masters; I have this qualification and now I am doing my Postgraduate studies so it means that I am skilled. What else do I need to have to be skilled! I started applying to universities in 2017. 2017 October I applied and in March I got rejection from all of them and then I applied only in Monash. Before that I applied in Canada only. Then in August I applied in Australia, in one university and October I applied to a university in UK and by that time I got a reply from Australia. So, it took me like almost a year to find an opportunity. That was also hard, like applying and then requesting feedback, like what was wrong with my application, for admissions, especially for North America. They don’t want your proposal for the research... they just want your motivation because they have first 3 years of coursework and then 3 years of research so they want you to come here and learn these courses and then develop a project rather than coming with a proposal. So, I had to write like, many, letters. I still remember on my computer I had like xyz for every university that I applied for like, this university is looking for this, the other is looking for that and I almost spent like a $2000 on just application because there are application fees like $100, oo 90 pounds, or $110. I almost, almost lost $2000 on these applications. Here in Monash there is no fee but for North American and UK universities, I had to pay that. I was like Oh My God, I cant do this anymore.\n",

But I haven't did what Australia immigration policy is and how long it will take, am I eligible or not? I don't know about it, and I didn't explore it. I’ll use the other colour for Canada. I'm applying to Canadian express entry thing, and recently I got invitation to apply and now I'm just gathering my documents. Yeah, and then I'll just send them away. And then let's see what happens. But before getting this ITA, it was a very, very rigorous and stressful process. IELTS - Oh, my God I had to take is because they demand general IELTS, not academic one. So I mean, I couldn't clear it in the first attempt, the second time. I had to do it the second time. Then thankfully I cleared it but I had to pay seven 750 something 750 dollars for it.\n",

      "R:\tLast year when I was in Pakistan, one of my friend, a very good friend of mine, she came to my office and she said, Oh, I've got PR of Canada and I was like Wow. Because I think I am the kind of person or maybe because of my experiences with family with some with the Pakistani society in general, I always knew that I cannot live in Pakistan. Maybe because of because I think I'm misfit for that society. And also after visiting some countries abroad, I was like, you know, you know, when they say the Pakistani families used to say, Dimagh kharab ho gaya hai iska [she has gone crazy]. So yeah, my dimagh [mind] was actually I mean, I was like, so keenly into this right, I just want to move either to England or any secular society, free society to experience freedom. So yeah, I knew that I I'll have to apply for immigration at some point of my life. But I but I didn't know where, how, when. So when my friend told me that she got PR for Canada. I was like, I got very excited and I asked her to share with me all the details. How can I get into this? Then she shared her experience and she told me it's very easy, it will take six months and it's the cost is very minimum. Otherwise I always thought maybe immigration requires that you have to spend a lot of money and you need to have certain funds to show and I of course I didn't have it. And I knew my family's not going to help me with that as well. So I was like Wow, that's that's quite reasonable because she she she told me that I mean, the application fees is like 50,000 rupees would be $500 Yeah. So I was like yeah, I can manage that. I mean, it's not difficult and then but then she said, I mean, first you need to get your IELTS and then another important thing was that education equivalency report. Education equivalency. It requires So do you have to submit your degrees your transcripts to a Canadian assessment authority? Yeah, something like that. That’s called world education system so they assess your degree and and make a report if equivalency if your masters it is equivalent to Canada's masters or not, and they just generate that report and for immigration we need that report. So yeah, I applied for that. I mean, right this is the process. This is the time when she was telling me that this is this, these are the steps that you have to take to apply for immigration, that was in 2018. But I applied actually recently, like three months ago. So I spent, I think $300 on this process as well. That's called Wes education, equivalency system system. And it did cost me $300. But it was like, I mean, I was like, okay, that's fine. I can do this. And then she said, when you do these things first because you need good score in IELTS, otherwise your points will be very low. So I was like, Okay, I'll do it later. But I was excited, that okay. I mean, within my given means, I can apply for Canadian immigration. But at the same time, I was into that, applying for PhD things as well. So my entire focus was on PhD, not on immigration. But once I got in and I came here, then I started thinking about immigration as well. And within my second, I think, yeah, in March, I came here in February. And in March, I gave my first IELTS exam because I mean, I knew that I'm, I am going to apply for immigration. And because my I got married in January before coming here, and my in laws are in Canada, so for my husband, it's like, yeah, we will have to go to Canada as well. So I mean, let's see if we can stay there or not. But let's apply for immigration, because his family's there too. So yeah, he also motivated me that yes, we can apply. So I am basically the primary applicant and we both applied together. So yeah, so so far, I spend on IELTS, then on my degrees, recently, oh my god, that was horrible - I had to spend $680 for my medical check. That’s too much. And he was like, What the fuck, and in Pakistan that's a cheap, it's like only 200 or 250. dollars. And here it was like 680. And I was like, oh my god. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "R:\tYeah, and during this process, I was also worried about the funds that they demand as a statement that you need to have if you're coming as a couple that you must have almost $18,000 CAD so I was like, Oh, I don't have this much money. And my husband also, I mean, even if we put it together if, I mean together, our funds were not enough. So I was so upset. I was literally so stressed…entire week, I couldn't focus on my proposal and stuff and I was like, What am I going to do? I don't know. But then I again, kept on talking to my friend who got her PR last year. She was like, well, you borrow from your friends from your family because I also did the same. I was just like, I mean, who's gonna give me this much money? I mean, are you serious? She said, I mean, talk to your family. Maybe they'll give you or something. But then, I mean, of course, I didn't talk to my family. So yeah, what I did was because I've also developed some friends here, I have developed some connections… that was through that accommodation finding thing. So I have a friend whom I met in Italy, he connected me with her friend who was doing PhD in Melbourne Uni. So she contacted me and she said, I'm leaving this place. If you want to have this and you can, you can. So, then she also shared some other accommodation options to me. And then I end up meeting an Indian woman who is from Brisbane and her brothers houses here near to the uni’s side. I went to her she was very nice to me and I sort of like connected you know, I felt like oh, I mean, okay, there are people who are very caring, who were very loving. So that was the only time I met her and then we were connected through Facebook and that's it. And then I met her last week as well. And I shared that I'm applying to Canada and I don't know what to do. I mean, I don't have money. I was considering to apply for a loan here. Or I was I didn't know why I never used a credit card. So I was like if I can apply for credit card because she also works for the bank. So she explained everything to me that I may not be eligible for credit card because credit card is only for purchases. If you want to have the other credit card to give you cash, then you need to be either permanent resident or some something else. I was like, Oh, damn, but she offered me that I can give you some money if you just needed to keep it in your bank account. I was like, Oh my god, you saved us… I was like, I mean, I'm so relieved. But still, I mean, even if even after adding her money, I was still, I didn't have enough. So I mean, that day, my another friend who who is doing masters here and she came to my office randomly because we had planned for dinner. So she was she asked me what happened. You look so stressed. I said, I'm and this is the issue I'm having. Without any, you know, expectation…I just shared that this is… this is what's going on in my life. She said, I have money I can give you. Why didn't you ask me? I said, I mean, I never thought about it. I was like, I mean, why why anyone would give me money? I mean, you need I mean, of course, I mean, first you have to have that trust thing, then of course you will transfer money in someone's account. So, she said, No, you can have it because I have this much amount and I'll just pay my fees. I mean, and even then I have sufficient amount. So, if you need it for three, four months, you can have it. So, I was like, Oh my god, I never asked people. I have this kind of thing that I don't ask people that I need help. So yeah, then she helped me. And then, now, my funds are sufficient enough. Yeah. But that entire week was very stressful that I didn't know what I'm going to do. \n",

      "\n",
      "R:\tOh, well, my friend who's got her PR she said I mean, I mean the day you apply for you submit your documents and everything. If you just take out the money out straight away, that's fine. But once they start the process, they might ask you to submit a fresh statement because they need just a statement a piece of paper, they are not looking into your accounts. I mean, yeah, online and stuff. So, but when they ask to submit it again, then it might create issue for you. So therefore, it's better to leave it in the aacount for two or three months or until your application is finalized. \n",

      "\n",
      "R:\tAnd what else Yeah, that was the most dreadful period during the entire application process. Then to make something beautiful, yeah. Yeah. And then, um, there's another thing. I mean, before submitting my documents I have to pay the immigration fees. One is the application fees, and other is permanent residency fees, right, which they give you option that either paid now, or you can pay when we’ll decide, Okay, we're going to give you PR, but it is mentioned on their website that if you pay this fees at this stage, then your application will be, you know, your process will be quicker. So, I don't know if it really is but I mean, this is how they're convincing people to pay up front. Yeah. Which is $1100 dollars. It's a money game. So I have to pay that as well this is something that you pay when submit your all documents, right okay, so since I was gathering all the documents for example my police check, my IELTS, then my medical and then my experience letters - I had to call my previous employers requesting them please… For God's sake For God's sake, give me my experience letter, my reference letter but on these formats, so yeah, it also took like two to three weeks and I still haven't got one from one of them so I have to just write to them today that please for God’s sake.\n",

But in terms of Canada, the main main hurdle was this financial thing and showing funds. Otherwise, yeah, it is IELTS I mean, I don't know what's the matter with it because I thought I'm good with English. But when I did this, I didn't get the desired score. So, I had to pay for it again. Then I had to practice because I thought, okay, I didn't practice last time. I was like over, you know, I thought, Oh, I know everything. So now I should spend some time in practicing. And yeah, and spent another 350 dollars in going to the city from here and taking the test and yeah, that was one thing which which I find stressful emotionally because then the whole period of those five days when I was waiting for my result, every night I was like Oh What if I, if I didn't get the desired results of this time then do I have to apply again? I was like very upset with it. And then I mean, thankfully I cleared. So then I was relieved but then the next hurdle was this statement things. So yeah, but somehow sorted out due to my friends.\n",

      "R:\tI practiced on my own online, yeah, on IELTS website. So it was like, I was practicing a few modules, only reading and writing. my first test my writing was like 6.5 and I needed seven. But in the second test I got seven in that. But for listening, I mean, the, the requirement for the immigration is that you have to have 8. I had 8.5 in my initial test, but I didn't have seven in my writing. So, I was like, Okay, I fucked up. But yeah, next time I was like, the same scoring but some, you know, improvement in writing. That’s it. My priority was PhD and not immigration. So and I was in the phase of getting admission somewhere. So, and I got it. So I thought why to lose this opportunity and apply for PR.. I don't know if Ill get it or not, but something which I have, tangible - So there is no I mean logic to let it go. So therefore, I chose Australia for PhD. And after I mean, I know that after doing this PhD, I don't want to go back to Pakistan. So that's why I started thinking about applying to immigration and Canada, I mean, because I didn't explore anything about Australia and Canada is something where my husband's family is. So we have that family support family connection. So maybe that's why we're thinking about Canada only and not Australia, but I don't know, maybe after this application I might apply for New Zealand.

So therefore, we decided that we need to go to a developed country which offers citizenship. Because Yeah, otherwise, I mean, there's no future in Middle East. So, having a different passport is a powerful thing now in especially coming from a country which has a very bad history and negative, you know, in association with this country, so therefore it's important to change the passport.

It's also the society in general that you, you see a lot of harassment on streets. You see, there's no respect for women, for girls. And there is no equality. There's so much politics. And it was like too much for me. And I was like, No, I don't want my life and my future in this kind of environment anymore. In this scared, closed, introverted environment where the girls are not allowed to express. And I mean, same as the case with the boys as well in some situations, but I mean for girls, it's very, very hard to break the barriers and do whatever they like. So that is the reason I, I felt when I was in England, I felt the very first thing that I noticed when I landed on airport was the gender unconsciousness. And that was my first ever exposure to this thing. I didn't know that I was like, oh, everybody's going to look at me everybody's going to stare at my ass and my body. But nobody cares. And that was so fascinating. That I was like, wow, I mean, what kind of world it is. I just want to stay here. But yeah, that's the main reason that I feel freedom is that where you live the way you want to live without being scared or judged by any one.\n",

So, I realised that here in Australia, doing a PhD – the government finds it. Whereas, in the UK you need to get like, a student loan and I didn’t want to commit to a loan so – that’s actually the most important reason as to why I migrated to Australia. I wanted to get my PhD. That’s the most important thing. I migrated to UK as a student even though my mom is a citizen there but in UK you need to have gotten in.. or moved down before you were 18. After 18 it becomes a lot difficult. So, I had to apply as a student. But after the student visa, I waited further to get my indefinite leave to stay there forever. But, when I realised that coming to Australia, I’m able to do my PhD for free, I decided to move. \n",

      "O:\t2006. So from 2006, my BSc, I think I finished in 2009, and I did my Masters. I finished in 2010. Then, 2011 2012, I worked a little bit with British Telecom in the UK and that’s when I got the world bank job. So, I moved back to Nigeria because the project was focused on in Nigeria and Kenya. So, I moved down there. So, I was working on the project coz it was funded by the world bank and CFI. CFI is the – they provide aids to African countries on behalf of the British government so I was actually moving from Nigeria to UK but I was actually working closely with Nigeria. So yea, from 2012 to 2015, no 16, I was pretty much in Nigeria. Then I moved back to UK. I did some work but before then, prior to then, I think around 2013, that was when I actually got my PR for Australia. So, because my wife, she actually studied here at The university of Queensland. That’s where she finished. But when she finished reading there, she went back to Nigeria. So, she was the one who told me how beautiful Melbourne was, and I decided to give it a try. So, 2013, that is when I actually applied for the PR, the 189 visa, and I got it in 2013 but they give you 5 years basically, to prepare your properties to sell, etc. After I got it, I came to Melbourne just for like, 2 weeks, just to see whether I liked it and I did. So, I went back to Nigeria then continued my World bank job. Then 2018 – that was when the 5 year period that they gave me was going to expire. So, I decided to move. I think I actually entered Australia 2 days before it was going to expire, and the guy looked at me at the border and was like, “did you actually wait 5 years”. I was like well!! Laughs.\n",

But, I did it just for like, a year and then I moved into Business Analyst because I just tired of writing codes. I became a Business Analyst. Then, when I with World Bank in Nigeria I was a BA, but then I moved to be a product owner and product manager, then project manager. So, I was more or less managing the IT intervention. With the WB role, they had different interventions and each of the intervention, they used different IT companies. So, I was like, the IT manager. Even though I do a little bit of Business Analysis – I try to map the processes from A to Z. But I also liked the product owner, the whole signing off any development. I was pretty much the IT manager and also the Business Analyst. That’s always been what I have been doing. So, when I moved down to Australia, the first place where I worked was a government agency in Victoria. It was pretty much similar to what I was doing in Nigeria. What they do in Film Victoria is that they support people from the entertainment industry and the games industry. You submit an idea. You submit online, and if its good enough, the Victorian government will give you money. So, the idea is to bring the movies you wanna shoot, you bring it Victoria. That way, they can create jobs, they give you incentives to bring your productions down to Australia. That way, you give people jobs and train people how to shoot movies, and how you do all these things.  So, it was pretty much similar to what I was doing in Africa where the wold bank supports the business plan. If its good enough, they give you the grant to support your business. So, I was able to fit into that job because, yeah, maybe it’s a different sector, its still the same process. The technology is the same. \n",

I was a bit tired of UK because I was writing codes and it was just all getting a bit boring for me you know; at that stage of my life I just wanted to explore and do something different. So, when she told me, I was like okay maybe I should give it a try. I’ll see how it is. I mean, I’ve been hearing about Australia, but I’ve never dreamt about going there. So, it was just out of, it was…just for fun. Yeah, and within 2 months or 3 months I got it. So, it wasn’t… there wasn’t a drive for me to do it. I just did it out of pleasure and I got it.

So, right now I’m a member and what we do is we just give people advice on how to make their journey. So, I think the forum was very very helpful to a lot of Nigerians trying to migrate to USA, to Canada, to Australia. You know, there are different people there. You just post your questions and they add things. I also used a lot of forums on British expats so another forum. So, most of the research was online. I got most of the things online. I checked online everything they wanted. I ensured I ticked all the boxes they had coz it was the points-based system, so you need to be between a certain age range, you need to have certain level of experience, education etc. So, you get points for all these things.

I was like, I’m tired of UK. I just want to do something different. So, well, but they supported me. I was like if I go to Australia, I can get to do my PhD, and spend as little as possible rather than get a loan in the UK. So, yeah, they supported me and assisted me, and whatever I asked them, they were able to assist me. We are 4 boys, and I am the last one. Yeah, so, one of my brothers stays in the UK now.

But, when I got the PR, the 5 year gap, I started knowing some friends, yeah I knew the medical doctor in Geelong, now has his own practice, So, I started knowing people bit before I made the application, I did not know anyone.

Oh my friends study in Australia, oh my wife is there. So, I think it started happing because I started telling people that I’ll probably be moving to Australia soon. So that’s pretty much how. \n",

      "O:\tSo, the problem is that, like, I’ve learnt that the hard way, I think, information is very important. So, when I applied for it, we were not married. We were just dating. So, I didn’t know that you could actually add, there’s something called the de facto. I didn’t know about that. I just thought that you have to be married. So, I didn’t add her to my application. I actually mentioned that I dated her. I just didn’t add her as an applicant. So, if I had known I would have added her to my application but I didn’t know. So, I applied separately. So, I tried as much as it was possible to try and see if I could add her but I couldn’t. Some people told me that it’s better that I moved down to Australia first, get myself an apartment. It will show that I have something, that I can take care of them. So, at one point, I just thought about maybe I should cancel the one I did and apply a new one and I could include her. But then I was like I don’t wanna go through that whole thing again and spend $6000 again. So I was like, okay I’ll just go first on my own. So now, I started asking questions to people so they can advise me what I should do because, and, honestly that was one of the reasons why I didn’t move. Like, it took me 5 years to move because I was thinking that do I wanna leave all these things that I’m doing, I have a great job at world back, so do I wanna leave that and stay away from my family for more than a year? And for what? And it was not like I am desperate, you know, like, do I wanna go through all this pain? And, I was just like, you know, God wanted me to move to Australia. That’s why I got it very easily. And someone advised that another option for me was to start the whole process again and I was like, no I don’t think so. So, she’s in the UK. She’s just waiting for her visa to come through. She’s on the, coz I’m on the indefinite leave, she’s on that too. It’s like the permanent residence, but it’s not like the PR, like you can stay in the UK for ever, and after a while you can apply for a citizenship. I never got it before I left because I just never cared much about it. As long as it gives you the opportunity to stay forever, so, that was fine by me. And now I don’t care for it too much because I don’t wanna be jumping around. \n",

      "O:\tActually, I did. I looked at different options. There was a state nomination coz then I was. You know, it’s all about the points. Even though, I got the points based on my years of experience, my age, my school, I was lucky to also go to a school, like you get additional points if your school is one of the top universities in the world, you get 5 points – then. I don’t know about now but then, if you school was amongst the top 400 you get extra 5 points. So, yeah, it’s all about information. I went to University Essex and it was in the top so I got additional 5 points for that. I did all the calculations. I needed 65 points. So, I got the 65 points but for you to get nominated – it is based on the number of your points – the higher, the better. So, I said to myself, ah, maybe I just should go and do IELTS coz if I do IELTS, and I pass it, I can get up to 20 PR 10 points. So, the thing is, because Nigeria, we are English speaking and maybe because I was in the UK, I didn’t need it. Coz, I remember I actually asked, and they said I didn’t need it. I don’t know. Again, that’s the question – who needs IELTS? I just know I didn’t need it. I just did it coz I could add more points. I actually did it twice, so crazy!. So basically, you can’t score below 7 in each band. The first time I scored 8 in each band and I scored 6.5 in the listening and that invalidates you. And I was like, are you sure you’re just not trying to make me do it for a second time. So, I did it again and I scored better. So, I scored 10 points more from IELTS. I thought about the state sponsorship but I realised for the state sponsorship, the requirements for IELTS was a bit low so I considered that and one of my friends has a brother who is a medical doctor. He actually went through the state route. I think it was based on, I think it was for Canberra. I think he only recently moved down to Melbourne after he finished the 3 years. So, I thought about that. But, the thought of restricting myself somewhere for 2 years, I don’t like it. I like being free, you know. If I’m tired of Melbourne, I can decide to move down to Sydney. If I’m tired of Sydney, I can decide to go to Canberra. So, I didn’t like the thought of staying somewhere for 2 years. What if I can’t find a job where I am that I like? That’s why I said, okay, let me just do the 189 so I’m free, I can go anywhere I choose to go. \n",

So, I realised its either Sydney or Melbourne. Most of the other places like Tasmania is more on tourism, hospitality, and that’s not what I do. So, I studied for Sydney and Melbourne. The problem of Sydney is that – when I research between Sydney and Melbourne, which one is better – and everyone was like, ah Sydney is like London. So busy, and everyone is working, and you have to move fast. I didn’t like that vibe. That’s why I got tired of the UK. It was too fast for me. It’s like Nigeria in Lagos, everything is so fast. You need to be street-wise, you need to be so sharp and I don’t like that. I like Melbourne – its relaxed, its laid back. So yeah, I just decided I’ll stay in Melbourne. But its changing. I was telling my friend that when I came in 2014 – it was so calm and I was like “oh I love this place” and when I came in 2018, I’m like, “really! Whats going on here, It’s so busy”.  \n",

So, basically you serve your country for a year. If you graduate before the age of 40, you need to serve the country. So, the whole idea is to find a way to integrate everyone. So they, if you’re like, from the West – I’m from the West – Lagos, they send you to another region of the country. So, that way you try to understand the cultures, and you get to integrate. It is good but I think that because they want to encourage foreign students so when you come, they give you the liberty to choose where you wanna go. When I went, I just decided that I was gonna choose Abuja. Abuja is the central capital. Its mandatory. Like, for example, the world bank job that I did, I wouldn’t be able to do that if I had not done the NYSE. You must have it. As long as you graduated before the age of 40, you must do the NYSE, else, you can’t hold a position in Nigeria. We do military training for 3 weeks out of the 1 year. Sometimes, they post you at a school – you get to teach people, do ICT stuff, they can post you to hospitals, to banks. So, they can post you anywhere for work for rest 11 months. But, for 1 month you do para-military training. I went back to Nigeria for the youth service. So, 2012, I finished it in 2012 and I went back to UK. I was working with British Telecom. I worked there for 2 years till 2014, and I went back to Nigeria. So, 2014, I went back to Nigeria. So, I applied for  - so, 2013 – that was when I applied for my PR. So, I think that should come first. So, that’s when I applied for it. So, after I got the PR, I still went back to Nigeria. So, 2014-2018, I was working the world bank job in Nigeria.

I know you can apply, and it takes 14-19 months, but I thought there should be another way to do it. Unfortunately, now I know that that was one of my biggest mistakes. If I had known that I would have just stuck to my online research because the agent – well – she was gonna do the application for me and she was gonna charge like, $3000 or $4000. She’s actually based in Sydney. When I told her, oh actually I’m a graduate, I can read, I did my PR myself, I can do it myself. So, rather than speaking $3000-4000, I can do it myself. So, she wasn’t very happy about it. So, she probably didn’t give me as much information as she should have given me. For example, when I was concerned that now I am waiting for that 14 months to 19 months, is there any way to bring my wife to come join me temporarily?, and everyone I spoke to – were like, the fact that you’ve applied for her, the partner visa, if you now apply for a visitor visa, the immigration will know that you want this woman to just come and meet you cox they’ll see that application and most likely will reject it. So, then like, mostly what agents advise before was that she should apply for the visitor visa first. When she’s in the country, you apply for the partner visa. That way, she goes into the bridging. The agent I spoke to, the lawyer, she didn’t tell me any of this. I applied last year August so it’s going to be one year. I paid the lawyer for the consultation. I paid $200 for one hour. We have to go to the court to certify all my documents. I also paid to the ACS – I think I paid about $400 to validate my degree. I paid for police reports – I needed from both the UK and Nigeria. Let’s just say 100 pounds. Let’s just say $30 for documents certification. IELTS was like $150 each so $300 for IELTS. Medical was roughly about $200. And then my wife and child had to do this – yeah yeah. In fact, that is what is getting me. Currently, we did the medical and the document certification, and the police report, and I read online that sometimes it only lasts for 12 months. That means, we’ll have to do it again. Coz she, she’s a diplomat, and ambassador. So, she actually stayed in Pakistan, in Islamabad. So, she went through a lot to actually get the police report. She just got it, actually, just last month. So, it took her about 5-6 months to get it. So, when I read online about 12 months, to actually go through that process again, I’m worried – I don’t even wanna think about that, to get that Pakistan one. I mean, the Nigerian and UK were were okay. But the Pakistan one, I don’t wanna go through it again. Yes. So, her degree was actually, between Pakistan and Australia. So, she did 2 years in Pakistan and the third year in Australia. So, I think it was a joint collaboration between the university in Pakistan and the university in Australia. She did IELTS as well because I remember she was bragging that she scored better than me. My daughter also had to do the medicals. She’s 4. Probably I spend about $400 for medical for both of them. What about the fees for the spouse visa? That’s the biggest one. It was $7600. I paid like, $9000 something for my daughter and wife – that’s what I paid. I was like what! I was thinking it was better she applied while I was still in Nigeria. But, most of my friends said it would be difficult because they expect you as a sponsor, to be in Australia, to have settled down. So, that was why we did it this way. The five years that were waiting, maybe we should have done it. But it would have been very difficult. Then I travelled back to UK and Nigeria to go see them because I was missing them. And I’m still thinking of visiting them this year in Christmas as well. That’s expenses – that’s part of it. It’s a lot. It’s not easy.  I think it’s about $2000 for every return journey. I had to pay for biometrics. But that wasn’t expensive. That was like $150. \n",

      "O:\tI used two online blogs – Nairaland – it is very popular in Nigeria. I also used British Expats. So, both of them are like blogs. So, people share ideas on their journeys, their timeline. How they applied for their visa, you know, just the journey they went through to get their visa. Those 2 blogs were the 2 that I used extensively. I’m actually still active on Naira land. Now I tend to give advice to people. So, now I tell people, hey if you’re married, put your wife on your application. Now, I’m actually active. I don’t know much about other visa’s but now I do know about the 189 PR route. Its one forum but there are different threads. So, there’s a thread for Canada, there a thread for America, there’s one for Australia. So, I only post on the Australia one. Even the UK, I don’t know much because when I did the student visa, I was young. The Australia one, I did myself. The UK one, my mom, my dad, they did the application for me. Apart from Nairaland, now there’s a WhatsApp group. So, those of them who moved from Nigeria to Australia, and used Nairaland, so theres a WhatsApp group. We all chat about the experiences and all that. But, it’s strictly for those who have been successful in their journey to discuss experiences of moving, finding work and so on. It was actually from there that I learnt that I should have actually applied for the partner. There are some people on the group who are actually migration agents, but I didn’t know that. So, they were the ones that were telling me, Oh the agent you spoke to didn’t do justice. They help you to get cheap houses once you’re in Australia, how to get cheap cars. I think it’s a closed group. And, its about 150 users. It is invite only. So, once you tell them that you came from Nairaland, they ask you for your name on Naira Land. Everyone has a unique name on Naira Land. So, they’re going to check you out to see that truly you used to comment on the thread, and from there they will add you to the group. I never met anyone from the group physically. The first person I met was just 3 days ago. He is here for like 3 or 4 years, but he’s been finding it difficult to get a job. So, I told him that I’m lucky, I’ve not only been here 3 years and I’ve already changed jobs twice. So, I was telling him maybe you can do you CV differently. It’s more like a data science CV but I think right now, a lot of people are looking for BA, BI. I just tried to help him do his CV to get a job. So he’s the only person I actually met. Mostly, we just communicate online.\n",

      "O:\tWhen I got here in April, I was lucky, maybe because I was in a strategic position where I was working at. So, they actually allowed me to work remotely. So, even when I was in Australia, I was still working for the World bank project. So, I didn’t need to get a job. I told my wife that I’m just gonna finish the project… Its gonna be different because of the time zones and all. When its morning in Australia its night in Nigeria. So, I was like, I’m gonna be working 24 hours. So, for the first 2 months, I don’t even wanna work in Australia. I’m just gonna focus on my project and apply for my DL, get an apartment, you know, just settle in. So, for the first 2 months I didn’t really apply for any jobs. I was just doing the work I had. So, at some point, I started getting a bit bored. Yeah, when I moved here, one of my friends, that someone introduced me to. He was staying in Point cook. So, I stayed in his house for 2-3 months before I got my apartment. So, even though I said I wasn’t gonna apply for a job, but you know in the morning, he was living with his wife, so they both go to their workplace and I’m the only one who’s home. And I was like, uhh, even though I was working on the project, it was just so boring.  So, after about 2 months, I started applying. It was too boring for me – this is gonna kill me. So, I started learning some things. I was getting these rejection emails – oh sorry, we found a better candidate bla bla bla. I was like, I’m very qualified, like, whats happening. I realised that a lot of these companies, if you don’t have local experience, it’s difficult to get a job and I don’t like it because IT is a general language. Whether, it is in India, Pakistan, Nigeria – it is the same code. So, I just, I didn’t understand the whole rationale behind local experience. So as I was doing that, I saw this ad for this charity, they work for vulnerable women and children who are exposed to domestic violence. So, they try to teach them how to defend themselves – so self-awareness and self-defence classes. So, you come to them and then they assess you and realise oh you have issues, they out you through to some self-defence classes to boost your self-confidence. And so, I saw the ad online that they were looking for research analyst. So, I sent my CV to her and she liked it. She called me for an interview, and I got it. So that actually kept me engaged for that period while I was home. I advised them how can do things differently, for example they can have a website where people can fill a form, have a social media handle, people can always reach you online rather than come to your physical office. So, I did a lot of research and also helped them define the process. I’m actually still doing it. It’s a pro bono thing so whenever they need my service, I try to help them. I actually got my first job in 3 months and this volunteer work helped coz even when I went for my interview for the government job, I was one the top and it came down to my references. So, I gave them a reference from my World Bank job and mostly Nigeria and UK and they were like, no we need an Australian reference. I’m like, you saw in my CV, I never worked in Australia, how can I give you an Australian reference. So the guy was like, see, he liked me, I was a top applicant, so he said even if it’s a friend. So, I then realised that I can ask the lady from the charity work I am doing. So, she said yes, shes gonna be my reference. So they used her and one of my UK references. \n",

      "O:\tMost of the influence that technology has had was when I got here. So, when I got here, like I told you, I was getting a lot of rejection letters. So, I read online that sometimes you just go on LinkedIn and if you see someone, if you either worked together or went to the same university, you can just send a message to the person, chat with them and maybe have a coffee, try to see if they have an opening in their office and ask them to be a referral. So, I actually did that. The first person I met – I saw an opening in Commonwealth bank. They guy was from Nigeria and worked in Commbank so I was like hey bro, whats up man, can you just be a referral, and he said no he can’t do that. I was like why, and he was like coz he doesn’t know me. I was like, hey it’s not a reference, its just a referral – like you’re the one telling me to apply for this job. He said, yeah, he doesn’t feel comfortable. I was surprised, I was really really disappointed. But anyway, I actually met another guy. He’s a consultant. Hes a Nigerian – hes into ML. I saw him on Social media, and I messaged him and he was like yeah, come meet me for a coffee. So, I sat down with him and he just told me, like oh, the way you did your CV, it’s too – like in Australia, they wanna see your acheivements, like, whatever you have achieved. My CV was just like I worked there, this is what I did. So, I didn’t have a proper CV. So, while we were having this discussion, he realised that I was very good with some of the tools that they currently used in Australia – like CRM, tableau, but on my CV it wasn’t there. So, he was like you need to put all that on your CV, they like to see all that stuff here. So, I had to redo my CV and I ensured that I listed all those things, and yeah I got the job. So, social media mostly helped me after I moved here. You know, I always tell people that, information is the most important thing that anyone can have. You know why? You know when I moved down to Melbourne, I didn’t buy a car. It was only me so I was always jumping on the bus. And at some point I was like, my wife and my daughter will join me so I should just get a car. It took me about 6-7 months to get a car and the only reason was, I didn’t want to go through doing the driving test, and all that. I know I can drive. The guy I stayed with when I moved here told me that I need to do my driving test and all that. So, one day, I was just browsing online, and I realised that if you have a UK license, just take it there they can just swap it. Just that. I didn’t know that because the guy told me I have to go through the whole driving test. And I was like oh, I don’t wanna do that. I just wanna focus on my job, on my life, bring my family down. I don’t wanna go through this driving test. I can always just on the bus or tram and you know the funny thing, that this guy – so initially I thought oh maybe he doesn’t know this because he’s never been to the UK. But, his wife is actually American, so he told her the same thing. So, I took my UK licence and they swapped it, and gave me the Australian license. And I called him and said listen man, don’t tell your wife to go. And he was still arguing with me that No! that’s not possible. I just told him I just did it. He was telling me that he’s been living in Australia for 10 years and he knows. So, then the wife called me, and I told her that just pay the application fee, and they will change it. So, it was then I realised that information is very important. Sometimes, don’t just listen to what other people say, even if the person has been here for 10 years. Just research yourself, go online, ask questions. I can add LinkedIn on the map. \n",

      "O:\tI think the partner visa is crap. I mean, if theres, let me tell you something. I think about 2 months ago I sent an email to the MP – the local MP and like, how can you keep a family away for 2 years – a partner? That is breaking the whole family itself. What is the purpose of it. They were like, they look at it to validate if the marriage is genuine because theres a lot of scam. I was like, yeah but like, honestly, I’m talking to here one-on-one. Theres some arguments I am having with my wife and when I was in the UK and Nigeria with her, I didn’t have these arguments in her. But now, because of this visa theres a lot of frustration, like shes the only one taking care of the child, shes so tired coz she needs to work, shes got her own business – she does cupcakes, she takes the child to school, she works, does the housework, sometimes these little, little things, we have started arguing about it. When I was with her, we never argued so much. So, it actually causes a lot of triggers on small things, and I don’t understand why these guys don’t think about that. You are actually breaking a family with all these checks – youre breaking my family. For me, that is the part which is not fair, its not right. If I had known, honestly, that it was gonna be this difficult, I probably wouldn’t have moved to Australia. I would have just stayed in the UK. Why would I not want to stay with my family, my daughter, she’s just 3 years old. Its torture. I understand like yeah, okay maybe there’s a lot of scam going on, or things like arranged marriages, I understand. But, you cant punish genuine people. No matter what you tell me, when you keep families, especially newly married or young couple away fro so long, there is no way you are not breaking, like somehow, you are breaking their relationship. You are breaking the bond. You end up saying things to each other, yeah you’re angry but you still said it. And for me that’s the most, I don’t think it’s fair, and honestly to be frank with you, a lot of people I spoke to, they always think that Australia is more racist than other places, and its one of the reasons they feel that, especially when you’re from Africa, they feel that you’re not genuine. British people who apply for partner visas, some of them, they get it 4-5 or 6 months. So, why would someone from India, Pakistan, Nigeria spend 18 months – for what! Why? Its just nor fair. I know of people who applied from the UK and got it within 4-5 months. So, why should it be different – just because someone applied it from Africa or Asia. I don’t think its right. I got so frustrated; I actually wrote a letter to the MP. I was like listen man, if you don’t want people to come, how can you tell me, I’m an honest person, I came here, I work here, I pay my taxes. And the little thing, for me to bring my family, I can’t even enjoy it. Think about it – I resigned from my job, I decided to make the move thinking that would improve my life and be good for my family, and now I have to wait for 2 years to see them. It’s really not cool. \n",

That is what brought me to Australia. If I live here, and I don’t achieve it, I think I would have failed. I have to do it. That’s why I came. You know, women, my wife, she is telling me that make sure you don’t buy a house, we need to do it together. I don’t care. She needs to see the place.

I’m open to that. The good thing about world bank projects is that you can move around. But that would happen when my family is fully stabilised. I can’t do that now. Again, that’s one of the pain I am feeling with this kind of migration – it makes things difficult for me for planning. I love planning maybe because I’m a business analyst. I have to have a process in my head before I do anything. So, the whole migration stuff – because my wife if not here. It’s a bit difficult to make a definite plan. For example, I would have gotten a mortgage by now. My bank already offered me a loan to buy a house, but I don’t wanna do anything until my wife comes. My business, I’m thinking of starting a business in Australia – my wife – since she has this cupcake business, I’m thinking that we can partner together. I’ll do the IT part – IT and delivery, she can focus on the production of the cakes. So, we can work together. For me, it’s about the business.

      "H:\tSo, the whole academic background means that you get some options. You weigh the options and then it’s kind of a given that you will probably be moving countries every time you get a different appointment. So, I suppose it’s a little bit idiomatic in that sense. The main factors we considered at the time – there were a few things. So, first of all, the job was great. So, I really wanted to do the thing. So, this was basically when I was still in my career of astronomy. I had already done a Postdoc in the US and I was looking for the next step. We didn’t really want to stay in the US and there were a few factors – a few reasons for that, and we were looking for places that had a few of the things that kind of annoyed us about living in the US. One of the – so there are a few logistical reasons – very mundane things, not really emotional things. There was, first of all, there’s 2 of us and there’s one job offer. My wife didn’t have a job offer so were like okay, what is a place that won’t hassle her for employment. And, at the time Australia was possibly the only place - that where the spouse visa was completely free. You could do whatever you like, you know, work. We would’ve had that only in the EU otherwise because I’m an EU citizen. We could go to the EU and me and my wife could work there – just defacto. No hassle. But, in other places that’s not the case. In other places that we’ve lived even, that’s not the case. So, yeah weren’t looking at going back to Europe then. We were looking for another adventure. So, in here it was possible for my wife to get a job. So, that worked really well. Another thing that I considered at the time was basically long-term career stuff. This is previous career, obviously in science. So, I was thinking, you know, what is the place where there is decent Science funding, and at the time it was very good. You know 2012 – there were all these fellowships, they were open to everybody. Different discussion – obviously that changed after we got here. So, I think the facts at the time were career specific, opportunities for both of us, a place where cost of living wouldn’t be a huge problem for a Postdoc salary. In the short term, we didn’t know what our plans would be for the long-term. Obviously, Postdocs don’t make enough to live here long-term, buy houses, and all that stuff but for a 3-year contract it seemed fantastic and it was very good. And then, there were some other considerations that were – like once all these boxes were ticked then we thought about bigger things, you know, what are the – I realised, as I say this, it was so nerdy, so statistically kind of informed. So, everything was looking at like society stats. What is the Gini coefficient in Australian society like, things like that, coz – slight tangent but we lived in Chile for a while. It was a wonderful experience to live but the inequality is something that bothered me every day there. Even though our jobs were the jobs that were creating more equality, it was still very difficult to live in a place like that. So, I didn’t want to move to a place that, again, there would be so much inequality. So, that was a consideration and those kind of things. That’s the stuff that pops to mind. \n",

      "H:\tGreece. But I lived in Chile, in the UK for and US. It was all for Science. So, I went to the UK to study. Then, I went to Chile to do some extra projects for my PhD. Then I was in the US for a postdoc and UK for a postdoc. So, it was absolutely all for the Science career. Astrophysics. Now, [career] its so-called Data Science. So, umm, when was this, 4 years ago? Maybe May-ish, April, something like that of 15. I moved. Yeah, at that point everything changed. Now, the observatory I was working for doesn’t even exist anymore. It was a really famous observatory – like world famous research facility in Sydney. The headquarters were in Sydney. And, they disbanded the observatory. Thankfully, The Australian National University took over the telescope. So, the telescope is gone into good use. But, yeah, the shorter version of it is, the government changed a year after I moved, and everything changed. It was like, where there were all these opportunities, so much funding, the funding was cut. Where there were fellowships, the fellowship programs were cut and the ones that were maintained were only open to Australian citizens. So, I wasn’t eligible to apply for anything. So, essentially professorships maybe. I would’ve been eligible for professorships, but it wasn’t what I wanted to do. I wanted to be a researcher. So, it’s just, everything changed overnight. That was pretty traumatic. So, then I had to pretty much – what we thought at the time was – okay, do we want to move countries again, and just have to kind of start over once again, or do we like it here enough to just stick around and find another job? Which was obviously a huge decision you know. I decided to me an astronomer when I was 8 years old, so did Milly. That’s like 25 years of decision making at that point. Everything is geared toward being an astronomer and remaining in this field. So, to switch away from that was quite a big deal. I lost track of the original question. [laughs]. So, current profession, yeah. So, 2015 when my postdoc was about to expire and then I looked for another job and Data Science was kind of, the obvious switch coz a lot of places were hiring at the time, and it was becoming very trendy, and it was basically a job where I could do the data analysis, do the research, which is what I wanted to do in Astronomy, but would kind of, have to give up to be a professor anyway. So, then I worked at another company as a Data Scientist. \n",

      "H:\tYeah, there was a fair bit. The way it works in Astronomy – you get – there are so few jobs. I mean, the whole global community of Astronomers is about 5000 people. That’s it. We kind of all know each other. So, when you apply for jobs, it’s very unlikely that you get more than one offer, if you get any. So, you keep looking until you get an offer. So, I had yeah, there was an opportunity to stay in the US, go to California. I wasn’t thrilled about the specifics of that role, that Postdoc. And then, the opportunity to come here. And then, also I could’ve just kept looking. When this came about, it just sounded very exciting. So, there was a lot of consideration obviously. But, kind of the appeal of, you know – let’s just go to Australia for 3 years – great, let’s just do that. That really shortened the consideration time because we thought it would be a fun adventure. I’d never been here but, you know, people seem to have fun here, and lot of astronomers were coming here, and they would all just say, oh, you know, it’s a wonderful place. It seems like a good place to be. So, that kind of, shortened the decision time. But yes, there was a lot of consideration – the main consideration was, the main kind of rival in that thing was, trying to figure out something in Canada because we have a lot of colleagues there, and Canada was – the stuff that we starting going through after we got here – Canada has starting going through then. So, they had started restricting fellowships to citizens and things like that. So, we were very close to getting jobs in Victoria in Canada, which was what we really wanted at the time. It was our absolute dream and then the government changed there, and we couldn’t do that. So, with a few doors closing around the world, that also shortened the decision time. There just weren’t that many options. So, once things was, kind of a clear favourite, then we took a few weeks to figure out, really, just the appeal was there, but were just trying to figure out –just the logistics of it all. You know, astronomers are not like, money bag kind of people. It was extremely difficult to go through the process of how much cost and to get here, and make sure, that there’s a bank account, and there’s money somewhere – it was a big freak out. Very very difficult situation. So, it was big decision. We took all the time we had until the observatory wanted an answer. \n",

      "H:\tRight. What were told at the time, was that this was the only option. That wasn’t true. That was not the fact. Every time I’ve asked a question of people who are supposed to know what they are talking about, I get the wrong answer, and I make, I’ve made this mistake many times over the 7 years we’ve lived here. I trust somebody, some expert to tell me what to do, and I find out a year later that it was a terrible decision. It was completely wrong, and everything is just the worst-case scenario. I found out pretty much the day I landed here from one of my colleagues at ANU that – umm – this is a very high up person. He has a direct line to immigration case worker, whatever it’s called. When he wants to bring in somebody from abroad, he picks up the phone and gets that one person on the phone and says, I have a Postdoc, this is a brilliant person, and I need PR. That’s how it worked. Apparently. Yeah. That’s not supposed to happen. But that’s the story I was told. Yeah so, getting people on PR was possible but to me it was presented as absolutely, the only option you have is the 457 visa and then bla bla bla bla. So, Postdocs there were her for – I don’t know how that worked because on paper, that shouldn’t because there’s not ongoing employment. Postdocs are usually fixed term appointment. So, I don’t know how they did that. But yeah, bunch of people went to the ANU on PR directly. \n",

When we decided that – obviously my whole family are back in Europe. So, there’s nobody in this hemisphere even. So, that was definitely a consideration. So, in the beginning it was – oh this is only for 3 years and then ah we’ll see, we’ll probably go back to Europe because that’s a sensible thing to do. It hasn’t gone that way but at the time, I didn’t think so much about my family back home because I thought this was just a short-term thing and we’ll just get to experience it and probably move somewhere else close to home. Not to Greece. It was never a consideration, just realistically, it was never like that. But, yeah, it wasn’t, so I guess it was definitely part of the consideration. But, I guess, it was sort of, that’s okay because it was just a short-ish period. \n",

So, her whole year, everybody who did their PhD at Oxford in her year were here when we moved here. Everybody her year, everybody the year above, everybody the year below. So many of those people were here doing Postdocs. So, yeah, my wife’s friend circle were already here. I can’t remember if we knew that or if that just happened at the same time. I can’t remember if everybody just moved at the same time as we did. I can’t remember if that was already known when we decided to move here. I think we knew that 1 or 2 people were here. Not like, 10 people. So, that was very lucky. That was the main kind of, social group in the first couple of years that we were here. All Postdocs – and then one or two people who moved here later had been Postdocs and then they moved into different jobs. They’ve all gone now. Mostly, they’ve all gone back to wherever, mostly back to the UK coz everything changed with the funding. \n",

      "H:\tSo, were in the US and we apply for a 457. This is February 2012. Then were granted this visa in April of 2012. Then, we’re here. We are scientists and I was granted a 2-year visa even though I had a 5-year contract or something like that. Everybody else got 5 years on their visa. So, same job title, same lab, same everything, except for the nationality, and I got 2 years on my visa, and the Americans got 5 years on their visa. [assessment levels] They told me that’s not what happened. That’s very good to know. That’s very interesting. Then 2-year visa. Then we had to renew. So, we renewed in May or April of 2014. Then, one year later, I moved to Data Science. And then I had to transfer the 457 across to my employer at the time. Then, a year later, probably a year later? Maybe a little bit less, we applied for PR as, what was the path, I can’t remember what it was called – something like direct entry on employer sponsorship and all that stuff. This must have been the direct entry stream or something. 187, maybe. Then we applied for 187 I think at Envizi. This was not the 2-year thing [being working for 2 years at an employer to be eligible for PR]. This was, I had to do the Vetassess. So, I did the skills assessment, and it was granted in 3 days and everyone was confused how it happened. Nobody knew why. Everything else was so difficult and Vetassess was just a matter of days. Oh no, I was thinking of another thing. But it was days. So, the lawyers were like, I guess you got lucky. So, the 457 renewal here was actually 2 days. So, let’s see, ah, this was also so much money bags because it went from like, $300 to $2000. This was out of pocket because this was for a government department. They were explicitly not allowed to pay for someone’s immigration expenses. They covered their side but then your visa expenses, they weren’t allowed to cover. When we came here the visa application was $300 and when we did the renewal, it had changed to $2000. I remember that clearly because $2000 to a Postdoc is an insane amount of money. Then, I got a job offer from here. So, we were waiting for our 6 months, for the PR, and I had to withdraw it because Atlassian said no, we’re not waiting for that. We’ll get you a new visa coz we don’t know how long its gonna take. It was already 6 months that we were waiting, so it might have been a matter of days. We were on a bridging visa but the 457 was still going at the time but I suppose it wasn’t transferable anymore. Yeah, so then, drop 187 application. When was that? I started here in October 16. So, this would’ve been let’s say September. So, we withdraw this application, and then October, new 457 visa. Then we get to November of 18 and we applied for PR for whatever the pathway is – the sponsored. So, that’s the present. We’re just waiting. We’ve been waiting for what – 8 months. \n",

It was at the time, it seemed like a very reasonable thing to do because the pay rise was more than considerable. In fact, the way things have turned out with the stock price, the pay rise was 100% - I’ve doubled my salary. So, it was a good decision. So, that was the consideration at the time – it was good money. But it was also about quality of work and all that. That hasn’t really changed. The work that I do here and the work that I did at Envizi – it was pretty much, you know, there are good days and there are bad days. There isn’t much difference in work for Data Science. So, that was the main driver at the time because I didn’t know how the financial side of it was go because, in terms of base pay, it was very small difference. But the stock price makes a huge difference. The main thing was also this place the work is going to be a whole other level. That hasn’t paid off, but the actual pay has paid off. \n",

      "H:\tSo, let’s see. Last time I made a little mental value of how much this has cost us over the years, it was about $20,000 that we had spent already on immigration. And this doesn’t count the money that the lawyers here are gonna charge – I think that’s gonna be like 5-6k as well for the lawyers here. And, I also haven’t tallied the cost of a bunch of translations and things I needed to do. So up until essentially, up until we changed to the commercial sector, we didn’t really use, essentially any services, we did everything ourselves because of course, Postdoc pay. Up until this point I don’t even think I had to translate anything. So, one side of it is that it was very favourable conditions in academia because essentially, the university vouches for you. Back then, the university was allowed to say, look this person has written academic papers, they can speak English, no language tests, Bye, and they were given that think. Whereas, I don’t think they can do that anymore. In the commercial sector they don’t. It was either when I transferred my visa or when I applied, ah yes, so when I applied for the 187, I had to get language tests, that was IELTS, which was basically a scam as far as I can tell. There’s just one provider, and they just make up a grade that doesn’t give you the top tier English. I’ve taken the test 3 times and I’ve had different grades each time. I’ve asked for remarks and they say, oh, I don’t know, this is your mark. IELTS also cost probably $2000 or something. I took the test 3 times and it expired I guess, and then I had to get a remark because they gave me a ridiculous mark and said my reading comprehension wasn’t good. And, there were mistakes in the questions. I was reading the test and there was a 2-part question and they said, basically, the structure of the question was assertion – based on this assertion tell me this. The assertion was incorrect. You read the question and the assertion is incorrect. They say “these researchers are performing investigations on these things”. No, other researcher in you article are doing this investigation. How do I answer this question? It’s gonna be wrong. It’s a scam. I have very strong opinions about this. I mean, I spoke to so many people while we were waiting. And it’s not only that. I mean, it’s a scam, there’s only one provider, obviously there’s politicians getting bribes here. Like, I come from a country where people tell you there’s a bribe. Here, they don’t tell you. But, it’s a bribe. There’s only one provider. But they were testing people – I was chatting to a guy from South Africa who obviously grew up speaking English. He was an Anglo-South African and he needed the test to do a PhD. To start a PhD program. Oh, don’t get me started on IELTS. Many emotions there. They’re also so rude. All the staff were horrifically rude. I mean, you can’t take a water bottle in there. You can’t go to the bathroom for 5 hours. I mean who do these people think they are? It feels as though, all the times I was randomly detained in the US, they put you in a little room with a small TV with Fox news playing, and there’s no remote, and it’s on high you try to just reach the off button. That’s the feeling I got in the IELTS room. It’s quite detention-y. You feel like a criminal. So, okay, up until, the whole academic time, no commercial services used. We do everything ourselves. When they transferred the 457 visa, here there’s a migration agent but the company paid for that. So, this is Envizi. Then, with the VETASSESS, again, there’s a migration agent, and then I and to pay for VETASSESS myself. I had to take the IELTS test, which also the agent didn’t realise I had to do until literally a week before the deadline which was stressful. Actually, at this point Physicist was on the list but the migration agent told me it wasn’t an option. So, I asked, can I do a self-sponsored thing? He said, normally you would but you don’t have a profession that doesn’t allow you to do that. That was incorrect completely. I mean, I would’ve had a PR years ago – 4 years ago and then, at the same time my actual profession at the time, which was an Analyst, I wasn’t actually, on paper, I wasn’t qualified as an Analyst for the points system. So, I couldn’t apply under some archaic title – operations analyst or something from the 80’s. That would be the profession but for that you need a degree in that, which doesn’t exist by the way. Or, you would need something like 2 years of practice in that field but at that time my whatever, 10 or 12 years of Physics didn’t count because I wasn’t an Analyst on paper. So, I was eligible for this direct entry, 187 thing, whatever it was. That was the only thing at the time. They made it impossible for me to apply as a skilled worker independently as an Analyst even when I had 2 years because they changed the rules. So, at that point, this is where the big money comes in. There’s also a lot of money for translations here. Not education – that was all in English. But, birth certificate, things like that. And of course, the agent is paid. Police checks, yeah, of course from each country. Thank God I didn’t need one from Chile, because technically I didn’t live there. I wasn’t there, I didn’t have a visa there. I was just visiting there for my research and I had a time limit – like, I wasn’t there for a year. But, my wife was, which is a bundle of joy now, a current blocker for our PR. They are asking for documents that they know cannot be obtained. Police checks from Chile. When my wife lived there – we actually met there – she was a diplomat, on a diplomatic visa. Scientists in the government agency where she was working there get a diplomatic visa, the car, and the house, the whole shabang. What that means is 2 things. There is no trace of you in police records. They don’t allow to have a trace because you’re a diplomat unless you’ve done some serious crimes, I guess. I don’t know what kind of treaties are in place for that. But, yeah, and then. But, when you leave the country, you have to relinquish your ID – your super-duper special ID that you can flash to people to get out of parking violations I guess, I don’t know why people use that. So on one hand you don’t have police records, on the other you almost didn’t exist there apart from your employers assertion that this person was a diplomat here. So, now they know – like, theyre asking for a photocopy of her ID card – the special ID card. They know that we can’t get that. I don’t know what’s gonna happen but this is the current stage that we’re in. We have a letter from her employer, signed, like, everything, with like the official seal. This is an international treaty organisation that’s putting a stamp on a piece of paper. That already was difficult to get. No, not enough. They wanted to get every bit of communication to prove that we’ve tried to do this. They wanted every bit of written communication between us and the people who tried to help us out in Chile with a statutory declaration and everything. Actually, they didn’t ask for that. Our lawyer said, do that and it will probably work, and they’ve been sitting with that for 3 months now. They’ve asked for it twice. You provided this but you didn’t provide this. I was like, umm, you didn’t read the thing we provided. That’s very reassuring. So, we’ve essentially the same documents twice because they asked for it twice. So, anyway, now all of these intermediate things are peppered with these delightful experiences of going to the lawyers. They’re very good – the lawyers that we use here – thankfully. Unlike the migration agent at the previous place. So, I’ve got to the lawyers several times with a stack of papers that have costed thousands of dollars to precure, dropping them on the desk, and they go, literally this morning everything changed, or literally, 3 days ago everything changed. So, I’m beginning to slowly slip into conspiratorial thinking because they know its gonna take about 6 months to get your documents. Even if you move at the fastest possible pace, that’s how long it takes to get a document from another country. So, they change everything every 6 months. At some point - I didn’t actually finish this project – I started writing an algorithm coz they do have to by law, post everything on their website right? So, I would parse through all those documents and see how much stuff changed and how frequently it changes. I should have finished that project. I never did. I got too frustrated with the whole process. So yeah, it changes basically frequently enough that you just have no chance of getting the document together. That’s our experience with PR here in the last one year.  So, what else have we paid for? Medical tests. Terrible health insurance. I had to go to the hospital a few months ago. I had a kidney stone, and I had to go to the hospital. This is the only one option that we have for health insurance with the 457 visa. They won’t even pay for the hospital. What do you think, I got kidney stones for fun? The most recent message is like, oh you should claim that on Medicare. You don’t understand what you do, do you? I’m sure they’re other things – oh notarizing documents also. Also, that’s more or less the things that cost money. Those processes had to be done multiple times. I’ve got like 5 FBI checks because it takes them so long to process things, I need to go get another one just in case. I’ve got probably 4 UK police checks. I’ve got like, a dozen AFP police checks. Thankfully, the FBI changed their system and you can do it online now. But it used to be, you had to go, get your fingerprints done, actually no, that’s still the case. The police officer has to take your fingerprints at the precinct, and they have to send the envelope out. So, they have to do all these logistics. So it could take anywhere between 6 and 9 months to actually issue the certificate. So in 4 months, we would reapply because we thought that by the time the case worker got to the case, we would go over the year and need a new one. So, go to the police station, get the police check done, then the FBI sends a piece of paper through Auspost that probably gets lost, and they say, oh your pinky is not visible. Send a new one. Like this, is 1890 or something. But thankfully they changed this in the last 6 months and the only complicated part is the finger printing. \n",

      "H:\tSo, I’ve never been surrounded by mostly Australians the whole time I’ve live here. The very few good scientists, or scientists that Australia produces go abroad mostly. The majority of Scientists that are trained here don’t work here. So, the import is how they make up for that shortfall. So, at the observatory, there was my boss and one colleague and that’s it. That’s all the Australian’s. Apart from that, everyone else, all the other postdocs, apart from that one guy, were from all over the place. Then when I moved to Envizi, I think there were only 2 Australians among 25 other people there. I mean, Australian born Australians. No, Actually, the 2 people Im thinking about came here as children. I don’t think anyone was born here in Australia. So, very international. So, technology sector, it was very international. Now, were beginning to produce the talent here, beginning. Here, is the same. We have junior developers who are Australians and some junior designers, I guess but mostly everybody is from abroad. All the analysts I work with, there’s quite a few people in the Analytics department, umm, were from all over the place. And then, somehow, even the things that we did as pastime hobbies, whatever, we were part of a couple of Karate, martial arts communities, and even those communities were all immigrants. The community on Deewhy where there were 3 Australian and everybody else were imports like us including the instructors. The people that started the community are from South Africa. We are actually really good friends. The one that we go to now, they are from Peru. So, somehow, not because we sought out immigrant communities, but the majority of people around us are immigrants. At most, they the children of immigrants. I don’t know that I know any Australians who are not the children of immigrants. Apart from a couple of people in – when you live on the North Shore – that’s the only place where weve met people who’s parents were born – in fact, No, nobody’s parents were born in Australia. I don’t know anybody who’s parents were born here. I don’t think I’ve met anybody. And I never tried for that to happen. I mean obviously we seek out things but not at work, not when you’re at a Karate class. This is gonna sound really mean and kind of, this is not gonna sound very good. But I don’t -  I can’t think of many fundamentally Australian activities that I wanna be a part of. Like, what am I gonna do? I don’t gamble, I don’t surf, I don’t drink heavily, like, what am I gonna do. Like, those are fundamentally Australian, Australian things. Like, I don’t do these things. So, the things that I do are – and I know how pretentious and snobbish this is gonna sound – but yea, all of the things that I do, their foundation, their roots are in, essentially, old world culture. Is this thing a painting? – Im interested. Does this thing involve music? – Im interested. But those are not things that originate here. Those are not the things that people do here. And I know how snobbish that sounds, and I don’t mean it to be this way. I’m not a snob about Australia. Australia is a great place. I’m just not interested in those things. It’s like golf. I know difficult. I know, it’s kind of amazing. I just don’t care. I don’t care if golf is difficult. I still don’t find it interesting or important. So, the past few experiences have been handled by lawyers, so I haven’t done much of that. The first time, my wife, the saint that she is, she took care of that. She was like, you know, you got the job, the paperwork – I’ll take care of that which is also a very nice thing. Also, I freak out about paperwork. She’s much better at that. So, yeah, so mili did that. The first time, it didn’t feel that daunting. The second time when we were renewing our visa at the observatory, I think it was significantly more complicated. I seem to remember that. And then the lawyers took care of it. So, all I had to do is fill out their form, and then they went and adapted that into the official form. Anytime I had to look up something for that, it was like reading Sanskrit. It was just, I had no idea what’s going on. So, I definitely relied on the lawyers. The thing is that I relied on migration agents too much and I thought that Im not gonna ask everybody how they did these things because im not gonna bother them because we have this expert. Ofcourse, when I brought things up with people because they would ask, hey how’s it going with PR, did you get it? So, after we applied for this 187, and spent all this money, I remember having a drink with this friend of mine and he asked a question and I was like you know, Physicist is not on the list and we had to do all this other stuff. He says what are you talking about. Physicist is absolutely on the list and he just goes on his phone and goes here it is – it’s on the list. I was just gonna jump of the roof coz it was so expensive and so complicated and it handcuffed me to my employer which I didnt like. I was very happy there at the time but I did not like the idea at all of being tied to an employer because – this is not what happened, everybody was really nice – but as soon as they know that you’re handcuffed there, they can do whatever they like, and what are you gonna do, leave? It is the same situation here but there was no other option for me. This is the only way we could apply for PR. There was absolutely no other choice. We were gonna apply again, this time last year, July last year is when I had all the requisites and points and all the requirements, and that’s when they took the operations analyst, the something something off the list. So, I didn’t qualify. Now they, I think they said, that they would bring in this tech worker category, but I don’t think they did that, and I would absolutely qualify under that if they were no bring it in. And also, actually, one other thing changed in the meantime. So my wife also changed from Astronomy around the same time as I did. Actually no, about a year later, and she wanted to do technical writing. They changed her profession and bumped it down to the short-term list. So, we couldn’t apply through her, and she’s an American citizen so we would’ve gotten much better treatment. But, she’s no longer eligible for PR because technical writer was bumped down to the 2-year list. \n",

Oh, actually, this reminds me, we did use another migration agent at some point because I completely lost trust in migration agent in my previous company. So, we actually did pay a bunch of money to another migration agent to confirm what this person was doing because we lost trust completely. And this was through a network, our freiemds who are also immigrants told us this person, she knows everything. That was very good. We were seeking advice about a few things, very confidentially – we were asking if we apply through an employer and leave the day the PR happens, what’s the worst-case scenario? Do we get our PR taken away, do we get deported, what’s gonna happen? So, we were seeking an answer to that question. And again, nobody has the answer to that really.

So, I was prodding them to do that because then they can come here on a work and holiday visa. So, my little brother is about to do that. Im sure he’ll come alomg for the adventure. Ive never felt qualified to provide advice. I’ve kind of pointed people toward and away from migration agents and that kind of thing.

      "H:\tWe are thinking about it now. Again, obviously this is very very confidential. We are planning on NZ at some point. NZ is what we thought Australia is, I think, for a number of reasons. Plenty of disillusionment but that’s not really a reason. That would be a silly reason to move. Really, its just how expensive it is here. We don’t really, even though we are very, very well paid here. I’m pinching myself everyday with my Science background about this but its still not enough to buy a house, to have the kind of life we want. We’re not Australian, we don’t have family here. Its not like were gionna move to another city in Australia. That’s not meaningful to us. We could move to Adelaide but why move to Adelaide. That’s one extra flight to go home. Why would I do that? NZ, Wellington specifically is the right size of town for us. It’s the perfect compromise because I grew up in the country side so I would live in the woods if I could. Mili grew up in New York so it’s a litte different but shes getting tired of big cities too. So, small cities is kind of a perfect compromise. Its culture – one of the things that really – uhh – I cant – I, how, I mean we go to the Art Gallery in NSW every time we have a visitor and – this has happened like 2 or 3 times – I walk into the Art Gallery of NSW and I say to my visitor, I need to run to the bathroom but what you need to do is go down the stairs and to the right and at the far end of the gallery take another right, that’s the gallery you wanna go see coz theres one gallery basically, in Sydney and I know it like the back of my hand. I don’t like it. I wanna go to a gallery and see different things. That’s a very old world sort of view of the world should be about. It is not Australia’s view and I don’t begrudge it. Australia has many other things that are amazing but not for me. Theyre not amazing to me. They still don’t make up for the shortfall of traditional culture, the things I want. It’s a much friendlier place as well. Our decision was reinforced by a million times after the horrible thing that happened in Christchurch and the response that they had there. Ive never seen a people, a society react so well to something so bad. I mean, the US went on a wold wide killing spree after 9-11. These guys have the worst crime that’s ever been committed there and somehow everyones wants to move there after the response. We were actually there at the time after that happened, and we get there, and it’s a really grave atmosphere. But, people are going about their business. We were in Wellington, not in Christchurch. We were talking to everybody and everybody’s having conversations about it and saying you know, how oh you know, im gonna send a little book to the mosque tomorrow. We were in tears the whole time we were there because it was the most beautiful human reaction to something bad that had happened. It was extraordinary. That really reinforced this desire to move that. And it’s a place we can afford a house.  People in politics get in the way of things here all the time. Its not a progressive country which is fine. I don’t have to live in the most progressive place. That’s ok. But when it becomes, like, refugees are in concentration camps, and we refuse to put solar panels in our eternally sunny country because our friends in coal won’t make enough money – that’s pretty much the 2 most significant things in my world right now. You know, basically destroying the, like, it’s like a proper existential threat to humanity and this country is doing the exactly the opposite of what it should be doing, and I just dont wanna be here because of that. I know that leaving is not the answer. Staying here and having the opportunity to vote – in however many years they let me do that – would be a way to combat that. The climate change stuff, Im not gonna be waiting for 4 years to become a citizen to combat that. Im gonna go to a place where I can contribute to that sector, and they have a huge renewable sector in NZ. In fact, they run most of the renewables from Australia – wind farms, hydro, and solar – most of the actual commercial capacity is run by Australian companies. So, I could actually go an contribute there instead of being a drag here because every time I put the heater on, I’m screwing up the environment. Im not gonna freeze in the cold either. Yeah, its politics that is driving us away. It also, I felt this on a personal level whe I first got here – how can these people vote for One Nation? People we know, people in Karate, were like oh well not you, like all the other riff-rafs. It was infuriating. I just wanted to punch the wall, and I did sometimes. It was exasperating and I took that on a personal level. I don’t anymore. But now I see it as a big societal issue. This really is a thing. People don’t feel so strongly about there being horrific racists in their family. They’re like, whatever, Ah, uncle Tim’s a racist, some people are racists, ah, its fine. Or I’m not really a racist, I just want sensible immigrants to come here. Get out of here!\n",

In principle its one year. In practice it won’t. Coz you have to have 12 months of presence in the country before you’re eligible to apply. Then it can be months. Sometimes they say ah yeah sure, and then it can be months or years until your citizenship ceremony, which is when you actually become a citizen. So, it could be 3 years.

So, that’s why – in my case I practised yoga for 15 years. I’m actually a Yoga teacher in Argentina. I came here just to improve my English and of course study a little bit more, certify my level of Yoga with an international recognized certification. I met him last here, not here in Melbourne – in Sydney. A long-distance relationship and it was like a job, building this relationship because every day…messages, skype… Fortunately, technology today is like, on your side, when this type of situations happens, you know. Fortunately, both of us, he and me, we have certain economical resources. So, for example he could go to… he went to Argentina last year, he stay with me for 2 months. So, he had the opportunity to meet my environment - My house, my car, my family, my friends, my everything. So, after that we decided to go on and well… to come here.\n",

I never in my life considered Australia like a possibility. Never. Because I don’t.. I prefer.. I love France. It is the truth. I am totally in love with France. I have been there like more than 10 times and I always visualise myself living in Europe, maybe France. I talk a little bit the language... not so good but, yes I have taken the examination and it’s a medium and average level of French. But well, the love appeared in my life and I never ever thought that he will be here in Australia and I decided last year to come here in Australia only once because I wanted to brush up my English a little bit after going so many years into France. So, I say well, I will come to Australia because there’s nice weather, we are in the same, parallel with Argentina so we share the same seasons, and I say well, the only time I will come here will be this – 2019 and well the love appeared in my life. I didn’t expect it. I visited Paris always, always like a tourist. But, it is not so… Like its strict here in Australia. I can get into Europe maybe sometimes twice a year. I used to go always under a tourist visa so I can stay in the country maybe 1 month. Next time, 1 month and a half. So, I can go, coming, go, get in, get out of the country.\n",

Well, when I started to gather all the paperworks that the government ask from me, and I thought it was overwhelming. Overwhelming!

At the same time, I was working, and I have two jobs… of course everything I need to do to support my life and fortunately, the man I had in my life was very supportive.

My English was so behind that one year I tried to do my best. I have proved it with a grade of 6 which is enough to come here. But the IELTS is not only the cost of the examination, you have the fee but also private classes. Those private classes started in March, middle of March 2018. I can’t remember the exact date, but it was middle of March 2018. And I did that because I wanted to improve my communication skills. So, after that the immigration agent. He charged me the same fee to apply for the visa here. I can’t remember numbers, but I think it’s more or less between $600-700. So, he charged me that. Plus, I can’t remember exactly but it was about the same to apply visa. And then I had to attest documents. For instance, my degree, letters of recommendation from my 2 jobs, financial situation – I needed to prove that I have enough money to support my living here for 1 year, other things – I need to pay the fee so I paid $10,000 – that’s the cost of the year. I paid altogether, you know why – because I wanted to… just to get rid of it because the rest of the money, I know its just for me. I don’t have to worry. And, they asked me for statutory declaration from 3 people from my community from Argentina. For instance, I play tennis, so I asked one person, someone who plays tennis with me, someone who belongs to the same class… For instance, you go the police. Its like, that you declare under God that I know that person, he’s a very good person, he’s a part of the community. So, everything of that, translated. Yes, and what else.

Maybe because in Argentina we are more welcoming with people and if Aussie…Australian people want to go, we won’t make it hard for them. So, here I need to prove that I have $30000. It was very hard to gather all this money, but I did it. I had to prove a lot of things. They wanted me to prove that I had things in Argentina just to bring me back after the visa, you know and I did it because I have a lot of things to go back to in Argentina. I have my family, my friends. Here I am alone and the only person I have is my partner. But, I bet for this. It’s a bet. And I only need one year for this. In one year we can make the decision – if we get married or if it is over. But, it’s like the government is pushing you, you lie, not lie but you look at different options. For instance, paying a course here just to get a student visa and on the other side I don’t want to get married straight away.

I think he wanted to take advantage me because he proposed me after that if I wanted to go and get some experience with him and work for nothing, not being paid, I can go to his shop. So, work and not be paid. This is one option. And the second option he gave to me was well I have another… he had another company for cleaners and that’s something I don’t want to do. I don’t clean my house. I don’t want to go and clean someone else’s house. Really! I want something I appreciate, and I respect a lot people who do that. Of course, I respect them.

It is life. It is not fair. And if you get angry, you will lose. You say okay, thank you, I will think about it. Bye-bye. I finish with one list if things. I gathered all the documentation. It was like a mountain – mountain of things. And I say I can relax and I started to feel in my body that sensation of relax. Another list came to my email with new things. You know, really, I forgot about them. But for instance, let’s say, the statutory declaration from my community. That’s something new so I need to look for friends, waiting for them to be available, go to the police. It was really, really hard for me and everything then translated. Well, one moment was that. Everything translated in English. Well it is, I have to say, there is a logic. Its logical but I have no more money because I need to keep my living in my country. I save money because the government of Australia wanted me to prove that I have to support my living here and also paying all of that. I said I can’t, I can’t. My partner, he helped me.

You only need to walk, and you are in the middle of a museum. People have such good manners. Here? no!. People in France they have good manners when they eat. They are delicate. They are like stylish. Here it’s like, everything is like, gross. I’m being a horrible person if I say that. Sorry but well, it’s that. But, I really like very much this person that I found. I came here because of him. I’m just giving an opportunity to this country to fall in love with this country too. I want to. But, sometimes you want but you don’t decide. I’m trying to. He cant move. First thing because he can’t speak Spanish and he’s not willing to learn Spanish. I speak English. Maybe I’m not a C1, C2, but my English is perfect to help me to build our relationship – its enough. He has 2 kids. One of his kids, he’s disabled  - yes neurological, physiological, physical. It’s a boy. He’s only 7 years old and doctors say his expectation of life is not too long, you know. The other girl – the girl is good. No problem with her. They don’t live with us but every fortnight they come. Next week, for instance, it’s the girls birthday so we are going to celebrate. Well, instead of that I decided to come here. It’s a challenge. So, I would really like to understand why people are so in love with this country. I’m only in love with him. Well, something that I started to realise about Australia, and I love is for instance, so efficient, with the financial system. I went to the commonwealth bank and it was so easy to open an account. It was 10 minutes. I couldn’t believe it. In Argentina everything is a problem. That’s something that I really like. Now I manage all my money and all my payments through the application and it is amazing. It is easy. I’m so relaxed with that. I try to discover things in the landscape. For example, I went to this exhibition about the revolutionaries in the Melbourne museum. It was amazing and I pushed my partner to come with me because it’s like, maybe I’m wrong, but I think that sometimes maybe Australian people are not interested in culture or maybe, learning new things. They only want to wake up, go to work, come back, eat, go back to work. The routine is too strict. But, in the middle of all this there is culture.

I kept my job at the university. I have a license there. So, it is 2 years. It is a university for Engineers. So, the subject that I am running there, it is like a cultural subject for future Engineers. So, for instance I have courses in civil Engineering, Mechanical and so on, like something general and they considered me for license. So university - I love it. But the other one, they said no, if you leave, you quit. That was something very hard I need to do. Like, I told you before, to bet for this person, really, look, it’s amazing how things work. I didn’t expect and really, I like him. Yes, I love him. But loving someone is not enough but also how you work together. You can love a charming prince but then the charming prince is like an idiot so you can’t keep that image. But here it’s a person that I love and I like. So, I did a lot of hard things just to give this relationship an opportunity. So, quit very important and stable job in Argentina related with my profession. The only perspective in this job was like, growing. And here, look, I have no problems. If I need to go to work in a coffee shop, I have no problems with that. I don’t like cleaning. I don’t like that. But making coffee, maybe working in a shop – I have no problem with that. Of course, its not something recognized, and qualified like I have in Argentina but its okay.M:\tWhen did you first migrate to Australia?\n",

      "L:\tI came to Australia first in 2001, on a working holiday visa, a backpacking visa, and absolutely loved it. I had some family in Brisbane. So, it was almost like a rite of passage for my cousins – we all came here, and absolutely loved it, and always wanted to come back. And then, kind of, life gets in the way. I got married, I got 3 kids, and had work and it just so happened, I had a really bad day at work and saw a job advertised here. I though oh, that’s quite exciting. Shall I apply, and my husband said, oh just apply. What have you got to lose – not thinking I would actually get the post. But, I got it and ended up coming back here. He’d also done backpacking here – he’d been over on a year visa. Not at the same time as be, but yeah. So, he knew what he was coming into as well. So, I flew into Sydney when I arrived the first time and didn’t like it. It felt like, it was a city that could’ve been anywhere in the world. It didn’t really feel like Australia to me at that time, and I had two weeks here, then before I went on travelling around in Australia. But then, when I came back home, I had another 2 weeks in Sydney, and I actually loved it. It was just that I had been around, and kind of knew what to expect. I don’t know what my expectations were when I first arrived. But, I don’t know what I was expecting actually. The city didn’t provide that the first time. But when I came back, it did. \n",

But I guess, it was my first time travelling, first time away from home, didn’t really know anybody, didn’t know what I was supposed to be doing. So, I went backpacking by myself. So it was me in a new city, and.. but I think by the time I came back around, I had a better idea of Australia. I had a better idea of myself I think. I had to go back and finish my undergraduate. So, I was only here for a year. In fact, it just just short of a year and I knew I had to go back and finish my degree. So, wasn’t an option to stay, and at that time it was only a 1-year visa. They didn’t have this 2-year option that they have now, and it was that whole thing to having to have money in the bank to show that you have funds to travel – so I think, I had to have, like a 1000 pounds in the bank before I could get my visa to come back, and then I didn’t have any as a student. I didn’t have any money. So, my mum and dad put money in my account so I could show them, to get my visa. It was a good experience.\n",

      "L:\tSo, we – So, I’ve always talked about coming back, and coming over with the kids, and in 2012, 2011 actually – we came across for a month. We went to Perth in Western Australia, for a month over Christmas for a holiday. That’s was when I thought, okay we have a bit of money – lets have a good holiday. And, at the back of my mind, I was like, lets have a holiday, lets just see if we could do this. Could we stay here. We had a great month, and then we came home and my father-in-law died. So, my mother-in-law was by herself, and my husband said, theres no way we can even think about going away, now that shes by herself. So, that kind of went on the backburner. I think it had always been at the back of my mind. My husband was sort of forced into it this time – coerced into it. I think there was always a plan, not sure if I’d actually realise it though. Didn’t think it would actually happen. Coz as my kids get bigger, there’s the thing about school, and so there was a kind of plan, that I didn’t know for sure was gonna happen…if that makes sense? So, my kids are 14, 12, and 9 – 2 in high school and one in primary. So, when we had come over for a holiday, my kids loved it – absolutely had a ball. So, I’d kind of been working on that – last couple of years, like, oh – how good would it be to live in Australia, and they are really outdoorsy. So they all surfed in Scotland. So, they all could imagine surfing in Australia. So, they definitely helped pave the way – I think they were definitely open to the thought of moving elsewhere. My husband was working. He’s a carpenter to trade but he was working in the offshore oil industry. So, he was working away for 3 weeks, home for 3 weeks, and he hated it – absolutely hated it. So, he was looking for an excuse to leave there. So, I think, I used that to my advantage as well. I think that timing worked really well with this post coming up. We had been feeling really unsettled, and maybe a change would be good. And, then my mother in law is now, has a new partner, and she lives half the year in Canada as well. Edmonton, no – my brothers in Edmonton. Shes in London, Ontario. So, that was kinda not an issue anymore either. So, it all kind of feel in place. And also my sons 14 – so it was almost like now or never because he was gonna enter exams at school. So, if we didn’t go kinda soon, then we wouldn’t get to go..\n",

      "L:\tOkay – Im a senior lecturer in design and innovation here. So, Im 40:40:20 contract here so, 2 days research, 2 days teaching, and a day of service. So, I’ve been doing that for the past 4 years. I’ve been in a teching research role with Glasgow school of Art in Scotland. But I’ve kind of.. this is.. kind of … different patchwork of things I would say. So, my undergraduate was in Design, and you cant do very much with a design degree, not at that time anyway. So, I left my undergraduate and went to work as a curator on an Island – so I moved to an Island – a tiny, remote Scottish Island, at the age when all the people, as 21 are leaving the island. So, it was really, a good experience but it was really hard t break into the community coz everybody goes, you know. They grow up on an island and cant wait to leave, and I was joining it. I was there for a couple of years. And then I moved back home and worked in the local government for about 4 or 5 years, in policy. So, I did policy development. And at that time I went back and did my Masters in Policy development and management. It was quite interesting how policy was written, and then got frustrated with local government, and also I had my kids at the same time. So, went free-lance and did some project management for Arts and Cultural projects, and I did that for about 10 years, and then saw a PhD position. It was in cultural policy, and I thought that’s really quite interesting. I’m kind of a really curious person and cant imagine not learning. So, I applied for this PhD position – never got it. So, I was gutted. Then they phoned me a couple of weeks later and said that we’ve got this other PhD, not in cultural policy, but in design innovation – you might be interested? So, I jumped on it. So, I did my PhD as part of a larger design project that involved 5 Art schools, it was a national project and my PhD – So, I was funded for 3 years, and my PhD fund had run out after the 3rd year and I wasn’t finished. So, I had to work full time from there. So, my PhD took 6 years. But I finished, and then for the past 4 years I’ve been working on this digital health project. \n",

      "L:\tIt all happened very quickly. So, I applied for the post in October, and I had a skype interview in, at the end of November. I actually applied for a different post. I never got the different post. So, I had a second interview and they said, no I didn’t get the post, but they have this other post – if you’re interested. I said I might be interested in that. So that was the end of November and they said, well can you come out and look at the campus, come visit us and see if you like it. So, they flew me out in the second week of December to have a look around. So, I spent a week meeting everybody, deciding if it was or wasn’t what I was going to do. That was 8th of December. So, they had offered me the post, given me the contract. I had to accept it by, I think, the 18th of December before everybody broke off for Christmas, so that they can start the visa process. So, that was the 18th or 20th of December. I said yes, okay we’ll definitely take the post, we’ll make the move, subject to the visa of course. The visa came through, so yes – that was Christmas time, the school closed, and I was still getting emails from HR requesting all the information. They sent me a long list of everything they needed. I needed to get the police checks, I needed to have all the birth certificates, all the addresses where you’ve stayed, copies of my qualification, and all that kind of paperwork, and all the kids birth certificates and all because they were gonna sponsor us all to come over – and before Christmas. And, they did their part of the visa application, and I got an email on the 3rd of January from the immigration office just asking me to submit my part of the visa application, and the money – pay my part of it, and the visa came through in a week. So, it was crazy fast. By the time we came back to work after Christmas in January, the 15th of January, we were getting ready to go. Although I hadn’t handed in my notice at that point because I couldn’t hand in my notice if I didn’t know my visa was gonna come through. So I went back to my old job in January and handed in my notice and asked them how long do you want me to work for. I’m meant to have 3 months of a leave time before I hand in my notice, and they said okay fine, if you can finish your teaching then you can go whenever. So, I handed in my notice with a finish date of 23rd of February – was gonna be my last day at work, which was a Friday and then we flew out on Saturday. Must be the 24th. So I only had, really, that kind of 6 weeks from Christmas to when we actually left to fly and everything, sell our house, everything. We only came out suitcases – sold everything. We’ve stolen a room at my parents house for things I couldn’t sell at that time, and things that I wasn’t sure that I want to get rid of you know, that type of thing. But it was quite cathartic – just stuff you accumulate over 20 odd years. \n",

      "L:\tThat was crazy. So, when I came over in December for my visit, I kinda had a couple of days where I thought I’m gonna go have a look at what’s available apartment wise or house wise. I did 2 or 3 viewings and I almost cried. None of the houses were good – they were just awful. The problem was that we left a beautiful house in Scotland. We’d renovated it, and a huge huge house, and I know I wasn’t gonna get something like that here. It’s a city. We came from a rural, coastal village. So, I started to panic. And the university sent me, as part of my welcome pack, and it had, I got some relocation expenses for moving us over for our flights and towards our visa, and also they offered to reimburse an agent, or some kind of help with finding a house. The limit was $10,000 – 10000 or 5000 – It was $15,000 altogether and we could choose to spend that however – like using a relocation agent or a housing agent, or however we wanna use that relocation money. But actually our flights were about $12,000 alone. So, I couldn’t spend on a relocation expert. So, we just had to kind of do it ourselves online which was crazy. Because its so expensive and particularly coming from the UK, where the wages are not nearly the same as what they are here. So, having to find the money that we can put down for a month’s accommodation, and visa cost, and – coz I knew I would have to wait for 2 months to claim it back from the university. So I begged, borrowed and stole from parents and – until we had enough to pay for our first months accommodation. So we ended up booking an Airbnb for the first month in Lilyfield – its towards Rozelle. So, we got an Airbnb there for the first month and it was nice, it was a house, 3 bedrooms, so the little ones were together and my son had a room to himself, and it was close enough to university for me to commute – it was 20 minutes by bus. So, it was actually perfect. It did the job, and then in that time we had to find something permanent. It was really difficult. We – and I think more difficult for my husband coz he had done all the renovation so he didn’t want to live anywhere that wasn’t as good as what we had. So, really not a lot available. We looked eveuywhere. We looked at apartments, and we looked at houses. We looked all over Sydney. And the problem was I didn’t know what suburb we wanted to be based in. I forget what its called but theres a site online where you can check the suburbs and theyre given ratings. Its not Domain – I know that site the back of my hand, Ive been on it, you know, constant. Theres another site – I cant remember if its know your suburb or… you can type in, like you can search all the Australian suburbs and its gonn agive you ratings for family friendly, or convenience, or distance from the city. And we ended up scouting that and finding out which suburbs might fit, and in the end we – that last week of our Airbnb, we still hadn’t found anything. So everyday – and I was working at that time – so it was up to my husband and the kids to go look. So everyday, my husband was looking. Every evening, we were just going to viewing after viewing after viewing. And we wanted to be in the Northern beaches. We wanted to be next to the water, and on the last Wednesday before we were due to leave the Airbnb, we said right – we can’t find anything in the Northern beaches, where else can we go. And somebody here said, well have you looked down in Sutherland shire, coz you know the beaches down there. So, we said okay lets go down and see all the open viewings that day and so we went down to Cronulla, and Caringbah, and we saw one house that was perfect. It was a brand new built, 5 bedrooms – so enough bedrooms for everybody, had a swimming pool, and it was the same price as what we were looking for apartments in the city. So, I was just like, this is just amazing. We took it on the spot. So we took it for a 2 year lease. So, there’s another – as part of our searching, I had set a radius from the university of an hour’s public transport, just basically drew a circle. I just wanted it to be an hour maximum. So, I am pretty much just an hour door to door. 40-minute train ride and 10 minutes walk each side. \n",

So, my brother is in Canada, my sisters in West Africa, Im in Australia, and just one brother at home with my parents. My mum and dad – I was the first one to have kids, so they’re really close to my children. When I was doing my PhD, I had to travel 2 hours to university. So, my mum used to come down at 5 in the morning to let me go for the 6 o’clock train, and she would leave the kids to school, then go to her work and come to mine after work, and give them their tea, and put them to bed, and get home at like 10 o’clock at night. So, she had a lot to do with my kids. They find it really difficult. But, they’re also supportive. They’re happy to – and I had told them that I had applied this job in Australia. They were just like – oh what has she got on her head this time. And then when I got it, my mum was excited, but my dad was very quiet. My dad is never quiet. But it’s been fine. They’re coming out in October so that’s really good. It was also difficult.. so, I come from a huge, massive family. My dad’s one of 11 children, and my great granny is still alive. She’s 97. So, 11 kids and then there’s 38 grand-children that are my generation, and 36 great grandchildren – the generation before, and we’re all over the world. Theres some in Australia, some in Singapore, some in America and Canada. So, she was really happy for us. She was really really just so excited. My other grandmum, so my mums mum – Shes gonna be 90 this year. She’s had a lot to do with my kids as well. So they used to go to hers for tea couple of nights a week, and going to see her after school. But she found it really difficult when we told her. I think that I find that the most difficult part. My mum and dad are fine – they’re busy, they’re working, they’ve got a social life. But my granny – she doesn’t leave the house. So us going, I think she’s really going to miss the kids, and my son particularly, hes 14, and he you know, did a lot of baking with her, and you know, had a really close relationship. So, that was hard telling her. But everybody else, I think, was quite happy. It’s a close knit community there – so I think its about 700 houses. 2000 people. So everybody knows everybody, and I have a really close group of about 10 girlfriends, and all the kids are the same age, and it was hard telling them coz all the kids have grown up together, we’ve grown up together in a way I guess. But everybody was really positive. There was a few comments of you know, why are you going to the other side of the world? Why! Why!. Laughs. \n",

So, I asked him for advice. But he’s a bit older than me, not married, and doesn’t have kids. So, he has a kind of, different perspective of Sydney than – So he was helpful because he provided an address that I could send my bank cards and things to, coz I was worried about things going to the Airbnb, and we’d already moved on. So, he could provide a permanent address that I could send important documents to. Apart from that, not really. I kinda just had to scour the internet for advice and all that. Some of the people I met here were really helpful. I got some emails as I was preparing, saying, you know, if there’s any questions, just let me know. Particularly, once they found out I had kids. Lots of people suggested things about school’s coz that was another problem right – where do we go to school. What’s a good school, do we move to a particular area to find a good school? They’re quire strict with the zoning, and the school systems are quite different. You’ve got your private schools, and you’ve got your selective schools, which weren’t open to us on our visa, so it was gonna be public schools. On our visa, my kids can’t get entry to selective school. We could pay for private school, or the public system. With 3 kids I can’t afford to pay for private schools, and my husband isn’t working yet. So, I’m the only one earning – so there’s no way. But, actually, we visited a couple of schools in the area – around the house, and we basically just ended up picking one. \n",

      "L:\tIt is interesting. So when we were first coming out around, 2012, my husband would be the nominated skilled person that time coz I was in the middle of my PhD, and hes a carpenter. So, he would’ve had to do a skills test, and he refused to do a skills test. He said, I’ve been a carpenter for 20 odd years. Why would I need to go and show someone I can hammer a nail to prove myself – and he had to pay for that test as well. He was like, Im not gonna do that. So, that was a little block for us then. This time around, it was interesting because it isn’t called a skilled visa but they didn’t – apart from my qualifications, and a letter from my employer to say that I’ve been working in this capacity – that was the measure of the skill. It was interesting coz I, you know, my former employer, I got on really really well with him. So, they did really give me a good letter of reference. But I didn’t demonstrate my skills. You know, I just provided someone’s opinion of my skills. So, it was interesting for me to see how they imagine what skills are. How they articulate skills, particularly, in this context – you know in teaching, or design. They didn’t talk to any of my former students to find out if I was as skilled as I had mentioned. So, it was interested. I had to provide that letter from, as well as my reference, a letter from my employer to say that yes – I’d been working in the capacity of a senior lecturer position. I had over an x amount of time and had managed to demonstrate the skills required to perform that role. But they gave me a template for that letter for my employer to fill in. I think that was the university. So, it wasn’t even something that I had to write from scratch. Just had to fill in my name, job title, and the length of time. I guess the university knows what they’re looking for. They do this stuff all the time. But in terms of permanence, yeah I do really want to be here. We don’t want to go home. My daughter, the middle daughter – she’s 12, she’s been hearing that we’ve got a 4-year visa. She says, you know in 4 years I’m gonna be 16, im gonna be an adult, I can stay back by myself. So, if you go home to Scotland, you’ll be leaving me behind. Laughs. But yeah, I would like to see us translate that into a permanent visa. We think after the 3rd year, the university can sponsor me for PR. I did ask that in my interview, if I could go straight on to PR as opposed to TSS, and they said no. That would’ve been easier for me. I guess the added incentive was that the university was gonna pay for the relocation. \n",

      "L:\tSo, I think. So, the visa category was a working holiday visa, It was 2001. I don’t remember what the number was and I think that I. I came out in September, no I came out in May. So, I definitely know that I flew home on the day of the Sept 11th. So, I woke up and saw the twin towers fall, and thought to myself that I had to fly on a plane all the way to Scotland. I had 3 flights to get that day, and I remember, I woke up – and I was at my aunties in Brisbane coz she was gonna drive me to the airport to get my flight to Sydney. And I remember, just waking up, having breakfast and we’d put on the news, and just watching it happen, thinking, oh my goodness. I was phoning my mum and saying I can’t possibly be flying today, what am I gonna do. But actually, it was fine. It was a really interesting flight. Everybody was kinda shell shocked and there was no luggage, like, some planes were not running. I remember I had to wait for hours in London for a final connection. So, yeah it must’ve been 2000, and 2001 when I came home. Yeah, crazy. You just never forget.  So I didn’t plan to come to Australia on that working holiday visa actually. It was between my 2nd and 3rd year at college. I wanted to go to Japan. My cousin was working in Japan at the time, and I was studying textile design, and I remember saying to one of my teachers oh my cousin’s in japan. I’d really like to go and get some textile-based experience in Japan, take the summer break. We have an extended summer break in Scotland – so it’s like May to September. She said to me I think you don’t have enough knowledge or expertise yet to do any kind of work in that field, and I was gutted. So, I never went to Japan and that’s when I thought I’m gonna actually take some time off and go to Australia. So, WHV – I don’t remember how long it took but I don’t think it took long. I just remember you had to have a 1000 pounds in your bank on a statement to show for the. So that was 2001. Okay, so then we came back in Christmas 2011-2012. We came out for 4 weeks, just a tourist visa. We went to WA. So, we went up and down the coast of Western Australia. So yeah, and then I saw the job advert, and then I was invited out. So, when I came out, when I was invited out, they said, it was in the end of November, they said, well can you come out in the next 2 weeks, which was great – it fit in my schedule but I had applied online for a visa to come out, and it hadn’t come through. They booked my flights, they paid for all my flights to come out and had applied online – it was just a tourist visa, online on the government website, and it wasn’t coming, and it wasn’t coming, and it said it will just take 40 hours to 5 days, and the clock was ticking, the clock was ticking. The day before I flew, I phoned Australia to the government thing to say, I got up in the middle of the night to phone them and say, Im meant to be coming out, I’ve paid for my flights, I don’t have the visa yet, and he said yeah theres a backlog, theres nothing we can do, you shouldn’t have booked your flights until you had your visa, and I was like Oh God, whats happening, and I happened to have mentioned it to someone else. So, nobody knew I was coming out this week. I hadn’t told any of my friends or family because I wasn’t gonna say that Im going for a job interview in case I never got it. But I had told my mum and she had spoken to somebody at work who said she can get a tourist visa from the estate agent, no travel agent. So, you can get a tourist visa, you can pay 20 pounds at the travel agent in the UK anyway. Not sure about anywhere else and I’m not sure about what it’s called. So, the morning of the day that I flew, I went to the travel agent at 9 o clock, asked them to open the door and they gave me a visa for 20 pounds in about 20 minutes. And that overrides the visa. So about 3 days into my stay here, I got an email from the government site here to say that your visa application has been cancelled. I’m thinking, what’s wrong and then I realised that it was the one that I had done online. So, you can’t get visa on arrival for Australia for me, on a UK passport. They wouldn’t let me on a flight if I didn’t have a visa. So, that was my problem. My flight was gonna take 36 hours. So, I had asked what if my government one comes through by the time I arrive? Would that be okay? And he said, well you’re not allowed to leave Scotland unless you’ve got a visa in place. And it is exactly the same visa that the government would give you but it is a different name. Its just a tourist visa. They just click a few buttons and they give you this and it lasts for 3 months, which I think is the same as the government one. But its not in the government system. Although, it must actually go through the govt system because the govt system emailed me to say we realise you’re already in Australia so we’re gonna cancel this application. So, that was a bit of stress because the morning I was flying, I was like I don’t have a visa to get in. So, I arrived, then went home again, took the job, and then the visa’s came in 6th of January 19, and we booked our flights for 25th of Feb. I was scared to book the flights until the visas weren’t there. So it wasn’t the job I applied for but I knew as soon as I came for the visit that I was gonna do the job. Absolutely. And I said that to them. Although afterwards, the dean of the school, the boss, said I didn’t think youd actually were gonna do the job. I was like really! Why!. She was like, I knew you were adventurous, but I just thought it would be too big a move for the entire family. I said well.. I always found it interesting that people interview for jobs and have no intention of taking the job. I was always gonna take the job if I was interviewing for the job, if I got offered it. \n",

      "L:\tOkay so for visa prep, we had to have. So, that was a bit of a pest because they asked for all of this information over the Christmas break where everybody is shut, and everything’s closed. But we had to get two police checks. So my husband had to go get that. We had to pay for that. It was like $160 each. We had to have pay slips – 3 X payslips from both of us plus the annual tax review. We had to have the whole family’s birth certificates. I couldn’t find mine either. I found the abbreviated version but not my full one, and our marriage certificate. It was quite confusing because the university have an HR relocations person and I was issued with a contact person, and she was like my constant throughout. So, she provided me with all the information, kind of step-by-step, screen-shots of what you need to do, and usually its quite straight forward but some of the questions were, So she said – they recommended use a visa agent to do your visa application. I didn’t. They gave me list. So, they provided a list of people and companies who could do it for your visa, for schools, for accommodation. So, they provided that. I decided not to use an agent for the visa because I thought it was gonna be easy, and it was generally easy. The question that tricked me was the IELTS because I’m a national English speaker. Do I have to do IELTS? And I had to come back and ask that and she said no no, the university ticks that all for you. So, everything else was pretty straight forward. So, it’s a 2-part visa because its sponsored. So, the university had to submit all their paperwork to say that this this the post, and this is a post we can’t fill with anyone locally, the labour market testing, and then once they had their approved, they send it on to me to submit all my paperwork and the fee, and I think the fees, altogether was like $7000 for the family. The kids were quite cheap. That’s when you think we really should’ve used an agent because if that’s wrong then they can say were gonna keep that money. But luckily, it was all right. We didn’t need any medical checks. So, that surprised me because I had to have a medical check for my temporary working holiday visa. I was very surprised. What my visa does require is that I have private health insurance and I don’t know whether they think that if you have private medical insurance then you’re not gonna be a burden because you’re gonna pay for yourself but I had to tick … there were a few checkboxes that I had to tick to say that I was in good health. I’m not a bad person. But it was all self-check. I had to have... I had to supply 2 names and addresses for character witnesses to provide a character statement. I don’t know whether they were requested though. So, it was contact details for somebody to provide a character reference and I provided – one of my really good friends for the village is also a policeman. So, he certified all of my documents and he also provided a character reference – his email address and his address. I don’t think he had to sign anything to say it, but he had to agree in person. I don’t know whether they actually did that. I had to provide the letter of skills from my employer based on a template. Yea so, when the visas came back in January, they said well this is your visa paperwork and of course, it’s all just digital. So, it was just like a think you print out. But as a condition of your visa, you must have your health insurance. I’m like, yeah, that’s fine, I’ll do it. But, by the time I got around to doing it, it was like 3 days before we were leaving and I was like.. what if they ask me at the airport, have you got your health insurance and if I say ‘Not yet’, then they might not let me in through the border. Okay – so try to do it online. And there are a number of – the university game me a list of insurance people who would do the health insurance for me so I went through them – basically just trying to find the cheapest one coz UK health have a reciprocal agreement with Medicare so that still covers you for the basics and… like I finished work on the Friday, flew in the Saturday – this is the Wednesday, I thought I’d get this organised. Just between selling everything and saying goodbye to people, it just slipped my mind. So, it wasn’t through. I had submitted all the applications and done all the paperwork but didn’t receive a confirmation yet. So, I had visions of us being stopped at the airport. But actually, nobody said anything. In about a week that I was here, I actually phoned up the company that I had submitted my applications to to see – am I insured, whats happened and he said oh yeah we just need a bit more information and then we’ll back date it to the date you arrived. So, that was quite straight forward. I actually don’t know, I think I’m with NIB, but I don’t know what I’m insured for. Never used it. We’ve had three visits to the doctors for my kids since we’ve been here but just used Medicare. Nobody even asked for this. But it’s a condition of our visa. The condition of our visa is always have health insurance and I don’t take any work apart from this job but Alans open to work wherever he wants to work. My husband was worried about his police checks because he was arrested as a teenager for being drunk and disorderly. But, he’s like, he’s 46. So that’s a really long time ago but he was really anxious about it. But that was all fine. I don’t think there was anything that took long to come through or that was difficult to get. I guess in this whole process, we were realising how much money it was gonna cost and thinking is it worth it? Coz we had to pay the visa fees and we also – we have to education fees here. So, each of the kids, we have to pay the government fee of $5200 per child per year to go to school. So, that was gonna be extra. Its meant to be lump sum but we argued that I’ve got 3 kids. I cant afford that and all this. So, we’re paying in 2 blocks. It is still a lot of money. It wasn’t until a couple of weeks ago.. somebody said that, that’s actually a lot similar to some of the private school fees for primary, and you could’ve thought to put your younger one in private school. But actually, they’re settled in this school. Its interested because the schools don’t get that money. The schools get about, I think they said, about a hundred dollars extra but the government get that money. So, what am I paying that money for? Do you know what I mean – like if its not going to schools for providing education for my child. That was another reason I wanted PR at the start because then I don’t have to pay the school fees. \n",

      "L:\tAll the visa prep was all online. All submission of documents, even the police check, everything – it was all online which was simple, easy. I guess from, probably when I was invited out was when I started doing some actual online research thinking hmm this might actually happen. So, I… it was really difficult finding information about family migration and stories of family migration. I found one blog and I kept coming back to her information (I cant remember the name) – and it was things like thinking about schools, thinking about suburbs to live in, and she was just one person who actually migrated herself I think and its quite out of date. But everything I searched for, I just came back to her. So, it was this one woman blog. It was quite outdated but she had guest submissions to her blog. I guess she had guest submissions about visas and stuff. Why it was so difficult – there was lots of information about 457 but because 482 was so new, it was difficult. There was very little in terms of peoples experiences around it. That was difficult. I don’t Facebook, I don’t use FB. I have FB to have access to my kids dancing classes because that’s where they post that information, but I don’t use it as a networking thing. So, there was nothing on there that I looked at. But this suburb site – its like a suburb rating site – I used that a lot. And the problem with these kind of sites is that they’re like review sites but people only post negative reviews generally because there’s no incentive for you to post something positive. But, they were a good indicator of what a suburb was like I felt and so we did use that a lot for reviews and Domain and Real estate. I was really just wanting to find a resource that was about family migration but its fluid. There’s not such a thing as a resource. Who’s gonna keep it up to date? I’m sure there were those things where I clicked at something and there was a response in a forum but I never engaged in a forum. There are – although now – our house that we rented for a year, the owner, the house owner, out it up for sale about a month ago. I was like oh no were gonna have to move again, what are we gonna do. There were a couple of open houses and then it got sold. It got sold in the 2nd viewing, and the people who bought it are gonna continue having it as a rental so we can continue to stay there. So, we were like phew. But I did join the Sutherland shire community facebook page because I was looking for other houses in that area. There’s a buy and sell and swap page, but for me, I was hoping to find other accommodation on that site. Although I didn’t need to use it but that’s what I imagined I would use it for. \n",

      "L:\tSo def my cousin Stuart who was based here for most of the time. He was quite important. I guess he was important for providing that safe post box but also to know there was somebody here if something was to go crazy and also when I knew, so it wasn’t gonna be the job I applied for but there was gonna be a job, I needed to know that the money they were offering me was money that I could live on coz I actually had no idea. In the greater scheme of things – how much does it cost to live in Sydney, was I gonna be able to live on that wage. So, this is someone I could ask those questions to.. this is what theyre offering me. Is it worth it? Would I manage to live on that? And of course he said yes. So, he was like a sounding board. Martin here, who is my line manager. He is from Austria originally. So he’s a migrant too and he shared about his experience, and hes been here a long time now. It was helpful coz hes got kids too and he talked about what that was like. His kids are kinda similar ages as well. Lots of people at home in Scotland were really nice. So, when the community, they heard that we were moving they were like ‘Oh we’ve got family here, or we know this person’. So we got lots of addresses and phone numbers. We never followed up on any of them. But, I guess they’re all kinda there. We just haven’t had time. It was so fast. So, people were always happy to provide, you know like somebody, in this context that could help if you needed them. And, Amika, whos the HR relocation person – she was great because I sent her lots of emails to say…what about this, what about this, how long till I get my money back. I don’t know if there was anybody else. I did it all. Alan just got on the plane with the kids. He didn’t really do any of this. And then I guess we had the people at the stage that we sold our house. Actually, we put it up for sale when we were still there, but it sold after we left. So, my mum and dad were power of attorney to sign off on that.\n",

      "L:\tSo, when we arrived the kids… So in Scotland, the schools run from August to July. That’s the school year. But here the School year runs January to December. So, we moved in Feb.. they had already done 6 months of school – in the school here. So, when we got here, they had to go back 6 months which meant that they didn’t have to go to school straight away. They had about 6 weeks to get settled in before they went to school. So, Alan didn’t work that time, and it was good for me because it meant I could focus on getting to work, finding my feet, not having to worry about childcare and that kind of this. So, that was the first 6 weeks. Then we moved into our house in Sutherland shire so that was a couple of weeks before school and then there was Easter holidays. So, he said he’d probably go to work after Easter holidays. They went back to school after Easter holidays and he started looking for things, for jobs, but there was nothing really. I don’t that he was actively looking, and then there was summer holidays. My daughter got sick in between so she missed about 2 weeks of school in that term so he was off for that, which was okay. And then there was the summer holidays. So, it was like, okay, after the summer holidays, and after the summer holidays I had to go to Malaysia. So it was like, okay after I come back from Malaysia. So now the kids are back into school and hes gonna have to start looking for something. But hes gonna look for something part-time so he can work around the kids. He fancies a career change but he doesn’t know what and he isn’t the kinda, you know, hes in a new place, perfect place to have a career change. But the longer hes gonna think about it, the harder it is going to be for him to get a job. You know, the confidence, and so on. But he needs to build a network, so I feel he needs to get a job, and I’ve been trying to do that in a diplomatic way. Laughs. But, it’s just not happening. So, he is, he doesn’t really do online coz internet was after he left school and all that. But he does do Gumtree coz that’s where he was looking at cars, on Gumtree, coz we don’t have a car yet. So, that’s what hes focusing on at the moment. But, he does the school run in the morning. So, he sees all the parents and stuff but the area that we live in, its more of a – its not really a city – its more of a suburb. So a lot of the mums don’t work.. theres a lot of stay at home mums.. so its mostkly mums at school who actually don’t really speak to him. But he has made… so we have 2 sets to neighbours that we have become good friends with and he has 2 other neighbours – one is 70 and one is 80 – and they keep knocking on our door to ask him to come and do little jobs, like lift things, or fix this, or fix that. Every time he does that, they try to pay him and hes like no I’m not taking money for this. So he comes home with these things.. he came home with a golf set.. he came home with a mixer… theyre just giving him stuff. So, hes been meeting people but he doesn’t have a network of people who are the same age, and I think that’s what he would need for him to get into work. And I think, its difficult coz our roles have completely been reversed as well. So, he was the main breadwinner and now hes not working at all, and I’ve got a network here and he doesn’t have that. So, its difficult for him. I don’t doubt that its difficult for him, and that makes him homesick. And because he was away working offshore a lot of the time, so he didn’t have the time with the kids. So, its nice for him to have that. But he has to adjust to what that feels like because it isn’t all roses like he imagines it. The kids are grumpy in the morning and he gets annoyed about making lunches, and da da da.. so I think, its just gonna take some time. \n",

Think time around, it just happened so quickly, I just went with the flow. Usually I’m really, I do a lot of research. I’m a researcher, that’s what I do. But this time, it was almost like it happened. I didn’t expect it to be so easy and I did not expect the visa to come through so quickly and I think its because of the university in part because it’s a huge institution and they do this regularly. One of the big concerns I had coming was disrupting the kids, you know they had friends, and their lifestyle. So, I was really wanted to make sure that.. So, my daughter dances and my son does jujitsu. So, I wanted to find somewhere that they could get back into this stuff straight away. So that had a lot to do choosing the location as well. And I did use that Sutherland shire FB page to see what dances available, what jujitsu places. So, I guess that helped get recommendations because theres 100’s of dance schools. Whats a good dance school. So I did use that. There was, one of the first weeks, in our house. There was a local newspaper that came through, and it was volunteer week, and there was a call out for volunteers to go visit older people, elderly people. So we had a chat at home and we thought well lets sign up for that because the kids don’t have their grannies anymore… just that intergenerational connection. But we never got around to that. That’s on my list to do because I think that they’re missing that and if they can give that to somebody who doesn’t have that, that would be a good thing. But, its just time. \n",

But in terms of challenges, I guess its just that things online – particularly for academic migration – were framed around the single academic, and not with their family because threes a lot of movement within academic staff but not always with kids and a husband. And even, the information from the immigration adviser was framed around, okay what does it mean for me to come as a single person, but I was like, I’m also coming with 3 kids. What does that mean for US? So, that’s the main one. But then nobody’s got exactly the same story. So, I don’t know what I was looking for. Its constant movements with academics and actually now that Im here, there’s lots of international staff here, and there was lots of international staff in my previous job as well but you just kind of take it for granted when you’re home. You don’t really think that they’re going through all this visa stuff in the background. But academia is international. I do quite a lot of travelling with work anyway. Not so much here, greanted. But last 2 years have been 5 or 6 destinations a year. So, I’m quite happy to navigate that system. I guess maybe for Alan who doesn’t do that much travelling, hes anxious he doesn’t have a physical visa in his passport. So, when I did my first move we both had the WHV stuck in our passport – like something like China do now. But now everything’s online, so he feels anxious coz he doesn’t have something to say that he’s entitled to be here. He’s looking for that physical stamp that says he can be here, especially at airports. It doesn’t bother me much but I know that it causes him some anxiety. \n",

We have to think about what will happen to his education, and then we have to think about university. In Scotland university is free if you’re a Scottish resident. You don’t pay any fees. But you’ve got to be living in Scotland for 3 years before you apply for university. So, if we stay here for 4 years, he will be the age to go to university, and if we go home to Scotland, we would have to pay for his education. He won’t get that free coz he would’ve been out of the country. I think we’re imagining that we’re not gonna go back but that will be something we think about if we were to move somewhere else. \n",

But, its just so expensive here that we don’t know if we will buy a house or we’ll just rent, or will we move elsewhere in Australia. Again, that will be dictated by my post, my job, whether it will be a promotion or just a similar role in another area. Definitely be open to looking at, although I love it here, but potentially somewhere norther, where its cheaper for houses. Because we come over with just suitcases, we spent the first 3 months just buying furniture, looking for furniture, or like cutlery… all of the things you don’t really miss until you’ve got to use them. So, I’ve just got a dining table to get and a car – those are the two things. We’re actually looking for a van so we can go away and things, you know, we can put bikes at the back or the surfboards at the back. One thing I do love about Sydney is the public transport. It’s just so easy and so cheap. It’s just so so cheap compared to Scotland. So cheap. Im in the highlands of Scotland where the infrastructure is really poor, the buses run, like, every hour and the train network doesn’t reach anywhere you need to go. So, I’m loving the public transport. So, we go to the beach. Most Sundays were at the beach. Saturdays, the kids have clubs – dancing and all those things. But once we have a van, the idea is that we’ll go on a Friday night and come back on Sunday. Once we had decided to come, I was thinking Oh God, theres gonna be no house that we can afford. Everythings gonna be super expensive. The housing is super expensive. But in terms of food, like its pretty much the same that we pay in Scotland. For paying the bills, electricity and gas is cheaper than what we were paying in Scotland. So, I guess we are.. actually, we’re on one wage but probably living the same quality of life that we were in Scotland which is good. Just 70% of my wages in going on accommodation which is crazy. Super crazy. Everything else is alright. That’s another reason why Alan needs to start working. Im really conscious... I don’t want to start chipping away our house money coz oce we start, its gonna be gone.

I don’t want it to be a situation where in 5 years down the line I’d be thinking – I had an opportunity or I had a chance, and I didn’t take it. So that was one of the reasons. The other motivation was like.. so being married for like 5 years, I was sort of thinking if we plan a family, or whenever we start planning a family, if we have a base in a secure or better environment, well get good benefits out of it. And also the passport advantage that Australia has, or the government benefits that anyone gets over here. I mean like, back in our country, you know the facilities we get – be it education, or medical benefits we get, or the advantage that the Australian passport has – so that 3,4 reasons were the motivations. The major motivation factor for me was my wife. She was like, I think you are saturated over here. You need to try something new and that’s where we started.

Was it skilled migration. ', '', '', '', 'Ma:\\tIt was skilled migration. So when we started the journey, my friend was one of the main motivation or motivator for me to try it out. So back in India, I used to trade in stock market as a past time. I made money, I lost money. So the way my friend convinced me was – you would have lost like 50 grand easily in stock market. Why not spend 50,000 for this – do your skills assessment and give a English test – be it IELTS or be it Pte – so why to spend 50k and see if you can score a good, if you can get a good assessment, why not try it out. So that’s how we started. So started collecting all my experience documents relating to it. So then, last – so back in India, I had my 12 years of experience – I worked with like 6 different employers and like fortunately, I had a very good relationship with both of them. And I spoke to them and I said that I need an assessment roles and responsibilities letter from you stating that this is the role that I did, and this is the responsibilities I had and I worked full time – whatever format I need. And we got that letters within 10-12 days. Its like I was fortunate enough that all my managers or managers in that point in time were still there in the organisation. I just had to drop a mail, give them a call and they were like okay. So, the first question they asked me was – what do you want in that letter? I was like I have already given you. You just have to validate that and give it to your HR. If youre fine with the format and whatever I have written into it, then you can go ahead and tell your HR and get it signed and send it back to me, or Ill come to collect it, if theres a need. Since I had a very good relationship with them, they were more than happy to do that stuff. And yeah, as I said in 12 days I got all the letters.  The other thing was cracking the English test. I was, like, deciding between PTE and IELTS test. So, I did some search, spoke to couple of friends, went to migration forums, understood which one is easier to crack. Then decided that PTE is the one because one can fool computer algorithm and crack the exam, but.. When I say ‘fool’, its just that, you don’t have to right or wrong – you just have to pronounce few words in a particular way and the algorithm will understand that yes, this person can speak in native English. In IELTS there is a person sitting in front of you. He or she may be biased. He or she may not like what you are saying. Or he or she may judge you based on the way you are communicating, even if you are giving the right answer, they may say that the person is not understanding. Whereas for a computer, you just have to say things in a way that the algorithm wants to hear it. And with some practice tests…and… first attempt, I didn’t crack it, I mean, I didn’t get the score that I wanted. Second attempt, I got the score. Then I did the, by that time I got the ACS assessment done, and it assessed all my working years as a relevant experience. So, I happened to be with highest age points, highest experience points with English score.

So I’ve been working with Data, built in Data warehouse, dashboards – all like, last 10+ years. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhen you said passport advantage, what do you mean by that?', '', '', '', 'Ma:\\tSo like, for example with an Indian passport, I have to apply almost every country in the world to get entered or even for a visitor visa. But, with an Australian passport, there are certain advantages. Like, for example, like, every Indian or every sub-continent guy has a dream of working in US, and day by day, it is getting difficult. Australia has an e3 migration clause with the US which has about 10k migrants, I mean, they can take about 10,000 skilled migrants which only gets filled by 1/4th every year, from Australia to US – people applyimg for work permits etc. So, US has a streamlined arrangement with Australia where they allow like lets say, for H1B, they have a pool for 10,000 lets say. In the same way Australia has, lets say, 5000, which, out of it, only 1000 gets filled. So even if you read todays newspaper, US is trying to give that share, or whatever pending quota, to Ireland. So now, lets say. So, Ill give you an example of my friend, who took an Australian passport and applied for a US thing, and hes now in US. He took like 6 years time to get to US, but now he can work indefinitely, I mean some sort of arrangement wherein he doesn’t have to go via H1B or something.

I mean you can go anywhere in the world, and work, or visit, or do anything. I mean like for example – I can give you a recent example. A funny thing happened. My sister and her family were supposed to visit us over here, in 2nd week of May. But their visa got rejected for the stupid reason like, um, there’s no, um, there’s no definite ties with India. I mean they are not going to go back. I mean, they said there is no surety that you will go back. I mean like, shut up. They showed a very good bank balance, they had a return ticket showing that they were gonna go back, they have a settled business over there. But still they didn’t get it. I am literally shocked. I mean my nephews and nicer – they were crying over there. Theres no option of appealing it – in tourist visa. You have to reapply it. So now, with an Indian passport, they struggled. So for example now, if I want to travel with an Australian passport, Ill be taken with arms open. I mean I don’t have to worry at all of getting a visa. I get an on-arrival visa from 100% countries.

Right now, I work for an in-house IT team where I am one level below to what I used to do. But yeah, im in my field. The kind of work I used to do, I am doing that.

Going to Canada was one of them because I have my aunt staying over there. So, I can get an additional relative points and I could easily go over there. But I didn’t consider Canada just because it was too cold over there. There was an option of Germany where I can get a 6 months temporary work permit, where I could go over there, find a job, find a sponsor, and I could get a work permit over there. Or a temporary permanent residency over there. Then the 4th option was about moving to the middle east. I mean, it was always open. I mean, twice or thrice I rejected the options that I had – moving to the middle east for a bigger role or bigger opportunity. I didn’t feel comfortable over there because of the restrictions it had. Like, I have to be, like, I was there for a week in Saudi Arabia and I was like, terrified. I cant even take a picture of myself. If someone is there in my background, they might come and just ask me. So, I was there in Dubai. I liked Dubai a bit. The only thing, like I was apprehensive coz lets say one fine day, my employer says I cant, I don’t want you to work over here anymore. I have to again find a sponsor or else I have to come back. Like, I have seen cases where people have worked for 15 years, their kids were born over there but they have to come back. I didn’t want that to happen with me. I wanted something, like wherever we go, we stay. And also the other thing was, the parents thing. I mean, I thought about, like, if we move to Australia, theres a possibility that I can take my parents, which, I don’t think that Canada had that option, there were some conditions. And also weather wise, like my mom has high BP and some sort of heart thing so I thought she might not be able to adjust over there.

Me, my parents, my grandmother, my sister – so 5 of us staying in 150 sq ft place. They struggled hard. My mom and dad ensured that me and my sister gets the best of education. So because of my dads learning and experience, he played a key role in terms of deciding the way I think about things, or the way I see things. And my wife, like, last 6 – yeah we will be completing 6 years years in a few weeks. So yea in last 6 years she has played a very important role in terms of calming me down or, asking difficult questions to me, like whether you want to really do it, whether youre happy. Shes been a very good support system for me in the last 6 years. Even for coming over here – I was a bit scared, so she was like do you really wanna do that? I you don’t want to, you don’t have to do that. And then she was like, lets take a chance. Lets see what things has in store for us. And were here – in 7.5 months we have a job – both of us have a job, we bought a car. Wife’s into day care. Because she likes being around kids. By the way, shes an interior designer by profession but she didn’t want to study over here again. So, last work she did back in India was working with a day care. So, she was very comfortable with the kids. So, she was ready to study about day care and getting cert 3 in daycare or diploma in child care.

During the process I did make good friends, in terms of via PR whatsapp groups, Expat forums, theres a community, or theres an app called discord for gamers but there was a guy – he has created a discord channel wherein..So discord has all these channels, and one can ask questions about the assessment, so this is not only for people asking for PR related questions.

Like, say for example, for whatspp, the topics can get diverse anytime, and one cannot keep track of things.

I can put the initial thought as well. Started collected documents for skills assessment from December 2017 and then I applied for ACS in December 17 and then I did my PTE. I got results in Feb 18 from ACS – positive assessment. The document certification, I did everything when I was submitting for ACS. I did PTE twice in Jan 18 within the span of 10 days. First time I gave it, I didn’t get the required score. I wanted a 79+ - I didn’t get it. So, second time I decided let me try again because, at that time it was a tight race. And as we know that the doors are closing. So I had taken a – PTE, has a PTE gold test kit. Its like course, but its like, how the actual exams pan out. So, they have silver, gold, and platinum. So ,silver is one test, gold is 2 tests and platinum is 3 tests. So, 3 practice tests and it does a similar evaluation – how the actual test is evaluated.

So, it just gives you an idea about the trends. But expat forum was like – THE platform for me – where I could find – all the answers were available on that. So, within expat forum, I happened to meet – I happened to be a part of whatsapp groups. Then from whatsapp groups we got the discord community wherein right now, about 300 people are there.

But yea, Indians in Sydney – a bit. But yea, its become a piece of a joke. I mean everyone on it is cracking jokes. People ask a serious question and people are just making memes of it. So telegram is also an app wherein one can post in different groups. So, theres couple of clients that I know. They were running like 5 different types of preparing groups – one was only about preparing for IELTS or PTE, one was only about preparing for pre-PR process, documentation and helping people with documentation, one was only for post PR wherein after getting the PR what should one do about migration checklist and then there was a jobs group. Since whatspp has a limitation of 256 people, telegram doesn’t have any limitation. One doesn’t even need to know the phone number because it can be based on email ID. One does have to get a link to join a group and then they can join it. Even discord is something like where no one knows your mobile number or email ID. Its your discreet identity, whatever you want it to be, because people think about the security point of view as well. I don’t want to share my mobile number with anyone so Ill tell you – this whatsapp group became a problem after I migrated over here because people were calling on whatsapp. I happened to be an admin of one of the groups that I was a part of initially. People were giving me a call at night at like, 2 o clock, 3 o clock because back in India it was like 9 or 10 in the evening. They used to give me a call, like, Mithun, we are at so and so points, do we have a chance, or people who already got the PR – did you get a job, do we stand a chance, do you have someone you can recommend us. But I couldn’t… so I left that group and said that I am part of this discord community so if anyone wants to have a question, I am free to answer over there. Whatsapp – So I was part of 3 different groups. Each had about 150-200 people. One was only specific to my skillset. It was defined only for business analysts and systems analysts. They had about, like, 150 people. There was a generic group only for people applying for 190 or state sponsorship for NSW. It had about like 200+ people. And there was a generic 189 group where everything was there. On an invite day – or when there is an invite round, there might be around 200-300 messages within an hour. Like 12 o clock Australian time, the invite round starts. So by 1 o clock Australian time, there would be like 300 messages. People might be asking questions like did anyone get an invite. If one said I got an invite, there would be 200 people saying congratulations. Or if one gets a PR, there would be 200 people saying congratulations, you got a PR.

So I guess, when we were taking a decision, it was a collective decision. So first one was why – but I wanted my parents as well as my in-laws - my wifes parents to say yes about it. They need to be in a positive mind, they need to support us, they need to say yes. If they said no, we wouldn’t be over here.

So, I was supposed to go to US but all this visa challenges etc.. So, the alternative I was considering was Canada and Australia. Right, couple of options. Among that the favour in Australia was the weather and also the thing about Australia was the dual options to work in Australia and NZ. NZ is slightly behind from global opportunity standards but still it gives you multiple options. So, and also, if you look from an economy standpoint right, Australia looked like more opportunities available compared to Canada. So, these were more educated guesses from what I could find in research. This made me, and, more than anything, the process also was much more convenient and easier compared to the other parts – Canada or any other countries for that matter. And one more driving factor was when I shortlisted, English was a big factor coz if you try Europe or anything, the language barrier comes in. Australia was a big win and Canada as well when it comes to the local language. I started my career in India. So, pretty much born and brought up in India. Then I went to the US for 4 years, then came back. Then for about 3-4 years we were trying to go back to the visa process, you know with the economy changing, it got rejected again and again. So, then I took a couple of years off to decide what I wanted to do. But then myself and my partner thought it would be maybe good to just explore. Even now we’ve come here – we don’t know what’s gonna happen even 2 years from now. So, we’ve just come here to explore and so far, it’s been good.

I’ve worked with US banks, UK banks and how here with Australian banks. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHow did you Plan your migration?', '', '', '', 'Ay:\\tSo, the reason was not migration. We just wanted to go, and travel new places, just to see different cultures. So, it was US and UK for a while. So, Australia compared – 1 was work visa was an option but compared to that PR was slightly better. At least at the time I decided to apply. It was more like, lets apply and see how it goes. It was not like I want to go king of this. It was more like let’s just give it a shot and see if it works out then we’ll give it a shot. It was more like, baby steps. So, it’s very short. We started our thought process sometime like November 2016, and after a year and half I was here. Nov 2016 was when the idea crept in. One of my friends suggested. So, the thing about Canada – because a couple of my friends stay there – but we thought about Canada. There were a couple of factors – the cold etc. So, when you start talking to your colleagues or close friends, we thought, okay why not Australia. We started to do some research over the net – it was the immiforum, everything. What we found was it was very simple. Whether it’s a right thing or wrong thing, that’s a different thing – but it was very simple. What all they want was very quantifiable. So, it was just – we started addressing one by one, whatever needs to be done. Thankfully, the forums were very (what do you say) very explanative. Immiforum. One of my friends gave me the link. There are people who list A to Z of what needs to be done. So, you don’t need to worry about anything, you just follow. I think Immiforum, I don’t remember. When I started off, one of my friends suggested this forum site. So, you know when you search migration to Australia – one of the first thing that comes up is do you want to go to a migration agent who can help you with things. So, that’s was the call I had to make. Do I want to consult someone? Then I started with this forum. Anybody who knows how to work with computers could do it. It was pretty straight forward. So, I said we don’t need to spend that money. So,  then the thing was trying to get into what are the steps we need to do. So, Nov-Dec – December was pretty much trying to understand, alright what do we need? So, a bunch of English tests. So, we gave IELTs. That’s when I realised, I couldn’t write for nuts. So, you for for 10 years, with IELTS its back to basics. It was like school. So, I gave it a shot. Still, I was just getting 60 points. I was like okay this cannot be good enough. So next thing I did was I gave the ACS. That was a big shocker for me because they figured my 6 years of experience was not valid. So, I had close to 12 years of experience at that point, but they deducted 6. So, my points again went down to 55. [Laughs]. Then I decided to take the PTE. One of my friends suggested that. It’s a computer-based test and it was very interesting. I blogged it. I studied for a week or so. During that time there was an emotional turn in my family. My mother in law had a heart attack. I was in the hospital for a week so couldn’t prepare much. Then I called PTE to reschedule and they told me because it was less than 72 hours or something, so can’t reschedule. So, I just went there and took the test just like that and fortunately I got 20 points out of it. It was my first attempt and I did not prepare well for it. I just knew what the pattern was. So, that’s when I realised probably my English was ok. Sometimes it takes a test for you to know what your strengths are. So, 2 IELTS and 1 PTE. So, once I had that, I already had 70 points with me without even my partners points. So, I just went and submitted the EOI in April. That’s when they told me that since I was in the US for 4 years, I had to get the police verification done. That was the biggest thing. So, there again the forum helped me understand what I needed to do. That was the biggest process. So, I submitted the EOI. Had to do all the yards post US. That was the biggest challenge because now I heard you have tracking numbers but in 2017, they didn’t have. So, you had to send it to them, wait for 12 weeks, email them, call them to check if they have received because you have no tracking number, and this was like, you have to hand-write and post it via DHL to them. So, they don’t confirm to you. So, you have to keep on tracking yourself. So, I was more concerned about that police check than anything else. Good story was that within a couple of months I already got the invite. The first round – because I think from April to June was the freeze period, they don’t process the applications. So, one of my friends said you have the state nomination but since then, when I saw the trends, you know the immi trends, it was very quick. You know, the first round, I got the invite. So, I got all the other documentations in place but I was still waiting for the police clearance from the US because they gave us 2 months. Then I realise that when they sent the post to India, it gets lost. So, then I called them to change the address to post to my friend who lives locally in the US. So, when I started reading, people were saying that usually for India, it gets lost. So, they gave me an option to fill a form and submit change of address. So, I gave my friends address who stays in the US because you don’t need a physical copy. You just snap. So, as soon as he got it, he just sent me the snap through Whatsapp. So, using all that I was able to initiate my visa. So, once the visa was applied there was nothing to do, just waiting for it. So, they told it takes 9 months. So, I put it at the backburner and just continued to work, whatever I was doing. And the the CO gets assigned. I was checking every 15 days or so, nothing happened. But just, after the 30th day or 45th day I got the letter directly. I didn’t get any CO or anything. I got the PR grant straight forward. It was very smooth. So, I think I did something right. [Laughs]. So, the thing I was saying is that on the forums its pretty elaborate. So, since you work in the IT field you know how to name the documents and stuff. So, I made sure I have my own check list, you know, what I need, and do the forms etc. in parallel. So, it’s very quick from the time of initiation in April to receiving it. October 31st my letter was in hand. In India I had a 3 months’ notice period. So, you can’t move before 3 months. The good news was that I had 1 years’ time. So, it came in Oct, and I had until next year September (to move). So the 2 schools of thought were either continue working, bring your wife here, put a port up and go back. Then we decided it would be too much hassle. I was okay, what the hell, I’ll come here first, try for couple of months to get a job. So, decided okay, lets one of us go, while she can continue working there. So, see how it goes and then. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tCommunity?', '', '', '', 'Ay:\\tSo, first part was here I knew no one. Absolutely no one. So, at that point I didn’t even have people to tell me there were FB groups – the Indian groups in Sydney. When I researched on Sydney, random groups were coming. I did not even know they were people – Gumtree was something. Thankfully, I had a very close friend of mine from my previous company who had a very close friend here. So, probably a month before I decided to come, he just connected us. He said yeah just come and you can stay at my place. So, accommodation was settled but overall it was a challenge because, you also know, there’s still a little bit of bias. So, people, the agents who was supposed to give.. like.. you don’t get any opportunity. So, I was getting interviews on and off but still I came here March. So, Easter was April and pretty much April was pretty slow. So, not getting much done. Coincidentally there was a guy who worked for me in India. So, he used to work for HCL. So, he just told me, you just share with me your profile. So, I sent it to him. He sent it to someone, and the 3rd day someone called me and said that there’s an interview, would you like to attend. I said ok and that’s how I got this job. So, from what it looks like from here is not that bad. But at that time 3 months was pretty frustrating. Nothing much to do. To be precise, exactly, I got my offer in 2 months. Then the background verification took about 2 weeks. So, less than 3 months I was in a job.

So, what are the driving factors – one, environment – from India you know, there is so much pollution. So, my son was falling pretty sick there. We are from the South – Chennai. We were not really sure why my son was falling very sick but from all my friends who were abroad, they would say, the probability is slightly lesser. So, we were like let’s give it a shot and see how he adapts. So, we felt it could work out better because he had this case. Its call febrile fits, its seizures, febrile seizures and theres no reason for it. So, he had these, little bit if health issues. So, we thought let’s go abroad and see how it will work. So, I came here and my wife was still back. So, the initial idea was I’ll come, get a job, work for 3 months, get some income and then I’ll bring my wife and son along. But, it so happened in the 3 months, my son was missing me so much. There was so much pressure on me for them to come here soon. So, the day I got the job, the 15th day I found a place – whichever place they gave me coz then I learnt a little bit about the rental history as well. Its not just the job. They don’t give you for first, like first time rental is not easy. Apparently, I was blessed, there was this one guy, this one agent who trusted me. He said, it you want it you can take it. I just want 12-month lease. But that was a hell. There was one day I saw 15 houses on a Saturday. I didn’t have a car and I walked 13 km that day starting from… so I had a calendar with me where I was listing from Rhodes till Westmead. I saw Rhodes, Denniston, Parramatta, Westmead – so I saw close to 15 houses in that day. So, the houses which were good had 50 people looking. So, I stand no chance. Houses which had no one, I didn’t like those places. So, after that finally one house was okay, not an issue. The agent said okay. So, that worked out. So, the day the rental was sorted, the same day I booked my flight back home. So, the first salary, I just booked a flight. I went over there for 3 days because I didn’t get a holiday. So, I went home, brought them. Prior to that, first month salary, I just went to IKEA, bought few stuff, went for the electronics, and a friend in Melbourne put it on some card she had that gives you 5 years interest free of something. and one more friend lent me some money and said just keep it. Give it to me after 2 months. And, so with all said and done, in a matter of one month from the time I joined, I had my family here. That’s what happened.

But the other factor why I really want to leave HK is because this event happened – it’s a political movement called umbrella movement. So, what happened is that most of the HK youngsters trying to get a real democracy system to choose their – we call chief executive, but basically, the mayor of HK. We didn’t get a very fair system for doing that. Umm but that is one of the thing that get me really disappointed with HK. So, I guess that can go into it as a political reason. This is getting me very frustrated with the political climate in HK. Like the govt can do anything because at the end the movement, I mean, during this time of the movement they are a lot of youngsters that go for protests and they just sit on the road for ages, I think that go on for months. But then at the end the govt actually didn’t do anything. They just clear the site. It actually poliriased the entire society in HK.

I think I can write police check in HK. And then so, the difficult part is that it want me to get the finger printing and then also they only accept paper application. So they don’t have an online system. So, yeah its very confusing because HK is a big city and everything but then, it can be vert backward at times – paper application. The challenge is that the finger printing is not that easy because you don’t do it at home. They want me to go a police station locally and do that. But then normally in Australia they don’t ever do that kind of service for normal people. So, I called up the police station and they only … umm.. one thing. They don’t normally do it, They only allow you to do it locally in the police station that is closest to your suburb. So Im living in Quakers hill so they only want me to go to that one police station. You cant even get to parramatta or any other station. You only have to go to the really local local suburb. So the PS doesn’t normally do it. And then when I call them up, like I called them several times but then they were saying oh, if they have someone that’s retained in their, like, I don’t know, they have someone that’s retained in their room then they cant access the system to do that. So, I don’t know, maybe there are a lot of criminals around. Everytime when I called them up they were like, Oh we have someone in the room – sorry. So that too me, you know, really long time to do that. Like a month – to just to get a fingerprint. And then after that, because they only accept paper applications, they also charge me money. So, to do the payment is also quite difficult because they want cheque, you know paper cheque, which is very ancient. You know we don’t use that.

Its very rare, but there are some people migrating from HK, they are experiencing exactly the same thing (forum).

After that, for the post-graduate and the residence, that’s when I started relying on the social – heavily because when I was in Canberra, I was .. the group of friends that I had were also going through the residence process as well and there was lot of knowledge that was not a part of online research or something like. When I was telling you about the wife of this friend who was working in the dept of immigration, who was saying like, okay this is the moment for you to apply, double check this, not from a professional perspective but from a, like, friend-ish perspective. It was like ‘I know something. I won’t tell you what it is but I recommend you to do this at this moment.’ Also, I was babysitting at the time and the people that I met during … the clients and all that, were a part of the Mexican community, well, Latin community and they were extremely supportive for everything.

It was just internal, like, I was just extremely stressed about certain things, as in, what if there was something not in my knowledge, super stressed like, do I need to do more things, do I need to do more checks, and I was just, particularly stressed about that for the postgraduate and the residence.

I also think that they are double checking certain visa’s like the 475 when it comes to you know, cases of, they need to make sure that there are no human rights violated. So, I think of course that’s a good thing. In 2017 or 2018 when they were going to change the requirements for residence and for the citizenship. That was, of course it came out of the blue and I was going through the process of the residence and I think I submitted the application like a week before that or something like that. So, the good thing was that I was sort of relaxed that I put that EOI before that happened, and then I was doing the residence I was affected by all these changes that they were doing. I was wondering how this is going to affect me. That’s one of the reasons why I went to the lawyer – how is this going to be affecting me... just double checking that it is going to be fine. It didn’t affect me because they didn’t do any changes at the end. So, I was doing the process when they announced and I was like, ah, this is going to affect me. But because I had the EOI before, it didn’t affect me and then at the end they didn’t change anything. For the citizenship, if, well, I guess all those changes affect in how the pressure you feel to do things now.

I feel like I was constantly pursuing something and that instability, it was, like I was stressed about I don’t know whats going to happen, and then at one point, it was okay I’ve been enough in Australia and if I don’t get the residence, I don’t think that I can go back home and get used to that lifestyle again.

Couple of things – I think the first and the foremost was about visa. So, Singapore’s visa and PR laws are very very difficult. Almost all Indians are not getting their PR in this point of time, and the work visa is only for 2 years. So, renewing your work visa is difficult and company sponsoring work visa is difficult as well.

In Singapore, you go into a bank and I think in 5 minutes you have everything ready. Your credit card, your bank card, everything. Here, the bank account opening took a few hours and then for the credit card as well, we couldn’t get a credit card because we did not have any credit history and then even when we got one, we couldn’t get one which we could use to get points for our expenses that we did.

Just for future stability, we’ll take the decision from the point of view of again, visa, if we plan to have a family, Australia is a better place to have a family, point of view of owning a house, owning a car – things that Singapore will never allow us, and in Australia those options are possible. I think the big thing was the weather Singapore’s weather is definitely not the best weather. Those reasons – we did go back and forth and even in the first year we weren’t sure that we made the right decision.

He had been here a really long time and his.. his take was, we live in paradise.

I think I have learnt a lot here as well. I never drove in my life. Im driving now. The country has a lot to offer. Again, if you think of having a family and future, we definitely think we would like to bring our child in the world in this country rather than other places where we’ve been before. Will we always be in Australia? We’re still not sure on that because again I still love Singapore a lot so if, in the future, if we do happen to get a permanent residency for Australia, probably we’ll see if there is an opportunity to move back to Singapore just because I like the country and its closer to home. Maybe ill put my father on the map just because it was important that I spoke with him and he was extremely for Australia. So, that I think gave us the confidence and boost that we’re making the right decision. For both of us, I think we really look up to my father.

There were some disagreements [between me and husband]. I really liked Singapore, There was no problem, I still had my visa, he would have got a job easily – his skillset is in demand. So, yeah, it was, that was the number 1 challenge. The second challenge, Im just gonna mention in terms of moving. Second was, I did know not know even till the visa process had started, if my company will move me here. [going back] I also researched about employment opportunities here. So, I had started talking to employment agencies here to see if I will get a job here. So that was the challenge before we moved here. Once we moved, I guess, should I write about things like not having a car/mobility. Also, not having enough funds in the beginning because we didn’t move all our funds to a different country. So, we had to really think about spending or where we were spending, bank, credit card, and just for everything – in terms of how the country operates, from transport to opal card to what you do – there was nobody to tell us that. So, I guess general country whereabouts. So, there was a lot of self research that we were doing about it. So, Although here I would say – his company, they had a portal where expats go and talk about different things on – whether its about opal card or its about your wife finding a job. I think that was a big thing because that portal has a lot going on about expats. So, in their internal portal, people post that – like my wife is looking for a job, bla bla. They also share experiences very very openly where they talk about x has happened, what’s going on, just very open. They do have meet-ups where people who don’t speak English, they meet up, and wives will meet up, so a lot of that is there. But that’s about it. There’s groups on Facebook and Social media where, I haave seen specifically, like Indians in Sydney, people looking for jobs and stuff. So, I’ve seen those groups as well. I am a part of this group om Facebook but I have don’t have any input on that group but I find out about anything that’s happening in Sydney – any event or anything.

I wanted to meet more people and I did not have a job that consumed a lot of time. So, I became a part of volunteering organisations. So, the first thing I did was… this was last year… I went and registered myself with NSW volunteering group where there was a training, they just talked about what volunteering is. I had to go and get a working with children check done so I got that done, and there was a police check done as well, so got both done, and with that I currently volunteer with 2 groups – one is St Vincent for youth. So basically, they have events planned every month or every 2 months for youth. They only cater to children, who are from a disturbed family. So, refugees or anyone who has domestic violence in the family, or their parents are disturbed. So, they just take this kids to a move, or a park or something and we just have to be with the kids for the day as volunteers. I do that sometimes. And then Im also part of NSW volunteering but the Lane Cove or the city council which is community service. So, there is somebody in an aged care facility that I go visit twice a month. So, I enjoy meeting this aged care person a lot more than the youth part, because it’s a one-on-one meeting.

I think for the longest time we were waiting for his company to apply because after 2 years, his company could apply for our PR but that comes with a bond of some time that he still has to work there and we have to share the cost. So, there’s a percentage that we have to also pay. Whereas, if he applied on his own then theres no bond and we don’t know if the laws are going to change so we don’t want to be waiting for that. So, he started the process. Obviously if we have the company to apply, the process would have been easier but hes still working on it. I think he should be able to apply for his skills assessment in the next 2 weeks and then study for his English exam. This has been very challenging because he had to get documents from India which is not easy for all the employers, the letters that they are asking for. He has worked for a company that has been taken over twice. So its very difficult for him to get documentation from that first company that no longer exists. So, that’s one of the challenges. He had his own company as well which got dissolved so getting documentation for that is very difficult. So, his paperwork collection for skills assessment is very difficult. I cant do it as a primary applicant as well because, like I said, Im an HR manager but here I only get identified as a HR adviser.

Just because of my husbands skill set, he gets a lot of opportunities from the big tech firms in San Francisco and he’s been saying no because we still want to figure it out here.

I think that’s the most immediate stuff that we are planning to do. Current challenges on map – skills assessment. I think still in terms of social circle. So friends, family, and for me it’s also I think, the lack of work colleagues. I have a very small team here and I don’t have any HR circle here. So, from a work perspective, I do attend a lot of talks and seminars and HR meet-ups to know more people, meet up with agencies and stuff. I try to do that a lot. Friends, So we do participate a lot in these meetups with my husband’s company where we meet and go for different events but that’s about it. No so I mentioned driver’s license, that’s one of the requirements here. Right now, we don’t have one. The next sept would be to get a Drivers licence. For both of us. Were both currently allowed to drive on our Indian licenses, but we need an Australian licence. If his company applies, we will still have to pay for skills assessment. So that’s the trade-ff as well. And, because were currently not going through any migration lawyer or an agent to do this, this company will go through the lawyer who’s fees also we will have to split on top of the PR cost. I honestly think we will end up spending the same amount if we do it ourselves of if we do it through them. Of course, the difference will be that the processing time will be much lower considering it took 7 days to get the visa. Im sure the PR will be much faster and the documentation would be less.

I had to apply for a tourist visa and as well because I came here first to take that course and then went back to Chile, finished my my job for that year, resigned and then came back to study. So this initial visa was probably one week. It was fast. Yeah so I had to take the course at that time of the year which was between July and October.

Okay, so this was July to the first days of October 2016. Okay, so this was our one-week processing time. And after that, I have the student visa 1 and that was from… I think it was granted in December, January, but I got here in February. So this was February 2017 to March 2018. And then this was maybe the same… one week. They were really quick, at least at the beginning. Then from this visa, I had a bridging visa, and this was in March. I don't remember how quick this was. I remember it was very nerve wracking because I didn't know… since like, the first visa, the first student visa was over. And then I went into this bridging visa to get another tourist visa. But because I went through a process from December 2017 until until March, early March to try to get another student visa and in the end I couldn't do it. Because…Because of uni. So yeah, while I was doing the Masters, I decided that I wanted to do a PhD. So I applied while I was doing the masters. And I, I got the response that I was accepted in January. So, my research the PhD is in Education about my research is on yoga and wellbeing. So what I wanted to do I because I knew that I couldn't start the PhD until I got the fundings the scholarship, so that wouldn't happen until the second semester. So, I needed to defer the offer anyway. But I managed to save some money. So, and I wanted to do something in between. And I also… I wanted to stay because that you… Like this whole thing of coming and going, it's like it was no good. So, I… I wanted to do yoga teacher training program. But the thing is that it was tricky because according to the framework of education in Australia it was like going backwards, not forwards can guess it was from a Master's to Diploma, and not at uni, it was just an institute. But anyway, I, I gathered everything that I needed I I went to several migration agents. And the last one, they were like, really supportive. They told me this is really really rare to do. But your letter of intention is really good. Like you have a really clear case and I had the support from my supervisor as well saying that in which ways that would benefit my project. But in the end, there was one document that I needed from the university to present to immigration. And when I went to the office to talk to this person at uni to get that document, she told me that she couldn't give me the document. And and that if I intended to apply for that other course, and I defer the offer for the PhD, I was putting at risk my placement here at the uni, the PhD and I could lose it because I was like, there was like some conditions that they said that I couldn't take any course in between, before starting the PhD. So they basically told me that it was the end. So, I couldn't move along forward with my plan because I was putting at risk, what I really wanted to do and it was harder for me to get another spot for for a PhD, rather than maybe doing the training some other time, during the PhD or afterwards, so I had to change my plans. And this was like, maybe within two or three months that I had to get my head around it. Yeah, and then going into the bridging visa and then going into a tourist visa so I could stay a little bit longer. Mainly because I thought maybe I would be able to stay with a tourist visa if I like maybe stay three months here and then because usually the visas are for like one year and you have to go in and out. So I was trying to figure out how to work on that. Finally, after the bridging visa, they, they they gave me the I go to visa for not three months but two. So that was a tourist visa. And so at that time, I had a partner as well so that as well like motivated me to stay a little bit longer. So, then I stayed here as a tourist, and stayed for a conference, which was on positive education and it was linked with what I was doing. But yeah, so they they granted me a visa for less than three months, which is rare. It's really rare. Yeah. So yeah, and after that, so tourist visa, and that was from from March, I think I went into the bridging visa just for maybe one week. So maybe I think this was around two weeks, waiting. And then I got this one [tourist visa] from March until May 2018. This was two weeks. So, then I went back to Chile after the tourist visa. I had to leave. I couldn't stay anymore. So, I did the Masters with a scholarship and I'm doing the PhD with with a scholarship as well. So, because it's like, crazy expensive, so I didn't have I didn't have the scholarship at that time. So, while I was on the tourist visa, I applied for the scholarship and I got the results in late June while I was back in Chile. So basically waiting to be to hear back about the scholarship. So, when I went back home here between this visa and the visa that I'm now on that was like four months in between. And I left half of my stuff here hoping to come back again [laughs]. Took a leap of faith.  So yeah, and then the student students student visa number number two. So, this was tourist visa number one. And then tourist visa number 2. I got this be granted on August, but I couldn't get here at that time because I had to sort things out for the scholarship first. So I got here on September 2018. And I think that goes until 2023. This was maybe two weeks processing. So this was, like quick, they didn't take too long. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo tell me about the commercial services that you used in your migration journey from your first visa to your stage now.

And yeah, so I could apply… I could have applied directly to the university but they were charging a fee or something. So, and you know, like being far away it was a little bit can be daunting because like you don't know how what to do. You cant talk to anyone on the phone, you cant physically go there. So this agency it was an education Agency. They’re Australian. So it's called kangaroo. So they’re Australian but they're based in different locations. And then there's another one as well – I cant remember. So since I applied to uni through them, they helped me with everything else. So, they basically helped me complete the visa form and getting all my paperwork organized. And I had the documents already translated. So yeah, so they they are based in another city and …not in my in my hometown city. So yeah, everything like was on the phone and online. Right. So, this was for this one and then I think…yeah so they helped me with the second one. I remember taking a photo at the office like, yay we made it, “another happy student flying to Australia”. So they get paid from the Australian Government and the university. So yeah. So they helped me with this first stage and then…These one's I did it on my own. But since I had another plan here, which didn't work, so I'm just going to bracket it. So, it was going to be student visa but failed for diploma on yoga so here I got I've lost count. Like really like it was so exhausting. I went to so many different migration offices. So, I went to education agencies and migration consultants and finally, one. I cant remember the name, stellar migration I think. So, they were the ones that supported me. They read the documents, I went into the office, I had everything ready, but then the university killed that dream. So, what I finally did was this for that conference. So this was the English course. So, they they helped me with this but then since we didn't we couldn't do anything else. They supported me to apply for the other visa because this is really rare as well, going to the student visa to a tourist visa… they usually don't grant those kind of visas because they want you to just you studied, finished, move on. If you’re not studying again, like move on. So, I'm So but in the end, I actually went into the office again because this is like another story. They they were like not an education agency but a Migration Agency. And because of statistics and things like that, they didn't want to, like, charge me for the service and like, so they told me Yeah, like you can come in to the office, complete the form, like beforehand, and we can check it here and you, with your computer, submit the application. They didn't want to do it. Because if if I got the visa rejected it what it would go into their statistics and they didn't want to mess up that, But they still wanted to help me. Like, they still wanted to help me. So it was weird. But so I went into the office with my computer, and then I submitted the visa. So it is on my own. And that was the first one that I did on my own. And then in Chile this [PhD] one I did it on my on my own as well. All of these ones for from Chile except this one, this one So this was from Australia. I was happy to do it again. I just didn't want to mess it up. Yeah, yeah. So they just helped me like they read the letter. They made suggestions. Like maybe you can put these or not put this. So they gave me suggestions from from an officer, migration officer point of view. Yeah, so like, those kind of things and what documents to support, like upload and stuff like that. Yeah.

Like was it through electro example going to that agency Did somebody told you about it?', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tYeah, actually this one, I got it from a friend who got it from another friend. So I first started with education agencies, and then I ended up with a migration agent. So yeah, so this was first and then since this didn't work, I went the other way.  Before the tourist visa number one did an IELTS test. But afterwards, no, because since I already did the masters and it was within that timeframe. were like okay, I completed a higher education degree in English. I still had the I don't know but I like the language skills to go into PhD without Language Proficiency Test.  so yeah they I got an offer letter from the university conditional to the language and then this one that we saw now on like the letter that I got, it was unconditional. So it was like you're welcome to start whenever you you want but with this one year so before this… I it was like the preparation stage maybe. So the prep I I took the the TOEFL not the IELTS. I took it twice. Times two. So the first one I didn't prepare myself I just went because the dates were coming where I had to apply for uni and I just did it. So I got the score that I the overall score that I needed to apply. So the overall score was was okay. But the writing was below the required so it was 25 out of 30 and they required at least 27 so it was almost a perfect score. So, what I did then with this results, I applied for the Master of Applied Positive Psychology. So, then I applied I got the unconditional , no the conditional letter saying that I had to take the test again or doing that English bridging program. So, I took the test again and I had an overall score was much higher. So, the overall score is like 120 I had 110 something like that, but again the writing of the writing again 25 out of 30 Oh, and I and I prepared for that. So, it was insane. I didn’t understood why and because the first time the the report wasn't sent directly to uni. The second time I made sure that the report was sent directly to uni. And because I checked that box, I wasn't able to ask for review. So yeah, I was fucked up. That's another like big industry like, yeah, you make money. Like, I don't remember how much but it's probably like, at least $200 each time. And the course, I don't remember, it was quite expensive. I don't know, but maybe between maybe 2000 and $4,000. So the good thing is that within all this process, because the the, the tests were required for the university, but for the scholarship as well, to demonstrate that I had a decent level of of English to get the scholarship. So, when I when I enrolled in the English course I, I still didn't know if whether I was going to get the scholarship or not. So I again I took a leap of faith and said, Okay, I'm doing this anyway. I was very determined, and I paid from my pocket for that course. And I think it was one week before departing, that I found out that I got the scholarship. So then I got the money refunded for the course. And they covered one ticket because they want to cover a ticket to come here and then returning. There's a lot of things that that that they cover. And yeah, so great. That's why I ended up taking that course.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWas that course helpful?', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tSo Yeah, actually, It was helpful, but it was designed for people that really, like need to upskill, and I already had prepared, like my writing skills. And I was feeling really confident with that, but it wasn't reflected in the score. So, when I got here the first time I told myself okay, I'm going to take the most out of this because I'm, I asked for it and it was a big issue at the school where I was working at because I had to ask for a leave of absence for three months. And people didn't like that. So yeah, it was like so hard. So much effort put into that, that I when I arrived here, it was like okay, this course better be good and worth it and I learn something out of it. And then when I when I started, I, I realized that the group that I was in, most of the people needed a lower score. So, they, so they tried to bring you to the, to what the university requires. So, for me it was getting, like 70%. And for the rest of the course of my classmates, it was like 60%. So that the difference between, like my skill set and the skill set of the rest of the group were like, not levelled. And then I got a lot of support from from my teacher. as well. So she tried to adapt some things. And I also try to engage in other stuff so I could really make the most out of the course. But then the problem was that we didn't get enough feedback, because the course was designed like that. And it was really frustrating because I was getting my, my assignments back with nothing on them. And it was like, Yeah, good job. You got 73 Okay, but there's room for improvement or like, again, like I'm, I'm here just for this and it has cost me a lot of effort. So, I want to learn something. I need to know what to Improve and that permeated to my classmates as well. And then I found out about issues that were going on at the institute, like big issues and and then there was like a big, like, we started talking and and, yeah i'm i'm really I get…when I see unfair things going on around me I get like activated, motivated and start doing stuff and I started talking and then, at the end anyone like the..It was clear to me at the end that it was a business. So, they were failing students, just like for example, if they had to pass with a 60, they were fading them with 59 or 58 with no reason, like no proper feedback on how to improve or why they were failing. So, it was very disappointing for me and I remember questioning myself whether I had made the right choice because all over that Institute where the logos from this. University and I got like really paranoid at one point because since I was like, speaking out, and everyone wanted me to speak for them, I thought at one point like, I'm not going to get into this In the course or, or or if this is not working well, maybe the Masters is not good and like, Is it worth it? I got into that whole, like, dilemma. But anyway, then I find out that during that year, the institute had gone back independent. The uni locals were there just for for a while. So that's the story about the course. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tTell me about the role of technology in your journey from the initial stage to your current status.

So yeah here was online research mainly, like official websites from uni, mainly, um, and this was from home, my personal computer and I remember there was an open day with this university, and they had online resources like, you could talk to students. I remember Yeah. So they had I don't remember how that was called. But like online chat.  And then I got Yeah, like recommendations of which suburbs to be living, like university life. Yeah. more practical stuff. And then yeah, the official websites for the programs and things like that. Well, okay for the visas obviously you have to use the immiaccount. Social media for what I was telling you about like Facebook mainly, the Chilean group - that's another one of Latin women. The Chilean group organize… they organize a couple of events throughout the year so remember to going to a couple but I'm not really like that engaged in those groups. So, social connections so friends, family, greater community in your migration journey from initial stages to current status. So any people or any, any connections that you want to reflect on your map. So I told you about my friends here so they were actually, well, the friend that I know back from from uni, back from Chile during the preparation process. So yeah, that's my friend that was living in Melbourne. So yeah, this was key because during the preparation process, and then when I got this visa as well, I stayed with them. So, I lived with them together for for three months. Yeah and the other the other day we were talking about this. My friend went back to Chile while I was living here, and I didn't meet his partner until that time. So we were kind of getting to know each other and, and my friend left and he left us both living together and he was like, Okay, get to know each other, be friends fast, and we got along like really, really well. I remember the first day that we were alone, like we we talked for hours like getting to know each other's and yeah, like it was a really good relationship. And then yeah, so I lived with them for three months. And then I went back. So, this is like least gaps, like a lagoon, back to Chile for October, October, November, December, yeah four months. So it was like this like, hopping from here, four months there finished my job and then I realized I wanted to quit and came back - student visa. And here it was really difficult to find a place to move in by myself again and when the student visa expired again my friends appeared along the way and here again lived together for March, April, three months again. Back to Chile - again four months, four and five. So here, and then here Chile, here and here guess what again. This time, October, November, December, January, February – five months. So, they've been like key. And I have other friendships as well. But between like this movements coming back and forth, I've lost connection with some people and it really takes time and effort to reconnect with people that you didn't see over those periods of time and I made friends here but then some of them have gone away. So, it's like, I'm not really seeing anyone from this time from the English course from the map…Yes, I still have friends from the from the masters and they have been as well as a couple of them, like, really supportive along the way. And the people from from the restaurant were at work and that has been another source of support as well. That has saved my life with friends and money. I started as a volunteer but then I started working there and in times of need, It has been key. So I had a partner. So I met my partner while I was studying here. So now it’s ex partner. So I met him here. And then we kept seeing, going through the bridging, through the tourist, and when I went back to Chile, and when I got here, and then it's really messy. And here we broke up - heartbroken. Yeah. So that finished. So, I decided to go into the PhD before knowing him. Like, actually, I was on the whole process of submitting the application when I met him. So, I already like my made by my mind about that. But then he influenced me trying to stay over that period. But it wasn't, he was, wasn't the only reason why I tried to do that. It was just I let go of everything that connected me this Chile at that point - When I resigned my job, I sold my stuff, rented my apartment. So it was like, Okay, I'm releasing everything and I'm just focusing on something here. Yeah. So, but yeah, he totally influenced that process of trying to stay as well, like me trying to make sense of what I wanted to do in between, because I knew that if I… if I was going back, even in like after the first student visa ended, I was going to be in Chile, like transitioning, like no job, and as a psychologist, what what I could have done at the moment was clinical psychology, which is not very ethical to do if you don't know how long you're staying because you're making connections with your clients and you cannot like, abandon them. And I couldn't go like into another job because I knew that I was leaving. So it was kind of messy as well. It was really unstable.

And in my case, they didn't ask anything - any of those visas, none, just pay for the insurance, It was covered but it is covered by but the same thing with the - visa you have to pay from your pocket, and then they reimburse you reimburse you. so Overseas health cover 1, overseas health cover 2, and then this one, which was the most expensive one, and the scholarship just covers like, they don't pay everything at once, so they pay per year, But I have to pay it at once. For every visa I had to demonstrate that I had money basically as well as the financial. Yeah with that with like proving like I have a scholarship - This is how much I'm getting, like an allowance.

Okay, no I'm not doing that then another agency. Yeah, you can do but maybe it's better if you apply first for another masters and then go into the PhD and we happen to work with this university. So, things like that. It was really, really confusing.

I went to a workshop maybe a couple of months ago about this and and they explained these two streams…i'm not sure i think they need to go to migration agent and that's I have it in my to do list. Yeah. So I can know beforehand what's the best option but I know that with this visa, I should be able to stay the same period of time that I studied, and that would provide, like enough working experience to go into PR.

The only country that comes to my mind is Canada? Like? Yeah, like a real, like more tangible option option here because other countries are are getting as closed as Australia. yeah, like just for tourist visa right now the process is much more longer than what I did before. This is like from experience my mom coming here so, the visa took maybe three weeks to come through and it was her first visa so it should have been easier and for a friend the same thing, and they are asking, like a lot of things so if we're tourist visas, they're getting like tougher, what to expect for other visas. don't know what's going to happen. So one challenge that I didn't mention and it arised here on my current visa, and it's related to the Health Cover, insurance, So I was sick in. I got sick at the end of the beginning of April, end of March, and I had to go to hospital and the Health Cover like there this little part like you usually don't read it, or you don't think about these things on the whole process. Because I have had so many other health covers but this one, It hasn't been a year from since the Health Cover has been working for. So, so they don't automatically cover everything for health issues, and there were a lot of things that I didn't know at the time when I had to go to hospital because you're you're sick so you can't like start searching on the internet or talking to someone on the phone so I had to pay money when I when I went to the hospital. So, it is covered but since I haven't been in Australia for it's been less than a year… they, they, they use the right of assessing everything to see whether it is like a condition that pre-existence or if it's a real emergency kind of stuff. And yeah, that's it's been a long process. So, I still from April, I still haven't been refunded the whole amount of money that I paid. That's kind of been kind of stressful as well. Like, on top of being sick and getting recovered. Like this whole uncertainty of Am I going to get paid or not making phone calls, emails and everything.

But then by the time I finished school, I sort of forgot about it. I completely forgot about it. I was totally in this mindset of oh, I need to do something with my life, like a career or… and so I ended up working first and then I met 2 people, who had, they were much older. And they ended up telling me about their travel experiences and it totally clicked, and I just knew that I had to go to Australia. It’s not just they told me about Australia.

Well, umm, when I think about the first time I did this working holiday, I pretty much did this on my own, when I think about. That was all like, phone calls to the Department in Germany. I would just call these guys up, and be like okay how do I do this. Yeah, and then so, I posted this question for recommending someone and I think why I took on the recommendation of this person – I studied with someone back in Germany who’s sister is basically here and she recommended this agent. And, yeah, I felt like it’s a trusted source. And when it comes to. So, it would really make a difference because when it was the study visa it was mostly the PhD peers. I would also say that the university was really useless. I’m saying this because they need to change their thinking about their position; They want to make money, but like International students is for Australia. It’s not specifically for this university. So, university students are a source of income, but they try to withdraw from any responsibility regarding like, helping with migration process. So, and I think its not clear that its sometimes about very simple information that they can provide. I should probably put this on here. So, these were the sources that were good. But let’s also think about those that were lacking or not good. So, university’s graduate school. They are, don’t get me wrong, they are helpful in the framework they work in, but they cannot go beyond. They miss a little bit of a cross perspective sometimes. It’s a delicate topic which I understand. I am aware of this. I also understand that, yeah, I understand it’s a delicate topic. But the university needs to make a decision at some point. I mean, you are model for your students and you can’t stand up for them? So, what is it that you’re teaching to you students? You want employees? There’s no successful employees if you don’t stand up for your values. In the process, there’s always this question, is there a better way? So, I mean, in a way, I’m quite often lonely in this process because, I think social interaction is very important and I get a lot of information from that so it also makes me dependant on it, in a way, like… that’s why this consultant, the second one, is really good because she thinks beyong with me and I feel like, less dependant on the social network. Yes, I do pay money, but I also feel like. It’s a balanced thing – its like oh okay I never heard about this pathway. Its also because, people are not necessarily hiding. Its just like, umm, It’s a different thing. You pay for a consultation and a person really takes time compared to… yeah, let me relate to my question – is there a better way? I relate that to why I pay for it. Is there a better way for skilled migration? I feel like for me, personally, when it came to the study visa extension, everything was relatively smooth. Also the 485 was relatively easy because I could prove that I had the PhD. But then now when it comes to the skilled migration, I feel like, I need. So I actually have colleagues. So, we are moving on to colleagues who help me with this. It’s a little bit, like I said, like, suddenly, I know I have skills but how do I put these skills into this visa system – into the set if skills set by the visa. I am very practical about it. Im like, Okay so this is what they want to see me so what from all these skills I have, whether that’s like, in a certain training, or in a certain job – How does that translate into what their idea of what skill is. How do I translate that? Its exhausting and I also find it a bit ridiculous, but I have to overcome that, overcome my ego and just be practical and say, yeah whatever.

Because my family is back where I come from. They don’t travel. They say they don’t like flying, and I think why…that’s the exact reason why I between my first arrival and my second arrival as well here, because it was the process of saying okay I have to make a decision for my family or for myself.

The skills assessment process because theres certain features that define this skill, or this profession and I know I have the skill. I actually worked in this profession for many years. I also have experience beyond that – the defined way. But, it comes down to what the university will certify in terms of working hours and wage. So, that has a double catch because we all know we work more than we actually put on paper. So, that’s one catch and the other catch is, you know, laughs, Its not that im not willing to work more, its how much you get. Yeah, so it’s a process. Im currently in this process. Let me come back to why this first consultation was shit because at the time I was thinking… I was a bit one dimensional. I was okay, I came to Australia to do this PhD… I do this study thing and you know, that’s fine. I do have the awareness of how this migration stuff works. For me it was about living here and I didn’t have the awareness this entire like, skilled migration, politics and all that, yeah. I was naïve and arrogant at the same time, like, why wouldn’t you give me a visa, and so this person was giving me advice. Good advice would have been to say, looking at my CV you can apply for PR right now with this set of skills because this job is on the list and everything is about this list. Your whole life centres around this list. That would have been a good advice and so what happened. I was doing my PhD doing this study thing not having the awareness that I actually, sort of, lose. Of course, I don’t lose, but on paper I sort of lose the experience that I had working for several years in a relatively good position and at the university in Germany. Maybe I should have said, how can I get PR. I was just asking for migration advice and this person; just gave dumb advice I already knew.

Maybe theres someone who’s more up to date. Yes, I would always help or advise or even when it comes to things like, do you know any migration agent…', '', '', '', 'M:\\tFuture plans?', '', '', 'Cl:\\tSo feels like, yeah when I look at this maps, it feels like, I could have done this PR already and for some reason I’m doing alllllll this stuff. I feel like I’m doing a big turn. So, at the moment, I’m waiting, So I wanna get my… I identified the visa with the help of one of my peers – it’s the skill actually. that I wanna apply for… and I need to get my skills assessed. For that I contacted Vetassess. So various documents ofcourse – My key document, lets just the key ones, not silly ones where you have to show that you did the PhD and all – that’s fine. But, key document would be – okay so I called up Vetassess. For me the question was do they assess the skills or do they assess that I have this title, and they said it’s the skills. I need to show that I have the skills. They said the title doesn’t matter. So the key document would be, demonstrate skills So on the website which says so like, x, y, z skills to show. So Im very practical in my approach so Im like tick tick, yes I have this, no don’t have this. So when I say, I don’t have this, can I maybe show it? Is there something that I am not thinking about that can be shown. So my place, is about ‘University lecturer’ and they have stuff like, you know, sparks class discussion. Of course I’m doing that. Of course, Im holding seminars, I’m attending workshops. So, my key document is – at the university is called ‘statement on service’. On Friday I sent to my employer everything I did at the university and its various jobs. I did for 1 year I did advising for students at all levels, on various questions. Then of course, tutoring. Then of course, there’s a catch to it. The catch is that – so I did PhD research – but they want to see, and I’m not sure how to show that. So, they’re saying a PhD is not a research position that counts for the skill of university lecturers but to say that you’re a university lecturer you need to show that you are doing research. So how can I bring that? So, I need to see how to do that. I think its quite interesting to say that I have a degree which is called Doctor of Philosophy but that’s not a research, like doesn’t demonstrate research skills. So, that’s what I mean by.. you know, needing to understand their understanding of how they see it. I mean at the moment, one thing was, I was paid to help writing for an award application so I will bring this in. I will bring in that yeah I am writing publications from my own research. I’m peer reviewing in journals. So, I tried to get the documentation that I’m doing that. So, what it is is really to, out of, sort of, its like a puzzle. I need to bring in for them, my, sort of, puzzled life as a university lecturer – bring it together and be like -  this is what I’m doing. I’m also going to bring in my, I really have management position from the president’s office for 3 years in Germany so its not, I’m not a 25 year old PhD student or something, nothing against 25 yo.

This person was actually mis-guiding me a couple of years ago. But I think I wish I had consulted someone who had the awareness to say hey, are you actually aware that you could already apply for PR. Although, I have to say, to be fair I would’ve lost my scholarship as an international student. So I would have to wait for 3 years to not lose my scholarship. I had to remain an international student. I mean I just want to add that I never really considered myself a migrant which might sound a bit silly because I feel like I belong here.

We were born and raised in China and we coming from the same province – the middle part of China, but different cities. Our family, ancestry is long history. I come from a big family. My grandparents, they were scholars. They were like educated but my dad, he didn’t, because of the history reasons in China, because of peace generation, he didn’t went for, you know, formal education. My mom is the same. And yeah, I think in general the whole fanily, my grandparents generation – even though I was little but I can tell the difference of their impact on our generation. Not on my father’s generation but our generation. What kind of my brother and I – we look for formal education, we want to learn more. My husband is a different story. His dads side is, his dad is a construction worker or manager in some period and his mom coming from a different family background. His family is like, so complicated, I didn’t like that. Like, his parents was always fighting, like I didn’t know that before we were dating or after we were dating for so long to meet his parents. Yeah, anyway, it’s a long story. Furthermore, to the grandparents generation, I think his dads side were very rich. Moms side was quite poor. Like, exactly like my family background. So, maybe that’s a historical coincidence.

And I think once they move dto this mountain area, I think my dads family, they bought all the land. So, they will settle down in there. But my grandparents generation, they were like super rich and I think they were like, travelling around, yeah but my dad didn’t tell us stories about their generation.

But yeah, anyway, we met through students union doing all this kind of crazy students work.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tProfessional background?', '', '', '', 'Ju:\\tI think, its really hard to say. So, I studied English, the language, as my Bachelor degree and then I did some work as a interpreter and translator and then I found a specific area for migration to have foreigners – we call expatriates to China to work, mainly to work. So then, I worked in that area called relocation and migration services, I think for roughly 5 years, before I came to Australia. And now I am doing PhD studies in Migration studies. We can say its consistent, I am still using my professional knowledge about how expatriates migrate and how they adopt to workplace and manage the work-life balance, things like that. All the ideas are coming from that professional background. I think if you look at it that way, I think, I am still using my professional knowledge to this. But at some point, I think this move beyond that as well because at that time it mainly focused at the law, the legal background, the legal regulations in China but now I am moving to another direction – to research the experience. So, in that sense, it’s not so much related to my professional training or professional experience, I think. So I come here in 2015. I think I still worked for the China company for about a year or so We just doing remote – like – working from home from over here. And then, at that time I was pregnant and then I had a leave, a break, a very short break and then I started uni over here and I did my Masters over here and then just go further. I didn’t go for workplace job or something. At that time, I just thought, if I want to change my lifestyle, I may start it from way of thinking. Probably that was wrong. I should just go find a job or do something else and be happy. Laughs. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHow long did you plan/consider the move?', '', '', '', 'Ju:\\tI thnk the idea was probably in our mind roughly for 2 years. It was quite difficult for my husband to make the decision. He was, still is, the only child in his family and he never really got this idea to live so far away from his family. I was the opposite. I was, I travelled a lot within China and I always wanted to find out whats new and have new experiences. So, I kind of persuade him to try different things. So coming to Australia, like, actually, like, when it came to my mind, I said to him that if you don’t want to go, I will go by myself. So, you know, he said, like we are a couple, so we are supposed to be together. So, he said okay – lets do this. So then, after we had a serious talk, I started to do IELTS and then he did IELTS as well. But its just, everything on paperwork, seems to be so good for me. Not until we come we realised that I couldn’t carry on the same profession because of the different regulations of being a migration agent over here. So, that was quite challenging for me actually. But he, he was, he had a small company back in China and he has all this business background and our friends over here offered him a job right away so bingo – and we stayed. We come as business visa and then he was offered a job, and then we start to talk to migration agent, and then, and looking to what kind of visa we can do. But, that’s where the difficulty started. Apparently, its Marketing something – at that time, they need to do a skills assessment something, and he couldn’t pass that and then we thought about other options. So that company hire me as well but because of my professional background, they couldn’t hire me for the regulations even though I have all the knowledge of marketing, sales… I have the experience but it’s just the industry doesn’t fit. I worked for the consultancy company before so I have all this kind of skills. The migration consultancy – and I have management skills because I literally built a team from only myself to 6 people by the time I left the company only in 3 years. I have marketing skills, I basically marketing our migration service, and relocation service, like a lot. And I know, I have sales experience as well, prior to this migration consultancy, I did sales for pad company and steel company as well. I was quite successful in each job. It’s just when we come here, they say no – you cannot just say you have that, and it doesn’t count. I have a degree in English language and then they were saying you have a degree in English Language, and you did marketing and sales and the you did migration consultancy – that’s all migration and that’s a specific industry which doesn’t fit over here. So, we talked so many different options. Its just – nothing works. So, I said, well, okay maybe this is a time to do my Masters because I always wanted to do a Masters. It sounds like the only right move, and also because I was pregnant and yeah.. and now we start to look for student visa and we realised if my husband needs a full-time job, I need to do a Research degree. So, here I am. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tResearch on visa options', '', '', '', 'Ju:\\tOh, we didn’t conduct any research or anything on that. Actually its just, we said, to over friends here we want to come to Australia and have a look. Do you want to.. Can you like, invite us? So they sent us an invitation letter saying you know, because we did business before, and we invited them to come over to have a look. Yeah, so we used that letter to apply.

But they had no capacity to help us but they just simply believe that everything I do is right. My brother never concerned anything about my life or work. So, my family, I don’t think they helped or resist I any way. My husband’s family was actually like a push force for us to come because his mom simply like push us to buy a house, have children. I think that’s a last draw on my husbands shoulder to push us to move further , to move far away. For me, I think, I just wanted to maybe change, I just wanted to move away to another city just within China, eventually. And then, yeah, but his mom and dad divorced by that time and that was hard time, like, his mom was super depressed, and she lived with us and she had a really negative effect on me. I think my husband saw that even though I have a really good relationship with my mother in law but she affect me like, mentally, psychologically. And I wasn’t happy. Like, I worked super hard. So my husband barely saw me at home. So I always go early to work and come back like, 9 or 10 at night so yeah, but I don’t know. Maybe that’s a good thing or not. And then, another thing was that she found a partner before we moved. I think she moved to living with him few months before we actually decided we wanted to come because my husband, you know, somebody is looking after her and she seems to be happy. Yeah, so it seems like, her life actually, was big part of my husbands consideration, whether, you know, to move away or not to move away even though at the beginning, like I said earlier, we have 2 years in considering to move but he never actually make up his mind to go but that’s the thing. She moved away and she moved away with her life - find a partner, get a job and they were happy so that means that we can actually have our life. But we didn’t like Shanghai.

And other friends I don’t think we have a lot of friends for networking, or Im not a big fan of social media and FB was banned in China. And, yeah, they are, not so many platforms were available to us to get information. We have education agents in China but they always charge you money to give information which I don’t believe as well and yeah, for us we just thought we have to come to Australia to have a look and search the information by ourselves and also because we speak the language we are so confident we are going to survive here by all means.We have couple of business clients – so before we come here, my husband was doing business with them.

But before we do that, actually I was always thought I may go for further education so I did other process like notarising our degrees, translate that, get them officially transcribed, translate into English and notarise that. We did our ielts test. – that was not required but I prepared that anyway as a just, you know, just, out of my professional experience, you know, that we may need other options and they may request this kind of documentation and if we come to Australia nobody in China has the capacity to help us to do that kind of thing. We even notarise our marriage certificate, our birth certificates. You know everything I can think of as a professional migration consultant, I prepared it.

We did IELTS twice for me. My husband did twice as well. We did medical check I think, twice. So students visa – business visa we paid application. So for 2 of us, I think it cost us 2500 rnb so thats $500AUD. And IELTS – in China it was more expensive – I think 400 something in China –  $350. Medical check, so twice for me and then plus Joy. For family its more expensive. I think it cost us for 2 of us – mine was 600 something – we used BUPA, it was quite expensive 600 + 2 + 3 and this is the most expensive one – employer. So student visa we paid $500, employer nomination we paid $2000 and our employer paid $6000 for the training fees, and then student visa – so these two I think is nearly 600. And then here its 600 as well. The good thing for research student is that husband and dependent – they are free so that’s $600 as well. Oh insurance money – that’s the biggest amount and tuition fees. So insurance for the first one for 3 years, I think we paid $15k as a family. Its insane. But now we are paying more. So, for PhD we paid 20000 – insane right.And then tuition fee – Masters - $25000 and then second year its half – I was lucky. Luckily for PhD the tuition fee was waived and we got the scholarship and cover for 1 persons insurance. Childcare – so Joy attending childcare since she was 10 months old. So, now shes 3.5. I think the first year I think its only 10-12 so that’s 1 year old. I think 2000 something. 2nd and 3rd and (roughly per year) – for childcare the same amount as my tuition fee. Its that much. So, every penny we earned, its back in Australia. So we checked our bank account actually. If we look exactly now back to 4 years ago, we have the same saving. So 4 years passed, we spent all the money we earn here and the savings were all gone in between. This savings which is saved gradually, a little bit by the time. That’s insane right!?

I only look at his registration number to look at whether he is a legal registered agent. That’s the only think I looked at. That was a huge mistake. So, looking back I think I should use those kind of networks more wisely. Actually, I think there bare some Chinese migration forums online – I don’t remember what they are called. I think tick tak world visa. I used this type of websites to check some requirements when I was free before I come here. But I think very limited. That’s a mistake. I should use that more wisely, definitely and do my research.Currently I didn’t do any research at all. I just go, you know, I finish my study and then I would do everything by myself thoroughly and prepare that. I know its that – maybe it’s a mistake as well. Maybe we should think about migration from now as a starting point because it takes time and its constantly changing. I don’t know. Its just that I don’t have time for that. Its more concerning of psychological, emotional management than time consuming actually. I think if I squeeze the time to do research, maybe I can do that.

We can see whats wrong in there but our friends, our family sitting there – they couldnt see it. That was kind of our motivation to stay here. I just feel like they were driving by – not social media – by the media, by politics, by everything in this huge bubble but they were so much in it, they couldn’t see that.

I was like oh, that was like, I wasn’t prepared for it… I wasn’t ready because after getting so many rejections, I was like not expecting that I will get it. But anyways, so then I thought about it for 3 days to decide whether I will take it because I never wanted to go to Australia. I don’t know why. Just because I thought maybe geographically it is too far and Canada – I have other expectations or an image about the education system there compared to Australia. Anyway, I decided, because I didn’t have any other opportunities and I had to do my PhD.

And within a few minutes she refined my proposal, and transformed my idea into a working proposal and she was like yes you can apply here but I am not sure about funding.

It requires So do you have to submit your degrees your transcripts to a Canadian assessment authority? Yeah, something like that. That’s called world education system so they assess your degree and and make a report if equivalency if your masters it is equivalent to Canada's masters or not, and they just generate that report and for immigration we need that report.

But then, I mean, of course, I didn't talk to my family. So yeah, what I did was because I've also developed some friends here, I have developed some connections… that was through that accommodation finding thing. So I have a friend whom I met in Italy, he connected me with her friend who was doing PhD in Melbourne Uni. So she contacted me and she said, I'm leaving this place. If you want to have this and you can, you can. So, then she also shared some other accommodation options to me. And then I end up meeting an Indian woman who is from Brisbane and her brothers houses here near to the uni’s side. I went to her she was very nice to me and I sort of like connected you know, I felt like oh, I mean, okay, there are people who are very caring, who were very loving. So that was the only time I met her and then we were connected through Facebook and that's it. And then I met her last week as well. And I shared that I'm applying to Canada and I don't know what to do. I mean, I don't have money. I was considering to apply for a loan here. Or I was I didn't know why I never used a credit card. So I was like if I can apply for credit card because she also works for the bank. So she explained everything to me that I may not be eligible for credit card because credit card is only for purchases. If you want to have the other credit card to give you cash, then you need to be either permanent resident or some something else. I was like, Oh, damn, but she offered me that I can give you some money if you just needed to keep it in your bank account. I was like, Oh my god, you saved us… I was like, I mean, I'm so relieved. But still, I mean, even if even after adding her money, I was still, I didn't have enough. So I mean, that day, my another friend who who is doing masters here and she came to my office randomly because we had planned for dinner. So she was she asked me what happened. You look so stressed. I said, I'm and this is the issue I'm having. Without any, you know, expectation…I just shared that this is… this is what's going on in my life. She said, I have money I can give you. Why didn't you ask me? I said, I mean, I never thought about it. I was like, I mean, why why anyone would give me money? I mean, you need I mean, of course, I mean, first you have to have that trust thing, then of course you will transfer money in someone's account. So, she said, No, you can have it because I have this much amount and I'll just pay my fees. I mean, and even then I have sufficient amount. So, if you need it for three, four months, you can have it. So, I was like, Oh my god, I never asked people. I have this kind of thing that I don't ask people that I need help. So yeah, then she helped me. And then, now, my funds are sufficient enough. Yeah. But that entire week was very stressful that I didn't know what I'm going to do. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tDo you need to have this bank statement for a certain amount of they need to see that this money has been sitting in your account sometime?

If you just take out the money out straight away, that's fine. But once they start the process, they might ask you to submit a fresh statement because they need just a statement a piece of paper, they are not looking into your accounts. I mean, yeah, online and stuff. So, but when they ask to submit it again, then it might create issue for you. So therefore, it's better to leave it in the aacount for two or three months or until your application is finalized. \", '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd then what about other things? other documentation?

So, I don't know if it really is but I mean, this is how they're convincing people to pay up front. Yeah. Which is $1100 dollars. It's a money game. So I have to pay that as well this is something that you pay when submit your all documents, right okay, so since I was gathering all the documents for example my police check, my IELTS, then my medical and then my experience letters - I had to call my previous employers requesting them please… For God's sake For God's sake, give me my experience letter, my reference letter but on these formats, so yeah, it also took like two to three weeks and I still haven't got one from one of them so I have to just write to them today that please for God’s sake.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo when we were discussing this stuff about Canada now, yeah.

So, I had to pay for it again. Then I had to practice because I thought, okay, I didn't practice last time. I was like over, you know, I thought, Oh, I know everything. So now I should spend some time in practicing. And yeah, and spent another 350 dollars in going to the city from here and taking the test and yeah, that was one thing which which I find stressful emotionally because then the whole period of those five days when I was waiting for my result, every night I was like Oh What if I, if I didn't get the desired results of this time then do I have to apply again? I was like very upset with it. And then I mean, thankfully I cleared. So then I was relieved but then the next hurdle was this statement things.

But yeah, next time I was like, the same scoring but some, you know, improvement in writing. That’s it. My priority was PhD and not immigration. So and I was in the phase of getting admission somewhere. So, and I got it. So I thought why to lose this opportunity and apply for PR.. I don't know if Ill get it or not, but something which I have, tangible - So there is no I mean logic to let it go. So therefore, I chose Australia for PhD. And after I mean, I know that after doing this PhD, I don't want to go back to Pakistan. So that's why I started thinking about applying to immigration and Canada, I mean, because I didn't explore anything about Australia and Canada is something where my husband's family is.

So therefore, we decided that we need to go to a developed country which offers citizenship. Because Yeah, otherwise, I mean, there's no future in Middle East. So, having a different passport is a powerful thing now in especially coming from a country which has a very bad history and negative, you know, in association with this country, so therefore it's important to change the passport.

In this scared, closed, introverted environment where the girls are not allowed to express.

So, I realised that here in Australia, doing a PhD – the government finds it. Whereas, in the UK you need to get like, a student loan and I didn’t want to commit to a loan so – that’s actually the most important reason as to why I migrated to Australia. I wanted to get my PhD. That’s the most important thing. I migrated to UK as a student even though my mom is a citizen there but in UK you need to have gotten in.. or moved down before you were 18. After 18 it becomes a lot difficult. So, I had to apply as a student. But after the student visa, I waited further to get my indefinite leave to stay there forever. But, when I realised that coming to Australia, I’m able to do my PhD for free, I decided to move. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhen did you move to the UK?', '', '', '', 'O:\\t2006. So from 2006, my BSc, I think I finished in 2009, and I did my Masters. I finished in 2010. Then, 2011 2012, I worked a little bit with British Telecom in the UK and that’s when I got the world bank job. So, I moved back to Nigeria because the project was focused on in Nigeria and Kenya. So, I moved down there. So, I was working on the project coz it was funded by the world bank and CFI. CFI is the – they provide aids to African countries on behalf of the British government so I was actually moving from Nigeria to UK but I was actually working closely with Nigeria. So yea, from 2012 to 2015, no 16, I was pretty much in Nigeria. Then I moved back to UK. I did some work but before then, prior to then, I think around 2013, that was when I actually got my PR for Australia. So, because my wife, she actually studied here at The university of Queensland. That’s where she finished. But when she finished reading there, she went back to Nigeria. So, she was the one who told me how beautiful Melbourne was, and I decided to give it a try. So, 2013, that is when I actually applied for the PR, the 189 visa, and I got it in 2013 but they give you 5 years basically, to prepare your properties to sell, etc. After I got it, I came to Melbourne just for like, 2 weeks, just to see whether I liked it and I did. So, I went back to Nigeria then continued my World bank job. Then 2018 – that was when the 5 year period that they gave me was going to expire. So, I decided to move. I think I actually entered Australia 2 days before it was going to expire, and the guy looked at me at the border and was like, “did you actually wait 5 years”. I was like well!!

So, I was more or less managing the IT intervention. With the WB role, they had different interventions and each of the intervention, they used different IT companies. So, I was like, the IT manager. Even though I do a little bit of Business Analysis – I try to map the processes from A to Z. But I also liked the product owner, the whole signing off any development. I was pretty much the IT manager and also the Business Analyst. That’s always been what I have been doing. So, when I moved down to Australia, the first place where I worked was a government agency in Victoria. It was pretty much similar to what I was doing in Nigeria. What they do in Film Victoria is that they support people from the entertainment industry and the games industry. You submit an idea. You submit online, and if its good enough, the Victorian government will give you money. So, the idea is to bring the movies you wanna shoot, you bring it Victoria. That way, they can create jobs, they give you incentives to bring your productions down to Australia. That way, you give people jobs and train people how to shoot movies, and how you do all these things.  So, it was pretty much similar to what I was doing in Africa where the wold bank supports the business plan. If its good enough, they give you the grant to support your business.

She’s just waiting for her visa to come through. She’s on the, coz I’m on the indefinite leave, she’s on that too. It’s like the permanent residence, but it’s not like the PR, like you can stay in the UK for ever, and after a while you can apply for a citizenship.

I don’t know about now but then, if you school was amongst the top 400 you get extra 5 points. So, yeah, it’s all about information. I went to University Essex and it was in the top so I got additional 5 points for that. I did all the calculations. I needed 65 points. So, I got the 65 points but for you to get nominated – it is based on the number of your points – the higher, the better. So, I said to myself, ah, maybe I just should go and do IELTS coz if I do IELTS, and I pass it, I can get up to 20 PR 10 points. So, the thing is, because Nigeria, we are English speaking and maybe because I was in the UK, I didn’t need it. Coz, I remember I actually asked, and they said I didn’t need it. I don’t know. Again, that’s the question – who needs IELTS? I just know I didn’t need it. I just did it coz I could add more points. I actually did it twice, so crazy!. So basically, you can’t score below 7 in each band. The first time I scored 8 in each band and I scored 6.5 in the listening and that invalidates you.

If I’m tired of Sydney, I can decide to go to Canberra. So, I didn’t like the thought of staying somewhere for 2 years. What if I can’t find a job where I am that I like?

So busy, and everyone is working, and you have to move fast. I didn’t like that vibe. That’s why I got tired of the UK. It was too fast for me. It’s like Nigeria in Lagos, everything is so fast. You need to be street-wise, you need to be so sharp and I don’t like that. I like Melbourne – its relaxed, its laid back. So yeah, I just decided I’ll stay in Melbourne. But its changing. I was telling my friend that when I came in 2014 – it was so calm and I was like “oh I love this place” and when I came in 2018, I’m like, “really! Whats going on here, It’s so busy”.

In Nigeria we have this one-year national youth service. It’s called NYSE. So, basically you serve your country for a year. If you graduate before the age of 40, you need to serve the country. So, the whole idea is to find a way to integrate everyone. So they, if you’re like, from the West – I’m from the West – Lagos, they send you to another region of the country. So, that way you try to understand the cultures, and you get to integrate. It is good but I think that because they want to encourage foreign students so when you come, they give you the liberty to choose where you wanna go. When I went, I just decided that I was gonna choose Abuja. Abuja is the central capital. Its mandatory. Like, for example, the world bank job that I did, I wouldn’t be able to do that if I had not done the NYSE. You must have it. As long as you graduated before the age of 40, you must do the NYSE, else, you can’t hold a position in Nigeria. We do military training for 3 weeks out of the 1 year. Sometimes, they post you at a school – you get to teach people, do ICT stuff, they can post you to hospitals, to banks. So, they can post you anywhere for work for rest 11 months. But, for 1 month you do para-military training. I went back to Nigeria for the youth service. So, 2012, I finished it in 2012 and I went back to UK. I was working with British Telecom. I worked there for 2 years till 2014, and I went back to Nigeria. So, 2014, I went back to Nigeria. So, I applied for  - so, 2013 – that was when I applied for my PR. So, I think that should come first. So, that’s when I applied for it. So, after I got the PR, I still went back to Nigeria. So, 2014-2018, I was working the world bank job in Nigeria. I was moving to London as well, but mostly based in Nigeria.

So, I submitted the documents to ACS. I paid the fees. I think I got the result in about 3 weeks to a month. So, after that, I submitted an EOI to immigration, and after I submitted it – after like 3 weeks after that I got an invite. Then I did IELTS. I got the result after 2 weeks.

', '', '', '', 'M:\\tCommercial services', '', '', '', 'O:\\tI only used agent – I only spoke to lawyer when I wanted to apply for my wife. I wanted to understand how the partner visa works. When I read on the forums that its very complicated, so I wanted to get as much information as possible. So, I spoke to a lawyer about okay what’s the process for bringing my wife over to Australia. Basically, I already knew the process because I did my research, but I wanted to see if there’s any faster approach to get my wife over. I know you can apply, and it takes 14-19 months, but I thought there should be another way to do it. Unfortunately, now I know that that was one of my biggest mistakes. If I had known that I would have just stuck to my online research because the agent – well – she was gonna do the application for me and she was gonna charge like, $3000 or $4000. She’s actually based in Sydney. When I told her, oh actually I’m a graduate, I can read, I did my PR myself, I can do it myself. So, rather than speaking $3000-4000, I can do it myself. So, she wasn’t very happy about it. So, she probably didn’t give me as much information as she should have given me. For example, when I was concerned that now I am waiting for that 14 months to 19 months, is there any way to bring my wife to come join me temporarily?, and everyone I spoke to – were like, the fact that you’ve applied for her, the partner visa, if you now apply for a visitor visa, the immigration will know that you want this woman to just come and meet you cox they’ll see that application and most likely will reject it. So, then like, mostly what agents advise before was that she should apply for the visitor visa first. When she’s in the country, you apply for the partner visa. That way, she goes into the bridging. The agent I spoke to, the lawyer, she didn’t tell me any of this. I applied last year August so it’s going to be one year. I paid the lawyer for the consultation. I paid $200 for one hour. We have to go to the court to certify all my documents. I also paid to the ACS – I think I paid about $400 to validate my degree. I paid for police reports – I needed from both the UK and Nigeria. Let’s just say 100 pounds. Let’s just say $30 for documents certification. IELTS was like $150 each so $300 for IELTS. Medical was roughly about $200. And then my wife and child had to do this – yeah yeah. In fact, that is what is getting me. Currently, we did the medical and the document certification, and the police report, and I read online that sometimes it only lasts for 12 months. That means, we’ll have to do it again. Coz she, she’s a diplomat, and ambassador. So, she actually stayed in Pakistan, in Islamabad. So, she went through a lot to actually get the police report. She just got it, actually, just last month. So, it took her about 5-6 months to get it. So, when I read online about 12 months, to actually go through that process again, I’m worried – I don’t even wanna think about that, to get that Pakistan one. I mean, the Nigerian and UK were were okay. But the Pakistan one, I don’t wanna go through it again. Yes. So, her degree was actually, between Pakistan and Australia. So, she did 2 years in Pakistan and the third year in Australia. So, I think it was a joint collaboration between the university in Pakistan and the university in Australia. She did IELTS as well because I remember she was bragging that she scored better than me. My daughter also had to do the medicals. She’s 4. Probably I spend about $400 for medical for both of them. What about the fees for the spouse visa? That’s the biggest one. It was $7600. I paid like, $9000 something for my daughter and wife – that’s what I paid. I was like what! I was thinking it was better she applied while I was still in Nigeria. But, most of my friends said it would be difficult because they expect you as a sponsor, to be in Australia, to have settled down. So, that was why we did it this way. The five years that were waiting, maybe we should have done it. But it would have been very difficult. Then I travelled back to UK and Nigeria to go see them because I was missing them. And I’m still thinking of visiting them this year in Christmas as well. That’s expenses – that’s part of it. It’s a lot. It’s not easy.  I think it’s about $2000 for every return journey. I had to pay for biometrics. But that wasn’t expensive. That was like $150. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tTechnology', '', '', '', 'O:\\tI used two online blogs – Nairaland – it is very popular in Nigeria. I also used British Expats. So, both of them are like blogs. So, people share ideas on their journeys, their timeline. How they applied for their visa, you know, just the journey they went through to get their visa. Those 2 blogs were the 2 that I used extensively. I’m actually still active on Naira land. Now I tend to give advice to people. So, now I tell people, hey if you’re married, put your wife on your application. Now, I’m actually active. I don’t know much about other visa’s but now I do know about the 189 PR route. Its one forum but there are different threads. So, there’s a thread for Canada, there a thread for America, there’s one for Australia. So, I only post on the Australia one. Even the UK, I don’t know much because when I did the student visa, I was young. The Australia one, I did myself. The UK one, my mom, my dad, they did the application for me. Apart from Nairaland, now there’s a WhatsApp group. So, those of them who moved from Nigeria to Australia, and used Nairaland, so theres a WhatsApp group. We all chat about the experiences and all that. But, it’s strictly for those who have been successful in their journey to discuss experiences of moving, finding work and so on. It was actually from there that I learnt that I should have actually applied for the partner. There are some people on the group who are actually migration agents, but I didn’t know that. So, they were the ones that were telling me, Oh the agent you spoke to didn’t do justice. They help you to get cheap houses once you’re in Australia, how to get cheap cars. I think it’s a closed group. And, its about 150 users. It is invite only. So, once you tell them that you came from Nairaland, they ask you for your name on Naira Land. Everyone has a unique name on Naira Land. So, they’re going to check you out to see that truly you used to comment on the thread, and from there they will add you to the group. I never met anyone from the group physically. The first person I met was just 3 days ago. He is here for like 3 or 4 years, but he’s been finding it difficult to get a job. So, I told him that I’m lucky, I’ve not only been here 3 years and I’ve already changed jobs twice. So, I was telling him maybe you can do you CV differently. It’s more like a data science CV but I think right now, a lot of people are looking for BA, BI. I just tried to help him do his CV to get a job. So he’s the only person I actually met. Mostly, we just communicate online.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tGetting a job. ', '', '', '', 'O:\\tWhen I got here in April, I was lucky, maybe because I was in a strategic position where I was working at. So, they actually allowed me to work remotely. So, even when I was in Australia, I was still working for the World bank project. So, I didn’t need to get a job. I told my wife that I’m just gonna finish the project… Its gonna be different because of the time zones and all. When its morning in Australia its night in Nigeria. So, I was like, I’m gonna be working 24 hours. So, for the first 2 months, I don’t even wanna work in Australia. I’m just gonna focus on my project and apply for my DL, get an apartment, you know, just settle in. So, for the first 2 months I didn’t really apply for any jobs. I was just doing the work I had. So, at some point, I started getting a bit bored. Yeah, when I moved here, one of my friends, that someone introduced me to. He was staying in Point cook. So, I stayed in his house for 2-3 months before I got my apartment. So, even though I said I wasn’t gonna apply for a job, but you know in the morning, he was living with his wife, so they both go to their workplace and I’m the only one who’s home. And I was like, uhh, even though I was working on the project, it was just so boring.  So, after about 2 months, I started applying. It was too boring for me – this is gonna kill me. So, I started learning some things. I was getting these rejection emails – oh sorry, we found a better candidate bla bla bla. I was like, I’m very qualified, like, whats happening. I realised that a lot of these companies, if you don’t have local experience, it’s difficult to get a job and I don’t like it because IT is a general language. Whether, it is in India, Pakistan, Nigeria – it is the same code. So, I just, I didn’t understand the whole rationale behind local experience. So as I was doing that, I saw this ad for this charity, they work for vulnerable women and children who are exposed to domestic violence. So, they try to teach them how to defend themselves – so self-awareness and self-defence classes. So, you come to them and then they assess you and realise oh you have issues, they out you through to some self-defence classes to boost your self-confidence. And so, I saw the ad online that they were looking for research analyst. So, I sent my CV to her and she liked it. She called me for an interview, and I got it. So that actually kept me engaged for that period while I was home. I advised them how can do things differently, for example they can have a website where people can fill a form, have a social media handle, people can always reach you online rather than come to your physical office. So, I did a lot of research and also helped them define the process. I’m actually still doing it. It’s a pro bono thing so whenever they need my service, I try to help them. I actually got my first job in 3 months and this volunteer work helped coz even when I went for my interview for the government job, I was one the top and it came down to my references. So, I gave them a reference from my World Bank job and mostly Nigeria and UK and they were like, no we need an Australian reference. I’m like, you saw in my CV, I never worked in Australia, how can I give you an Australian reference. So the guy was like, see, he liked me, I was a top applicant, so he said even if it’s a friend. So, I then realised that I can ask the lady from the charity work I am doing. So, she said yes, shes gonna be my reference. So they used her and one of my UK references.

So, when I got here, like I told you, I was getting a lot of rejection letters. So, I read online that sometimes you just go on LinkedIn and if you see someone, if you either worked together or went to the same university, you can just send a message to the person, chat with them and maybe have a coffee, try to see if they have an opening in their office and ask them to be a referral. So, I actually did that. The first person I met – I saw an opening in Commonwealth bank. They guy was from Nigeria and worked in Commbank so I was like hey bro, whats up man, can you just be a referral, and he said no he can’t do that. I was like why, and he was like coz he doesn’t know me. I was like, hey it’s not a reference, its just a referral – like you’re the one telling me to apply for this job. He said, yeah, he doesn’t feel comfortable. I was surprised, I was really really disappointed. But anyway, I actually met another guy. He’s a consultant. Hes a Nigerian – hes into ML. I saw him on Social media, and I messaged him and he was like yeah, come meet me for a coffee. So, I sat down with him and he just told me, like oh, the way you did your CV, it’s too – like in Australia, they wanna see your acheivements, like, whatever you have achieved. My CV was just like I worked there, this is what I did. So, I didn’t have a proper CV. So, while we were having this discussion, he realised that I was very good with some of the tools that they currently used in Australia – like CRM, tableau, but on my CV it wasn’t there. So, he was like you need to put all that on your CV, they like to see all that stuff here. So, I had to redo my CV and I ensured that I listed all those things, and yeah I got the job. So, social media mostly helped me after I moved here. You know, I always tell people that, information is the most important thing that anyone can have. You know why? You know when I moved down to Melbourne, I didn’t buy a car. It was only me so I was always jumping on the bus. And at some point I was like, my wife and my daughter will join me so I should just get a car. It took me about 6-7 months to get a car and the only reason was, I didn’t want to go through doing the driving test, and all that. I know I can drive. The guy I stayed with when I moved here told me that I need to do my driving test and all that. So, one day, I was just browsing online, and I realised that if you have a UK license, just take it there they can just swap it. Just that. I didn’t know that because the guy told me I have to go through the whole driving test. And I was like oh, I don’t wanna do that. I just wanna focus on my job, on my life, bring my family down. I don’t wanna go through this driving test. I can always just on the bus or tram and you know the funny thing, that this guy – so initially I thought oh maybe he doesn’t know this because he’s never been to the UK. But, his wife is actually American, so he told her the same thing. So, I took my UK licence and they swapped it, and gave me the Australian license. And I called him and said listen man, don’t tell your wife to go. And he was still arguing with me that No! that’s not possible. I just told him I just did it. He was telling me that he’s been living in Australia for 10 years and he knows. So, then the wife called me, and I told her that just pay the application fee, and they will change it. So, it was then I realised that information is very important. Sometimes, don’t just listen to what other people say, even if the person has been here for 10 years.

I mean, if theres, let me tell you something. I think about 2 months ago I sent an email to the MP – the local MP and like, how can you keep a family away for 2 years – a partner? That is breaking the whole family itself. What is the purpose of it. They were like, they look at it to validate if the marriage is genuine because theres a lot of scam. I was like, yeah but like, honestly, I’m talking to here one-on-one. Theres some arguments I am having with my wife and when I was in the UK and Nigeria with her, I didn’t have these arguments in her. But now, because of this visa theres a lot of frustration, like shes the only one taking care of the child, shes so tired coz she needs to work, shes got her own business – she does cupcakes, she takes the child to school, she works, does the housework, sometimes these little, little things, we have started arguing about it. When I was with her, we never argued so much. So, it actually causes a lot of triggers on small things, and I don’t understand why these guys don’t think about that. You are actually breaking a family with all these checks – youre breaking my family. For me, that is the part which is not fair, its not right. If I had known, honestly, that it was gonna be this difficult, I probably wouldn’t have moved to Australia. I would have just stayed in the UK. Why would I not want to stay with my family, my daughter, she’s just 3 years old. Its torture. I understand like yeah, okay maybe there’s a lot of scam going on, or things like arranged marriages, I understand. But, you cant punish genuine people. No matter what you tell me, when you keep families, especially newly married or young couple away fro so long, there is no way you are not breaking, like somehow, you are breaking their relationship. You are breaking the bond. You end up saying things to each other, yeah you’re angry but you still said it. And for me that’s the most, I don’t think it’s fair, and honestly to be frank with you, a lot of people I spoke to, they always think that Australia is more racist than other places, and its one of the reasons they feel that, especially when you’re from Africa, they feel that you’re not genuine. British people who apply for partner visas, some of them, they get it 4-5 or 6 months. So, why would someone from India, Pakistan, Nigeria spend 18 months – for what! Why? Its just nor fair. I know of people who applied from the UK and got it within 4-5 months. So, why should it be different – just because someone applied it from Africa or Asia. I don’t think its right. I got so frustrated; I actually wrote a letter to the MP. I was like listen man, if you don’t want people to come, how can you tell me, I’m an honest person, I came here, I work here, I pay my taxes. And the little thing, for me to bring my family, I can’t even enjoy it.

Again, that’s one of the pain I am feeling with this kind of migration – it makes things difficult for me for planning. I love planning maybe because I’m a business analyst. I have to have a process in my head before I do anything. So, the whole migration stuff – because my wife if not here. It’s a bit difficult to make a definite plan. For example, I would have gotten a mortgage by now. My bank already offered me a loan to buy a house, but I don’t wanna do anything until my wife comes.

You weigh the options and then it’s kind of a given that you will probably be moving countries every time you get a different appointment. So, I suppose it’s a little bit idiomatic in that sense. The main factors we considered at the time – there were a few things. So, first of all, the job was great. So, I really wanted to do the thing. So, this was basically when I was still in my career of astronomy. I had already done a Postdoc in the US and I was looking for the next step. We didn’t really want to stay in the US and there were a few factors – a few reasons for that, and we were looking for places that had a few of the things that kind of annoyed us about living in the US. One of the – so there are a few logistical reasons – very mundane things, not really emotional things. There was, first of all, there’s 2 of us and there’s one job offer. My wife didn’t have a job offer so were like okay, what is a place that won’t hassle her for employment. And, at the time Australia was possibly the only place - that where the spouse visa was completely free. You could do whatever you like, you know, work. We would’ve had that only in the EU otherwise because I’m an EU citizen. We could go to the EU and me and my wife could work there – just defacto. No hassle. But, in other places that’s not the case. In other places that we’ve lived even, that’s not the case. So, yeah weren’t looking at going back to Europe then. We were looking for another adventure. So, in here it was possible for my wife to get a job. So, that worked really well. Another thing that I considered at the time was basically long-term career stuff. This is previous career, obviously in science. So, I was thinking, you know, what is the place where there is decent Science funding, and at the time it was very good. You know 2012 – there were all these fellowships, they were open to everybody. Different discussion – obviously that changed after we got here. So, I think the facts at the time were career specific, opportunities for both of us, a place where cost of living wouldn’t be a huge problem for a Postdoc salary. In the short term, we didn’t know what our plans would be for the long-term. Obviously, Postdocs don’t make enough to live here long-term, buy houses, and all that stuff but for a 3-year contract it seemed fantastic and it was very good. And then, there were some other considerations that were – like once all these boxes were ticked then we thought about bigger things, you know, what are the – I realised, as I say this, it was so nerdy, so statistically kind of informed. So, everything was looking at like society stats. What is the Gini coefficient in Australian society like, things like that, coz – slight tangent but we lived in Chile for a while. It was a wonderful experience to live but the inequality is something that bothered me every day there. Even though our jobs were the jobs that were creating more equality, it was still very difficult to live in a place like that. So, I didn’t want to move to a place that, again, there would be so much inequality. So, that was a consideration and those kind of things. That’s the stuff that pops to mind. ', '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhere is home?', '', '', '', 'H:\\tGreece. But I lived in Chile, in the UK for and US. It was all for Science. So, I went to the UK to study. Then, I went to Chile to do some extra projects for my PhD. Then I was in the US for a postdoc and UK for a postdoc. So, it was absolutely all for the Science career. Astrophysics. Now, [career] its so-called Data Science. So, umm, when was this, 4 years ago? Maybe May-ish, April, something like that of 15.\\xa0I moved. Yeah, at that point everything changed. Now, the observatory I was working for doesn’t even exist anymore. It was a really famous observatory – like world famous research facility in Sydney. The headquarters were in Sydney. And, they disbanded the observatory. Thankfully, The Australian National University took over the telescope. So, the telescope is gone into good use. But, yeah, the shorter version of it is, the government changed a year after I moved, and everything changed. It was like, where there were all these opportunities, so much funding, the funding was cut. Where there were fellowships, the fellowship programs were cut and the ones that were maintained were only open to Australian citizens. So, I wasn’t eligible to apply for anything. So, essentially professorships maybe. I would’ve been eligible for professorships, but it wasn’t what I wanted to do. I wanted to be a researcher. So, it’s just, everything changed overnight. That was pretty traumatic. So, then I had to pretty much – what we thought at the time was – okay, do we want to move countries again, and just have to kind of start over once again, or do we like it here enough to just stick around and find another job? Which was obviously a huge decision you know. I decided to me an astronomer when I was 8 years old, so did Milly. That’s like 25 years of decision making at that point. Everything is geared toward being an astronomer and remaining in this field. So, to switch away from that was quite a big deal. I lost track of the original question. [laughs]. So, current profession, yeah. So, 2015 when my postdoc was about to expire and then I looked for another job and Data Science was kind of, the obvious switch coz a lot of places were hiring at the time, and it was becoming very trendy, and it was basically a job where I could do the data analysis, do the research, which is what I wanted to do in Astronomy, but would kind of, have to give up to be a professor anyway. So, then I worked at another company as a Data Scientist. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tPlanning', '', '', '', 'H:\\tYeah, there was a fair bit. The way it works in Astronomy – you get – there are so few jobs. I mean, the whole global community of Astronomers is about 5000 people. That’s it. We kind of all know each other. So, when you apply for jobs, it’s very unlikely that you get more than one offer, if you get any. So, you keep looking until you get an offer. So, I had yeah, there was an opportunity to stay in the US, go to California. I wasn’t thrilled about the specifics of that role, that Postdoc. And then, the opportunity to come here. And then, also I could’ve just kept looking. When this came about, it just sounded very exciting. So, there was a lot of consideration obviously. But, kind of the appeal of, you know – let’s just go to Australia for 3 years – great, let’s just do that. That really shortened the consideration time because we thought it would be a fun adventure. I’d never been here but, you know, people seem to have fun here, and lot of astronomers were coming here, and they would all just say, oh, you know, it’s a wonderful place. It seems like a good place to be. So, that kind of, shortened the decision time. But yes, there was a lot of consideration – the main consideration was, the main kind of rival in that thing was, trying to figure out something in Canada because we have a lot of colleagues there, and Canada was – the stuff that we starting going through after we got here – Canada has starting going through then. So, they had started restricting fellowships to citizens and things like that. So, we were very close to getting jobs in Victoria in Canada, which was what we really wanted at the time. It was our absolute dream and then the government changed there, and we couldn’t do that. So, with a few doors closing around the world, that also shortened the decision time. There just weren’t that many options. So, once things was, kind of a clear favourite, then we took a few weeks to figure out, really, just the appeal was there, but were just trying to figure out –just the logistics of it all. You know, astronomers are not like, money bag kind of people. It was extremely difficult to go through the process of how much cost and to get here, and make sure, that there’s a bank account, and there’s money somewhere – it was a big freak out. Very very difficult situation. So, it was big decision. We took all the time we had until the observatory wanted an answer. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tMultiple options?', '', '', '', 'H:\\tRight.

Every time I’ve asked a question of people who are supposed to know what they are talking about, I get the wrong answer, and I make, I’ve made this mistake many times over the 7 years we’ve lived here. I trust somebody, some expert to tell me what to do, and I find out a year later that it was a terrible decision. It was completely wrong, and everything is just the worst-case scenario. I found out pretty much the day I landed here from one of my colleagues at ANU that – umm – this is a very high up person. He has a direct line to immigration case worker, whatever it’s called. When he wants to bring in somebody from abroad, he picks up the phone and gets that one person on the phone and says, I have a Postdoc, this is a brilliant person, and I need PR. That’s how it worked. Apparently. Yeah. That’s not supposed to happen. But that’s the story I was told. Yeah so, getting people on PR was possible but to me it was presented as absolutely, the only option you have is the 457 visa and then bla bla bla bla. So, Postdocs there were her for – I don’t know how that worked because on paper, that shouldn’t because there’s not ongoing employment. Postdocs are usually fixed term appointment.

So, that’s a very interesting topic. The decision was really, just my wife and I decided we would have this adventure, and probably just only stay here for 3 years because that’s how long the contract was. When we decided that – obviously my whole family are back in Europe. So, there’s nobody in this hemisphere even. So, that was definitely a consideration. So, in the beginning it was – oh this is only for 3 years and then ah we’ll see, we’ll probably go back to Europe because that’s a sensible thing to do. It hasn’t gone that way but at the time, I didn’t think so much about my family back home because I thought this was just a short-term thing and we’ll just get to experience it and probably move somewhere else close to home. Not to Greece. It was never a consideration, just realistically, it was never like that. But, yeah, it wasn’t, so I guess it was definitely part of the consideration.

So, her whole year, everybody who did their PhD at Oxford in her year were here when we moved here. Everybody her year, everybody the year above, everybody the year below. So many of those people were here doing Postdocs. So, yeah, my wife’s friend circle were already here. I can’t remember if we knew that or if that just happened at the same time. I can’t remember if everybody just moved at the same time as we did. I can’t remember if that was already known when we decided to move here. I think we knew that 1 or 2 people were here. Not like, 10 people. So, that was very lucky. That was the main kind of, social group in the first couple of years that we were here.

So, I think I was here something like the end of June. So, it would’ve been April when the thing was granted, and February was the job offer. So, couple of months – 6 weeks, 2 months.

We are scientists and I was granted a 2-year visa even though I had a 5-year contract or something like that. Everybody else got 5 years on their visa. So, same job title, same lab, same everything, except for the nationality, and I got 2 years on my visa, and the Americans got 5 years on their visa. [assessment levels] They told me that’s not what happened. That’s very good to know. That’s very interesting. Then 2-year visa. Then we had to renew. So, we renewed in May or April of 2014. Then, one year later, I moved to Data Science. And then I had to transfer the 457 across to my employer at the time. Then, a year later, probably a year later? Maybe a little bit less, we applied for PR as, what was the path, I can’t remember what it was called – something like direct entry on employer sponsorship and all that stuff. This must have been the direct entry stream or something. 187, maybe. Then we applied for 187 I think at Envizi. This was not the 2-year thing [being working for 2 years at an employer to be eligible for PR]. This was, I had to do the Vetassess. So, I did the skills assessment, and it was granted in 3 days and everyone was confused how it happened. Nobody knew why. Everything else was so difficult and Vetassess was just a matter of days. Oh no, I was thinking of another thing. But it was days. So, the lawyers were like, I guess you got lucky. So, the 457 renewal here was actually 2 days. So, let’s see, ah, this was also so much money bags because it went from like, $300 to $2000. This was out of pocket because this was for a government department. They were explicitly not allowed to pay for someone’s immigration expenses. They covered their side but then your visa expenses, they weren’t allowed to cover. When we came here the visa application was $300 and when we did the renewal, it had changed to $2000. I remember that clearly because $2000 to a Postdoc is an insane amount of money. Then, I got a job offer from here. So, we were waiting for our 6 months, for the PR, and I had to withdraw it because Atlassian said no, we’re not waiting for that. We’ll get you a new visa coz we don’t know how long its gonna take. It was already 6 months that we were waiting, so it might have been a matter of days. We were on a bridging visa but the 457 was still going at the time but I suppose it wasn’t transferable anymore. Yeah, so then, drop 187 application. When was that? I started here in October 16. So, this would’ve been let’s say September. So, we withdraw this application, and then October, new 457 visa. Then we get to November of 18 and we applied for PR for whatever the pathway is – the sponsored. So, that’s the present. We’re just waiting. We’ve been waiting for what – 8 months.

But yeah, the people here were completely rigid. They said no, we’re not waiting. It was at the time, it seemed like a very reasonable thing to do because the pay rise was more than considerable. In fact, the way things have turned out with the stock price, the pay rise was 100% - I’ve doubled my salary. So, it was a good decision. So, that was the consideration at the time – it was good money. But it was also about quality of work and all that. That hasn’t really changed. The work that I do here and the work that I did at Envizi – it was pretty much, you know, there are good days and there are bad days. There isn’t much difference in work for Data Science. So, that was the main driver at the time because I didn’t know how the financial side of it was go because, in terms of base pay, it was very small difference. But the stock price makes a huge difference. The main thing was also this place the work is going to be a whole other level. That hasn’t paid off, but the actual pay has paid off.

Last time I made a little mental value of how much this has cost us over the years, it was about $20,000 that we had spent already on immigration. And this doesn’t count the money that the lawyers here are gonna charge – I think that’s gonna be like 5-6k as well for the lawyers here. And, I also haven’t tallied the cost of a bunch of translations and things I needed to do. So up until essentially, up until we changed to the commercial sector, we didn’t really use, essentially any services, we did everything ourselves because of course, Postdoc pay. Up until this point I don’t even think I had to translate anything. So, one side of it is that it was very favourable conditions in academia because essentially, the university vouches for you. Back then, the university was allowed to say, look this person has written academic papers, they can speak English, no language tests, Bye, and they were given that think. Whereas, I don’t think they can do that anymore. In the commercial sector they don’t. It was either when I transferred my visa or when I applied, ah yes, so when I applied for the 187, I had to get language tests, that was IELTS, which was basically a scam as far as I can tell. There’s just one provider, and they just make up a grade that doesn’t give you the top tier English. I’ve taken the test 3 times and I’ve had different grades each time. I’ve asked for remarks and they say, oh, I don’t know, this is your mark. IELTS also cost probably $2000 or something. I took the test 3 times and it expired I guess, and then I had to get a remark because they gave me a ridiculous mark and said my reading comprehension wasn’t good. And, there were mistakes in the questions. I was reading the test and there was a 2-part question and they said, basically, the structure of the question was assertion – based on this assertion tell me this. The assertion was incorrect. You read the question and the assertion is incorrect. They say “these researchers are performing investigations on these things”. No, other researcher in you article are doing this investigation. How do I answer this question? It’s gonna be wrong. It’s a scam. I have very strong opinions about this. I mean, I spoke to so many people while we were waiting. And it’s not only that. I mean, it’s a scam, there’s only one provider, obviously there’s politicians getting bribes here. Like, I come from a country where people tell you there’s a bribe. Here, they don’t tell you. But, it’s a bribe. There’s only one provider. But they were testing people – I was chatting to a guy from South Africa who obviously grew up speaking English. He was an Anglo-South African and he needed the test to do a PhD. To start a PhD program. Oh, don’t get me started on IELTS. Many emotions there. They’re also so rude. All the staff were horrifically rude. I mean, you can’t take a water bottle in there. You can’t go to the bathroom for 5 hours. I mean who do these people think they are? It feels as though, all the times I was randomly detained in the US, they put you in a little room with a small TV with Fox news playing, and there’s no remote, and it’s on high you try to just reach the off button. That’s the feeling I got in the IELTS room. It’s quite detention-y. You feel like a criminal. So, okay, up until, the whole academic time, no commercial services used. We do everything ourselves. When they transferred the 457 visa, here there’s a migration agent but the company paid for that. So, this is Envizi. Then, with the VETASSESS, again, there’s a migration agent, and then I and to pay for VETASSESS myself. I had to take the IELTS test, which also the agent didn’t realise I had to do until literally a week before the deadline which was stressful. Actually, at this point Physicist was on the list but the migration agent told me it wasn’t an option. So, I asked, can I do a self-sponsored thing? He said, normally you would but you don’t have a profession that doesn’t allow you to do that. That was incorrect completely. I mean, I would’ve had a PR years ago – 4 years ago and then, at the same time my actual profession at the time, which was an Analyst, I wasn’t actually, on paper, I wasn’t qualified as an Analyst for the points system. So, I couldn’t apply under some archaic title – operations analyst or something from the 80’s. That would be the profession but for that you need a degree in that, which doesn’t exist by the way. Or, you would need something like 2 years of practice in that field but at that time my whatever, 10 or 12 years of Physics didn’t count because I wasn’t an Analyst on paper. So, I was eligible for this direct entry, 187 thing, whatever it was. That was the only thing at the time. They made it impossible for me to apply as a skilled worker independently as an Analyst even when I had 2 years because they changed the rules. So, at that point, this is where the big money comes in. There’s also a lot of money for translations here. Not education – that was all in English. But, birth certificate, things like that. And of course, the agent is paid. Police checks, yeah, of course from each country. Thank God I didn’t need one from Chile, because technically I didn’t live there. I wasn’t there, I didn’t have a visa there. I was just visiting there for my research and I had a time limit – like, I wasn’t there for a year. But, my wife was, which is a bundle of joy now, a current blocker for our PR. They are asking for documents that they know cannot be obtained. Police checks from Chile. When my wife lived there – we actually met there – she was a diplomat, on a diplomatic visa. Scientists in the government agency where she was working there get a diplomatic visa, the car, and the house, the whole shabang. What that means is 2 things. There is no trace of you in police records. They don’t allow to have a trace because you’re a diplomat unless you’ve done some serious crimes, I guess. I don’t know what kind of treaties are in place for that. But, yeah, and then. But, when you leave the country, you have to relinquish your ID – your super-duper special ID that you can flash to people to get out of parking violations I guess, I don’t know why people use that. So on one hand you don’t have police records, on the other you almost didn’t exist there apart from your employers assertion that this person was a diplomat here. So, now they know – like, theyre asking for a photocopy of her ID card – the special ID card. They know that we can’t get that. I don’t know what’s gonna happen but this is the current stage that we’re in. We have a letter from her employer, signed, like, everything, with like the official seal. This is an international treaty organisation that’s putting a stamp on a piece of paper. That already was difficult to get. No, not enough. They wanted to get every bit of communication to prove that we’ve tried to do this. They wanted every bit of written communication between us and the people who tried to help us out in Chile with a statutory declaration and everything. Actually, they didn’t ask for that. Our lawyer said, do that and it will probably work, and they’ve been sitting with that for 3 months now. They’ve asked for it twice. You provided this but you didn’t provide this. I was like, umm, you didn’t read the thing we provided. That’s very reassuring. So, we’ve essentially the same documents twice because they asked for it twice. So, anyway, now all of these intermediate things are peppered with these delightful experiences of going to the lawyers. They’re very good – the lawyers that we use here – thankfully. Unlike the migration agent at the previous place. So, I’ve got to the lawyers several times with a stack of papers that have costed thousands of dollars to precure, dropping them on the desk, and they go, literally this morning everything changed, or literally, 3 days ago everything changed. So, I’m beginning to slowly slip into conspiratorial thinking because they know its gonna take about 6 months to get your documents. Even if you move at the fastest possible pace, that’s how long it takes to get a document from another country. So, they change everything every 6 months. At some point - I didn’t actually finish this project – I started writing an algorithm coz they do have to by law, post everything on their website right? So, I would parse through all those documents and see how much stuff changed and how frequently it changes. I should have finished that project. I never did. I got too frustrated with the whole process. So yeah, it changes basically frequently enough that you just have no chance of getting the document together. That’s our experience with PR here in the last one year.  So, what else have we paid for? Medical tests. Terrible health insurance. I had to go to the hospital a few months ago. I had a kidney stone, and I had to go to the hospital. This is the only one option that we have for health insurance with the 457 visa. They won’t even pay for the hospital. What do you think, I got kidney stones for fun? The most recent message is like, oh you should claim that on Medicare. You don’t understand what you do, do you? I’m sure they’re other things – oh notarizing documents also. Also, that’s more or less the things that cost money. Those processes had to be done multiple times. I’ve got like 5 FBI checks because it takes them so long to process things, I need to go get another one just in case. I’ve got probably 4 UK police checks. I’ve got like, a dozen AFP police checks. Thankfully, the FBI changed their system and you can do it online now. But it used to be, you had to go, get your fingerprints done, actually no, that’s still the case. The police officer has to take your fingerprints at the precinct, and they have to send the envelope out. So, they have to do all these logistics. So it could take anywhere between 6 and 9 months to actually issue the certificate. So in 4 months, we would reapply because we thought that by the time the case worker got to the case, we would go over the year and need a new one. So, go to the police station, get the police check done, then the FBI sends a piece of paper through Auspost that probably gets lost, and they say, oh your pinky is not visible. Send a new one. Like this, is 1890 or something. But thankfully they changed this in the last 6 months and the only complicated part is the finger printing. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tFriends, family, greater community?', '', '', '', 'H:\\tSo, I’ve never been surrounded by mostly Australians the whole time I’ve live here. The very few good scientists, or scientists that Australia produces go abroad mostly. The majority of Scientists that are trained here don’t work here. So, the import is how they make up for that shortfall. So, at the observatory, there was my boss and one colleague and that’s it. That’s all the Australian’s. Apart from that, everyone else, all the other postdocs, apart from that one guy, were from all over the place. Then when I moved to Envizi, I think there were only 2 Australians among 25 other people there. I mean, Australian born Australians. No, Actually, the 2 people Im thinking about came here as children. I don’t think anyone was born here in Australia. So, very international. So, technology sector, it was very international. Now, were beginning to produce the talent here, beginning. Here, is the same. We have junior developers who are Australians and some junior designers, I guess but mostly everybody is from abroad. All the analysts I work with, there’s quite a few people in the Analytics department, umm, were from all over the place. And then, somehow, even the things that we did as pastime hobbies, whatever, we were part of a couple of Karate, martial arts communities, and even those communities were all immigrants. The community on Deewhy where there were 3 Australian and everybody else were imports like us including the instructors. The people that started the community are from South Africa. We are actually really good friends. The one that we go to now, they are from Peru. So, somehow, not because we sought out immigrant communities, but the majority of people around us are immigrants. At most, they the children of immigrants. I don’t know that I know any Australians who are not the children of immigrants. Apart from a couple of people in – when you live on the North Shore – that’s the only place where weve met people who’s parents were born – in fact, No, nobody’s parents were born in Australia. I don’t know anybody who’s parents were born here. I don’t think I’ve met anybody. And I never tried for that to happen. I mean obviously we seek out things but not at work, not when you’re at a Karate class. This is gonna sound really mean and kind of, this is not gonna sound very good. But I don’t -  I can’t think of many fundamentally Australian activities that I wanna be a part of. Like, what am I gonna do? I don’t gamble, I don’t surf, I don’t drink heavily, like, what am I gonna do. Like, those are fundamentally Australian, Australian things. Like, I don’t do these things. So, the things that I do are – and I know how pretentious and snobbish this is gonna sound – but yea, all of the things that I do, their foundation, their roots are in, essentially, old world culture. Is this thing a painting? – Im interested. Does this thing involve music? – Im interested. But those are not things that originate here. Those are not the things that people do here. And I know how snobbish that sounds, and I don’t mean it to be this way. I’m not a snob about Australia. Australia is a great place. I’m just not interested in those things. It’s like golf. I know difficult. I know, it’s kind of amazing. I just don’t care. I don’t care if golf is difficult. I still don’t find it interesting or important. So, the past few experiences have been handled by lawyers, so I haven’t done much of that. The first time, my wife, the saint that she is, she took care of that. She was like, you know, you got the job, the paperwork – I’ll take care of that which is also a very nice thing. Also, I freak out about paperwork. She’s much better at that. So, yeah, so mili did that. The first time, it didn’t feel that daunting. The second time when we were renewing our visa at the observatory, I think it was significantly more complicated. I seem to remember that. And then the lawyers took care of it. So, all I had to do is fill out their form, and then they went and adapted that into the official form. Anytime I had to look up something for that, it was like reading Sanskrit. It was just, I had no idea what’s going on. So, I definitely relied on the lawyers. The thing is that I relied on migration agents too much and I thought that Im not gonna ask everybody how they did these things because im not gonna bother them because we have this expert. Ofcourse, when I brought things up with people because they would ask, hey how’s it going with PR, did you get it? So, after we applied for this 187, and spent all this money, I remember having a drink with this friend of mine and he asked a question and I was like you know, Physicist is not on the list and we had to do all this other stuff. He says what are you talking about. Physicist is absolutely on the list and he just goes on his phone and goes here it is – it’s on the list. I was just gonna jump of the roof coz it was so expensive and so complicated and it handcuffed me to my employer which I didnt like. I was very happy there at the time but I did not like the idea at all of being tied to an employer because – this is not what happened, everybody was really nice – but as soon as they know that you’re handcuffed there, they can do whatever they like, and what are you gonna do, leave? It is the same situation here but there was no other option for me. This is the only way we could apply for PR. There was absolutely no other choice. We were gonna apply again, this time last year, July last year is when I had all the requisites and points and all the requirements, and that’s when they took the operations analyst, the something something off the list. So, I didn’t qualify. Now they, I think they said, that they would bring in this tech worker category, but I don’t think they did that, and I would absolutely qualify under that if they were no bring it in. And also, actually, one other thing changed in the meantime. So my wife also changed from Astronomy around the same time as I did. Actually no, about a year later, and she wanted to do technical writing. They changed her profession and bumped it down to the short-term list. So, we couldn’t apply through her, and she’s an American citizen so we would’ve gotten much better treatment. But, she’s no longer eligible for PR because technical writer was bumped down to the 2-year list.

Oh, actually, this reminds me, we did use another migration agent at some point because I completely lost trust in migration agent in my previous company. So, we actually did pay a bunch of money to another migration agent to confirm what this person was doing because we lost trust completely. And this was through a network, our freiemds who are also immigrants told us this person, she knows everything. That was very good. We were seeking advice about a few things, very confidentially – we were asking if we apply through an employer and leave the day the PR happens, what’s the worst-case scenario? Do we get our PR taken away, do we get deported, what’s gonna happen? So, we were seeking an answer to that question. And again, nobody has the answer to that really.

I don’t like it. I wanna go to a gallery and see different things. That’s a very old world sort of view of the world should be about. It is not Australia’s view and I don’t begrudge it. Australia has many other things that are amazing but not for me. Theyre not amazing to me. They still don’t make up for the shortfall of traditional culture, the things I want. It’s a much friendlier place as well. Our decision was reinforced by a million times after the horrible thing that happened in Christchurch and the response that they had there. Ive never seen a people, a society react so well to something so bad. I mean, the US went on a wold wide killing spree after 9-11. These guys have the worst crime that’s ever been committed there and somehow everyones wants to move there after the response. We were actually there at the time after that happened, and we get there, and it’s a really grave atmosphere. But, people are going about their business. We were in Wellington, not in Christchurch. We were talking to everybody and everybody’s having conversations about it and saying you know, how oh you know, im gonna send a little book to the mosque tomorrow. We were in tears the whole time we were there because it was the most beautiful human reaction to something bad that had happened. It was extraordinary. That really reinforced this desire to move that. And it’s a place we can afford a house.  People in politics get in the way of things here all the time. Its not a progressive country which is fine. I don’t have to live in the most progressive place. That’s ok. But when it becomes, like, refugees are in concentration camps, and we refuse to put solar panels in our eternally sunny country because our friends in coal won’t make enough money – that’s pretty much the 2 most significant things in my world right now. You know, basically destroying the, like, it’s like a proper existential threat to humanity and this country is doing the exactly the opposite of what it should be doing, and I just dont wanna be here because of that. I know that leaving is not the answer. Staying here and having the opportunity to vote – in however many years they let me do that – would be a way to combat that. The climate change stuff, Im not gonna be waiting for 4 years to become a citizen to combat that. Im gonna go to a place where I can contribute to that sector, and they have a huge renewable sector in NZ. In fact, they run most of the renewables from Australia – wind farms, hydro, and solar – most of the actual commercial capacity is run by Australian companies. So, I could actually go an contribute there instead of being a drag here because every time I put the heater on, I’m screwing up the environment. Im not gonna freeze in the cold either. Yeah, its politics that is driving us away. It also, I felt this on a personal level whe I first got here – how can these people vote for One Nation? People we know, people in Karate, were like oh well not you, like all the other riff-rafs. It was infuriating. I just wanted to punch the wall, and I did sometimes. It was exasperating and I took that on a personal level. I don’t anymore. But now I see it as a big societal issue. This really is a thing. People don’t feel so strongly about there being horrific racists in their family. They’re like, whatever, Ah, uncle Tim’s a racist, some people are racists, ah, its fine. Or I’m not really a racist, I just want sensible immigrants to come here. Get out of here!', '', '', '', 'M:\\tFuture plans?', '', '', '', 'H:\\tBecause PR here gives us work rights in NZ. 4 years of presence in the country but yeah, we’ll seek citizenship in NZ. Here it’s a completely unknown – how long it would take. In principle its one year. In practice it won’t. Coz you have to have 12 months of presence in the country before you’re eligible to apply. Then it can be months. Sometimes they say ah yeah sure, and then it can be months or years until your citizenship ceremony, which is when you actually become a citizen. So, it could be 3 years. So, meh, I’ll wait an extra year and be in a place that I really like. That’s the plan.M:\\tWhen did you first move to Australia?', '', '', '', 'Cr:\\tWell I moved to Australia only 4 months ago.

Fortunately, both of us, he and me, we have certain economical resources. So, for example he could go to… he went to Argentina last year, he stay with me for 2 months.

But the IELTS is not only the cost of the examination, you have the fee but also private classes. Those private classes started in March, middle of March 2018. I can’t remember the exact date, but it was middle of March 2018. And I did that because I wanted to improve my communication skills. So, after that the immigration agent. He charged me the same fee to apply for the visa here. I can’t remember numbers, but I think it’s more or less between $600-700. So, he charged me that. Plus, I can’t remember exactly but it was about the same to apply visa. And then I had to attest documents. For instance, my degree, letters of recommendation from my 2 jobs, financial situation – I needed to prove that I have enough money to support my living here for 1 year, other things – I need to pay the fee so I paid $10,000 – that’s the cost of the year. I paid altogether, you know why – because I wanted to… just to get rid of it because the rest of the money, I know its just for me. I don’t have to worry.

I only could improve myself with that role. I kept my job at the university. I have a license there. So, it is 2 years. It is a university for Engineers.

So, for instance I have courses in civil Engineering, Mechanical and so on, like something general and they considered me for license. So university - I love it.

I didn’t expect and really, I like him. Yes, I love him. But loving someone is not enough but also how you work together.

So, it was really, a good experience but it was really hard t break into the community coz everybody goes, you know. They grow up on an island and cant wait to leave, and I was joining it. I was there for a couple of years. And then I moved back home and worked in the local government for about 4 or 5 years, in policy. So, I did policy development. And at that time I went back and did my Masters in Policy development and management. It was quite interesting how policy was written, and then got frustrated with local government, and also I had my kids at the same time. So, went free-lance and did some project management for Arts and Cultural projects, and I did that for about 10 years, and then saw a PhD position. It was in cultural policy, and I thought that’s really quite interesting. I’m kind of a really curious person and cant imagine not learning. So, I applied for this PhD position – never got it. So, I was gutted. Then they phoned me a couple of weeks later and said that we’ve got this other PhD, not in cultural policy, but in design innovation – you might be interested? So, I jumped on it. So, I did my PhD as part of a larger design project that involved 5 Art schools, it was a national project and my PhD – So, I was funded for 3 years, and my PhD fund had run out after the 3rd year and I wasn’t finished. So, I had to work full time from there. So, my PhD took 6 years. But I finished, and then for the past 4 years I’ve been working on this digital health project.

So, I’ve come from a small specialist Institute, and the focus there was just design. And, my research is a bit trans-disciplinary design – so across faculties, across institutes. So, the offer of the university here was that of course, it’s a huge university, and there’s lots of faculties. So, lots of opportunities for cross-over.

I actually applied for a different post. I never got the different post. So, I had a second interview and they said, no I didn’t get the post, but they have this other post – if you’re interested. I said I might be interested in that. So that was the end of November and they said, well can you come out and look at the campus, come visit us and see if you like it. So, they flew me out in the second week of December to have a look around. So, I spent a week meeting everybody, deciding if it was or wasn’t what I was going to do. That was 8th of December. So, they had offered me the post, given me the contract. I had to accept it by, I think, the 18th of December before everybody broke off for Christmas, so that they can start the visa process. So, that was the 18th or 20th of December. I said yes, okay we’ll definitely take the post, we’ll make the move, subject to the visa of course. The visa came through, so yes – that was Christmas time, the school closed, and I was still getting emails from HR requesting all the information. They sent me a long list of everything they needed. I needed to get the police checks, I needed to have all the birth certificates, all the addresses where you’ve stayed, copies of my qualification, and all that kind of paperwork, and all the kids birth certificates and all because they were gonna sponsor us all to come over – and before Christmas. And, they did their part of the visa application, and I got an email on the 3rd of January from the immigration office just asking me to submit my part of the visa application, and the money – pay my part of it, and the visa came through in a week. So, it was crazy fast. By the time we came back to work after Christmas in January, the 15th of January, we were getting ready to go. Although I hadn’t handed in my notice at that point because I couldn’t hand in my notice if I didn’t know my visa was gonna come through. So I went back to my old job in January and handed in my notice and asked them how long do you want me to work for. I’m meant to have 3 months of a leave time before I hand in my notice, and they said okay fine, if you can finish your teaching then you can go whenever. So, I handed in my notice with a finish date of 23rd of February – was gonna be my last day at work, which was a Friday and then we flew out on Saturday. Must be the 24th. So I only had, really, that kind of 6 weeks from Christmas to when we actually left to fly and everything, sell our house, everything. We only came out suitcases – sold everything. We’ve stolen a room at my parents house for things I couldn’t sell at that time, and things that I wasn’t sure that I want to get rid of you know, that type of thing. But it was quite cathartic – just stuff you accumulate over 20 odd years. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOrganizing stuff here?', '', '', '', 'L:\\tThat was crazy. So, when I came over in December for my visit, I kinda had a couple of days where I thought I’m gonna go have a look at what’s available apartment wise or house wise. I did 2 or 3 viewings and I almost cried. None of the houses were good – they were just awful. The problem was that we left a beautiful house in Scotland. We’d renovated it, and a huge huge house, and I know I wasn’t gonna get something like that here. It’s a city. We came from a rural, coastal village. So, I started to panic. And the university sent me, as part of my welcome pack, and it had, I got some relocation expenses for moving us over for our flights and towards our visa, and also they offered to reimburse an agent, or some kind of help with finding a house. The limit was $10,000 – 10000 or 5000 – It was $15,000 altogether and we could choose to spend that however – like using a relocation agent or a housing agent, or however we wanna use that relocation money. But actually our flights were about $12,000 alone. So, I couldn’t spend on a relocation expert. So, we just had to kind of do it ourselves online which was crazy. Because its so expensive and particularly coming from the UK, where the wages are not nearly the same as what they are here. So, having to find the money that we can put down for a month’s accommodation, and visa cost, and – coz I knew I would have to wait for 2 months to claim it back from the university. So I begged, borrowed and stole from parents and – until we had enough to pay for our first months accommodation. So we ended up booking an Airbnb for the first month in Lilyfield – its towards Rozelle. So, we got an Airbnb there for the first month and it was nice, it was a house, 3 bedrooms, so the little ones were together and my son had a room to himself, and it was close enough to university for me to commute – it was 20 minutes by bus. So, it was actually perfect. It did the job, and then in that time we had to find something permanent. It was really difficult. We – and I think more difficult for my husband coz he had done all the renovation so he didn’t want to live anywhere that wasn’t as good as what we had. So, really not a lot available. We looked eveuywhere. We looked at apartments, and we looked at houses. We looked all over Sydney. And the problem was I didn’t know what suburb we wanted to be based in. I forget what its called but theres a site online where you can check the suburbs and theyre given ratings. Its not Domain – I know that site the back of my hand, Ive been on it, you know, constant. Theres another site – I cant remember if its know your suburb or… you can type in, like you can search all the Australian suburbs and its gonn agive you ratings for family friendly, or convenience, or distance from the city. And we ended up scouting that and finding out which suburbs might fit, and in the end we – that last week of our Airbnb, we still hadn’t found anything. So everyday – and I was working at that time – so it was up to my husband and the kids to go look. So everyday, my husband was looking. Every evening, we were just going to viewing after viewing after viewing. And we wanted to be in the Northern beaches. We wanted to be next to the water, and on the last Wednesday before we were due to leave the Airbnb, we said right – we can’t find anything in the Northern beaches, where else can we go. And somebody here said, well have you looked down in Sutherland shire, coz you know the beaches down there. So, we said okay lets go down and see all the open viewings that day and so we went down to Cronulla, and Caringbah, and we saw one house that was perfect. It was a brand new built, 5 bedrooms – so enough bedrooms for everybody, had a swimming pool, and it was the same price as what we were looking for apartments in the city. So, I was just like, this is just amazing. We took it on the spot. So we took it for a 2 year lease. So, there’s another – as part of our searching, I had set a radius from the university of an hour’s public transport, just basically drew a circle. I just wanted it to be an hour maximum. So, I am pretty much just an hour door to door. 40-minute train ride and 10 minutes walk each side. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tFamily', '', '', '', 'L:\\tI think my parents are finding it quite difficult – particularly difficult because I’m the eldest of 4 and we’re all in 4 different continents. So, my brother is in Canada, my sisters in West Africa, Im in Australia, and just one brother at home with my parents. My mum and dad – I was the first one to have kids, so they’re really close to my children. When I was doing my PhD, I had to travel 2 hours to university. So, my mum used to come down at 5 in the morning to let me go for the 6 o’clock train, and she would leave the kids to school, then go to her work and come to mine after work, and give them their tea, and put them to bed, and get home at like 10 o’clock at night. So, she had a lot to do with my kids. They find it really difficult. But, they’re also supportive. They’re happy to – and I had told them that I had applied this job in Australia. They were just like – oh what has she got on her head this time. And then when I got it, my mum was excited, but my dad was very quiet. My dad is never quiet. But it’s been fine. They’re coming out in October so that’s really good. It was also difficult.. so, I come from a huge, massive family. My dad’s one of 11 children, and my great granny is still alive. She’s 97. So, 11 kids and then there’s 38 grand-children that are my generation, and 36 great grandchildren – the generation before, and we’re all over the world. Theres some in Australia, some in Singapore, some in America and Canada. So, she was really happy for us. She was really really just so excited. My other grandmum, so my mums mum – Shes gonna be 90 this year. She’s had a lot to do with my kids as well. So they used to go to hers for tea couple of nights a week, and going to see her after school. But she found it really difficult when we told her. I think that I find that the most difficult part. My mum and dad are fine – they’re busy, they’re working, they’ve got a social life. But my granny – she doesn’t leave the house. So us going, I think she’s really going to miss the kids, and my son particularly, hes 14, and he you know, did a lot of baking with her, and you know, had a really close relationship. So, that was hard telling her. But everybody else, I think, was quite happy. It’s a close knit community there – so I think its about 700 houses. 2000 people. So everybody knows everybody, and I have a really close group of about 10 girlfriends, and all the kids are the same age, and it was hard telling them coz all the kids have grown up together, we’ve grown up together in a way I guess. But everybody was really positive. There was a few comments of you know, why are you going to the other side of the world? Why! Why!. Laughs.

So he’s right across Asia and New Zealand and sometimes hes based here. So, I asked him for advice. But he’s a bit older than me, not married, and doesn’t have kids. So, he has a kind of, different perspective of Sydney than – So he was helpful because he provided an address that I could send my bank cards and things to, coz I was worried about things going to the Airbnb, and we’d already moved on. So, he could provide a permanent address that I could send important documents to. Apart from that, not really. I kinda just had to scour the internet for advice and all that. Some of the people I met here were really helpful. I got some emails as I was preparing, saying, you know, if there’s any questions, just let me know. Particularly, once they found out I had kids. Lots of people suggested things about school’s coz that was another problem right – where do we go to school. What’s a good school, do we move to a particular area to find a good school? They’re quire strict with the zoning, and the school systems are quite different. You’ve got your private schools, and you’ve got your selective schools, which weren’t open to us on our visa, so it was gonna be public schools. On our visa, my kids can’t get entry to selective school. We could pay for private school, or the public system. With 3 kids I can’t afford to pay for private schools, and my husband isn’t working yet. So, I’m the only one earning – so there’s no way. But, actually, we visited a couple of schools in the area – around the house, and we basically just ended up picking one. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSkilled visa', '', '', '', 'L:\\tIt is interesting. So when we were first coming out around, 2012, my husband would be the nominated skilled person that time coz I was in the middle of my PhD, and hes a carpenter. So, he would’ve had to do a skills test, and he refused to do a skills test. He said, I’ve been a carpenter for 20 odd years. Why would I need to go and show someone I can hammer a nail to prove myself – and he had to pay for that test as well. He was like, Im not gonna do that. So, that was a little block for us then. This time around, it was interesting because it isn’t called a skilled visa but they didn’t – apart from my qualifications, and a letter from my employer to say that I’ve been working in this capacity – that was the measure of the skill. It was interesting coz I, you know, my former employer, I got on really really well with him. So, they did really give me a good letter of reference. But I didn’t demonstrate my skills. You know, I just provided someone’s opinion of my skills. So, it was interesting for me to see how they imagine what skills are. How they articulate skills, particularly, in this context – you know in teaching, or design. They didn’t talk to any of my former students to find out if I was as skilled as I had mentioned. So, it was interested. I had to provide that letter from, as well as my reference, a letter from my employer to say that yes – I’d been working in the capacity of a senior lecturer position. I had over an x amount of time and had managed to demonstrate the skills required to perform that role. But they gave me a template for that letter for my employer to fill in. I think that was the university. So, it wasn’t even something that I had to write from scratch. Just had to fill in my name, job title, and the length of time. I guess the university knows what they’re looking for. They do this stuff all the time. But in terms of permanence, yeah I do really want to be here. We don’t want to go home. My daughter, the middle daughter – she’s 12, she’s been hearing that we’ve got a 4-year visa. She says, you know in 4 years I’m gonna be 16, im gonna be an adult, I can stay back by myself. So, if you go home to Scotland, you’ll be leaving me behind. Laughs. But yeah, I would like to see us translate that into a permanent visa. We think after the 3rd year, the university can sponsor me for PR. I did ask that in my interview, if I could go straight on to PR as opposed to TSS, and they said no. That would’ve been easier for me. I guess the added incentive was that the university was gonna pay for the relocation. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tMapping', '', '', '', 'L:\\tSo, I think. So, the visa category was a working holiday visa, It was 2001. I don’t remember what the number was and I think that I. I came out in September, no I came out in May. So, I definitely know that I flew home on the day of the Sept 11th. So, I woke up and saw the twin towers fall, and thought to myself that I had to fly on a plane all the way to Scotland. I had 3 flights to get that day, and I remember, I woke up – and I was at my aunties in Brisbane coz she was gonna drive me to the airport to get my flight to Sydney. And I remember, just waking up, having breakfast and we’d put on the news, and just watching it happen, thinking, oh my goodness. I was phoning my mum and saying I can’t possibly be flying today, what am I gonna do. But actually, it was fine. It was a really interesting flight. Everybody was kinda shell shocked and there was no luggage, like, some planes were not running. I remember I had to wait for hours in London for a final connection. So, yeah it must’ve been 2000, and 2001 when I came home. Yeah, crazy. You just never forget.  So I didn’t plan to come to Australia on that working holiday visa actually. It was between my 2nd and 3rd year at college. I wanted to go to Japan. My cousin was working in Japan at the time, and I was studying textile design, and I remember saying to one of my teachers oh my cousin’s in japan. I’d really like to go and get some textile-based experience in Japan, take the summer break. We have an extended summer break in Scotland – so it’s like May to September. She said to me I think you don’t have enough knowledge or expertise yet to do any kind of work in that field, and I was gutted. So, I never went to Japan and that’s when I thought I’m gonna actually take some time off and go to Australia. So, WHV – I don’t remember how long it took but I don’t think it took long. I just remember you had to have a 1000 pounds in your bank on a statement to show for the. So that was 2001. Okay, so then we came back in Christmas 2011-2012. We came out for 4 weeks, just a tourist visa. We went to WA. So, we went up and down the coast of Western Australia. So yeah, and then I saw the job advert, and then I was invited out. So, when I came out, when I was invited out, they said, it was in the end of November, they said, well can you come out in the next 2 weeks, which was great – it fit in my schedule but I had applied online for a visa to come out, and it hadn’t come through. They booked my flights, they paid for all my flights to come out and had applied online – it was just a tourist visa, online on the government website, and it wasn’t coming, and it wasn’t coming, and it said it will just take 40 hours to 5 days, and the clock was ticking, the clock was ticking. The day before I flew, I phoned Australia to the government thing to say, I got up in the middle of the night to phone them and say, Im meant to be coming out, I’ve paid for my flights, I don’t have the visa yet, and he said yeah theres a backlog, theres nothing we can do, you shouldn’t have booked your flights until you had your visa, and I was like Oh God, whats happening, and I happened to have mentioned it to someone else. So, nobody knew I was coming out this week. I hadn’t told any of my friends or family because I wasn’t gonna say that Im going for a job interview in case I never got it. But I had told my mum and she had spoken to somebody at work who said she can get a tourist visa from the estate agent, no travel agent. So, you can get a tourist visa, you can pay 20 pounds at the travel agent in the UK anyway. Not sure about anywhere else and I’m not sure about what it’s called. So, the morning of the day that I flew, I went to the travel agent at 9 o clock, asked them to open the door and they gave me a visa for 20 pounds in about 20 minutes. And that overrides the visa. So about 3 days into my stay here, I got an email from the government site here to say that your visa application has been cancelled. I’m thinking, what’s wrong and then I realised that it was the one that I had done online. So, you can’t get visa on arrival for Australia for me, on a UK passport. They wouldn’t let me on a flight if I didn’t have a visa. So, that was my problem. My flight was gonna take 36 hours. So, I had asked what if my government one comes through by the time I arrive? Would that be okay? And he said, well you’re not allowed to leave Scotland unless you’ve got a visa in place. And it is exactly the same visa that the government would give you but it is a different name. Its just a tourist visa. They just click a few buttons and they give you this and it lasts for 3 months, which I think is the same as the government one. But its not in the government system. Although, it must actually go through the govt system because the govt system emailed me to say we realise you’re already in Australia so we’re gonna cancel this application. So, that was a bit of stress because the morning I was flying, I was like I don’t have a visa to get in. So, I arrived, then went home again, took the job, and then the visa’s came in 6th of January 19, and we booked our flights for 25th of Feb. I was scared to book the flights until the visas weren’t there. So it wasn’t the job I applied for but I knew as soon as I came for the visit that I was gonna do the job. Absolutely. And I said that to them. Although afterwards, the dean of the school, the boss, said I didn’t think youd actually were gonna do the job. I was like really! Why!. She was like, I knew you were adventurous, but I just thought it would be too big a move for the entire family. I said well.. I always found it interesting that people interview for jobs and have no intention of taking the job. I was always gonna take the job if I was interviewing for the job, if I got offered it. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tCommercial services', '', '', '', 'L:\\tOkay so for visa prep, we had to have. So, that was a bit of a pest because they asked for all of this information over the Christmas break where everybody is shut, and everything’s closed. But we had to get two police checks. So my husband had to go get that. We had to pay for that. It was like $160 each. We had to have pay slips – 3 X payslips from both of us plus the annual tax review. We had to have the whole family’s birth certificates. I couldn’t find mine either. I found the abbreviated version but not my full one, and our marriage certificate. It was quite confusing because the university have an HR relocations person and I was issued with a contact person, and she was like my constant throughout. So, she provided me with all the information, kind of step-by-step, screen-shots of what you need to do, and usually its quite straight forward but some of the questions were, So she said – they recommended use a visa agent to do your visa application. I didn’t. They gave me list. So, they provided a list of people and companies who could do it for your visa, for schools, for accommodation. So, they provided that. I decided not to use an agent for the visa because I thought it was gonna be easy, and it was generally easy. The question that tricked me was the IELTS because I’m a national English speaker. Do I have to do IELTS? And I had to come back and ask that and she said no no, the university ticks that all for you. So, everything else was pretty straight forward. So, it’s a 2-part visa because its sponsored. So, the university had to submit all their paperwork to say that this this the post, and this is a post we can’t fill with anyone locally, the labour market testing, and then once they had their approved, they send it on to me to submit all my paperwork and the fee, and I think the fees, altogether was like $7000 for the family. The kids were quite cheap. That’s when you think we really should’ve used an agent because if that’s wrong then they can say were gonna keep that money. But luckily, it was all right. We didn’t need any medical checks. So, that surprised me because I had to have a medical check for my temporary working holiday visa. I was very surprised. What my visa does require is that I have private health insurance and I don’t know whether they think that if you have private medical insurance then you’re not gonna be a burden because you’re gonna pay for yourself but I had to tick … there were a few checkboxes that I had to tick to say that I was in good health. I’m not a bad person. But it was all self-check. I had to have... I had to supply 2 names and addresses for character witnesses to provide a character statement. I don’t know whether they were requested though. So, it was contact details for somebody to provide a character reference and I provided – one of my really good friends for the village is also a policeman. So, he certified all of my documents and he also provided a character reference – his email address and his address. I don’t think he had to sign anything to say it, but he had to agree in person. I don’t know whether they actually did that. I had to provide the letter of skills from my employer based on a template. Yea so, when the visas came back in January, they said well this is your visa paperwork and of course, it’s all just digital. So, it was just like a think you print out. But as a condition of your visa, you must have your health insurance. I’m like, yeah, that’s fine, I’ll do it. But, by the time I got around to doing it, it was like 3 days before we were leaving and I was like.. what if they ask me at the airport, have you got your health insurance and if I say ‘Not yet’, then they might not let me in through the border. Okay – so try to do it online. And there are a number of – the university game me a list of insurance people who would do the health insurance for me so I went through them – basically just trying to find the cheapest one coz UK health have a reciprocal agreement with Medicare so that still covers you for the basics and… like I finished work on the Friday, flew in the Saturday – this is the Wednesday, I thought I’d get this organised. Just between selling everything and saying goodbye to people, it just slipped my mind. So, it wasn’t through. I had submitted all the applications and done all the paperwork but didn’t receive a confirmation yet. So, I had visions of us being stopped at the airport. But actually, nobody said anything. In about a week that I was here, I actually phoned up the company that I had submitted my applications to to see – am I insured, whats happened and he said oh yeah we just need a bit more information and then we’ll back date it to the date you arrived. So, that was quite straight forward. I actually don’t know, I think I’m with NIB, but I don’t know what I’m insured for. Never used it. We’ve had three visits to the doctors for my kids since we’ve been here but just used Medicare. Nobody even asked for this. But it’s a condition of our visa. The condition of our visa is always have health insurance and I don’t take any work apart from this job but Alans open to work wherever he wants to work. My husband was worried about his police checks because he was arrested as a teenager for being drunk and disorderly. But, he’s like, he’s 46. So that’s a really long time ago but he was really anxious about it. But that was all fine. I don’t think there was anything that took long to come through or that was difficult to get. I guess in this whole process, we were realising how much money it was gonna cost and thinking is it worth it? Coz we had to pay the visa fees and we also – we have to education fees here. So, each of the kids, we have to pay the government fee of $5200 per child per year to go to school. So, that was gonna be extra. Its meant to be lump sum but we argued that I’ve got 3 kids. I cant afford that and all this. So, we’re paying in 2 blocks. It is still a lot of money. It wasn’t until a couple of weeks ago.. somebody said that, that’s actually a lot similar to some of the private school fees for primary, and you could’ve thought to put your younger one in private school. But actually, they’re settled in this school. Its interested because the schools don’t get that money. The schools get about, I think they said, about a hundred dollars extra but the government get that money. So, what am I paying that money for? Do you know what I mean – like if its not going to schools for providing education for my child. That was another reason I wanted PR at the start because then I don’t have to pay the school fees. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tTechnology', '', '', '', 'L:\\tAll the visa prep was all online. All submission of documents, even the police check, everything – it was all online which was simple, easy. I guess from, probably when I was invited out was when I started doing some actual online research thinking hmm this might actually happen. So, I… it was really difficult finding information about family migration and stories of family migration. I found one blog and I kept coming back to her information (I cant remember the name) – and it was things like thinking about schools, thinking about suburbs to live in, and she was just one person who actually migrated herself I think and its quite out of date. But everything I searched for, I just came back to her. So, it was this one woman blog. It was quite outdated but she had guest submissions to her blog. I guess she had guest submissions about visas and stuff. Why it was so difficult – there was lots of information about 457 but because 482 was so new, it was difficult. There was very little in terms of peoples experiences around it. That was difficult. I don’t Facebook, I don’t use FB. I have FB to have access to my kids dancing classes because that’s where they post that information, but I don’t use it as a networking thing. So, there was nothing on there that I looked at. But this suburb site – its like a suburb rating site – I used that a lot. And the problem with these kind of sites is that they’re like review sites but people only post negative reviews generally because there’s no incentive for you to post something positive. But, they were a good indicator of what a suburb was like I felt and so we did use that a lot for reviews and Domain and Real estate. I was really just wanting to find a resource that was about family migration but its fluid. There’s not such a thing as a resource. Who’s gonna keep it up to date? I’m sure there were those things where I clicked at something and there was a response in a forum but I never engaged in a forum. There are – although now – our house that we rented for a year, the owner, the house owner, out it up for sale about a month ago. I was like oh no were gonna have to move again, what are we gonna do. There were a couple of open houses and then it got sold. It got sold in the 2nd viewing, and the people who bought it are gonna continue having it as a rental so we can continue to stay there. So, we were like phew. But I did join the Sutherland shire community facebook page because I was looking for other houses in that area. There’s a buy and sell and swap page, but for me, I was hoping to find other accommodation on that site. Although I didn’t need to use it but that’s what I imagined I would use it for. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSocial Connections', '', '', '', 'L:\\tSo def my cousin Stuart who was based here for most of the time. He was quite important. I guess he was important for providing that safe post box but also to know there was somebody here if something was to go crazy and also when I knew, so it wasn’t gonna be the job I applied for but there was gonna be a job, I needed to know that the money they were offering me was money that I could live on coz I actually had no idea. In the greater scheme of things – how much does it cost to live in Sydney, was I gonna be able to live on that wage. So, this is someone I could ask those questions to.. this is what theyre offering me. Is it worth it? Would I manage to live on that? And of course he said yes. So, he was like a sounding board. Martin here, who is my line manager. He is from Austria originally. So he’s a migrant too and he shared about his experience, and hes been here a long time now. It was helpful coz hes got kids too and he talked about what that was like. His kids are kinda similar ages as well. Lots of people at home in Scotland were really nice. So, when the community, they heard that we were moving they were like ‘Oh we’ve got family here, or we know this person’. So we got lots of addresses and phone numbers. We never followed up on any of them. But, I guess they’re all kinda there. We just haven’t had time. It was so fast. So, people were always happy to provide, you know like somebody, in this context that could help if you needed them. And, Amika, whos the HR relocation person – she was great because I sent her lots of emails to say…what about this, what about this, how long till I get my money back. I don’t know if there was anybody else. I did it all. Alan just got on the plane with the kids. He didn’t really do any of this. And then I guess we had the people at the stage that we sold our house. Actually, we put it up for sale when we were still there, but it sold after we left. So, my mum and dad were power of attorney to sign off on that.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHusband?', '', '', '', 'L:\\tSo, when we arrived the kids… So in Scotland, the schools run from August to July. That’s the school year. But here the School year runs January to December. So, we moved in Feb.. they had already done 6 months of school – in the school here. So, when we got here, they had to go back 6 months which meant that they didn’t have to go to school straight away. They had about 6 weeks to get settled in before they went to school. So, Alan didn’t work that time, and it was good for me because it meant I could focus on getting to work, finding my feet, not having to worry about childcare and that kind of this. So, that was the first 6 weeks. Then we moved into our house in Sutherland shire so that was a couple of weeks before school and then there was Easter holidays. So, he said he’d probably go to work after Easter holidays. They went back to school after Easter holidays and he started looking for things, for jobs, but there was nothing really. I don’t that he was actively looking, and then there was summer holidays. My daughter got sick in between so she missed about 2 weeks of school in that term so he was off for that, which was okay. And then there was the summer holidays. So, it was like, okay, after the summer holidays, and after the summer holidays I had to go to Malaysia. So it was like, okay after I come back from Malaysia. So now the kids are back into school and hes gonna have to start looking for something. But hes gonna look for something part-time so he can work around the kids. He fancies a career change but he doesn’t know what and he isn’t the kinda, you know, hes in a new place, perfect place to have a career change. But the longer hes gonna think about it, the harder it is going to be for him to get a job. You know, the confidence, and so on. But he needs to build a network, so I feel he needs to get a job, and I’ve been trying to do that in a diplomatic way. Laughs. But, it’s just not happening. So, he is, he doesn’t really do online coz internet was after he left school and all that. But he does do Gumtree coz that’s where he was looking at cars, on Gumtree, coz we don’t have a car yet. So, that’s what hes focusing on at the moment. But, he does the school run in the morning. So, he sees all the parents and stuff but the area that we live in, its more of a – its not really a city – its more of a suburb. So a lot of the mums don’t work.. theres a lot of stay at home mums.. so its mostkly mums at school who actually don’t really speak to him. But he has made… so we have 2 sets to neighbours that we have become good friends with and he has 2 other neighbours – one is 70 and one is 80 – and they keep knocking on our door to ask him to come and do little jobs, like lift things, or fix this, or fix that. Every time he does that, they try to pay him and hes like no I’m not taking money for this. So he comes home with these things.. he came home with a golf set.. he came home with a mixer… theyre just giving him stuff. So, hes been meeting people but he doesn’t have a network of people who are the same age, and I think that’s what he would need for him to get into work. And I think, its difficult coz our roles have completely been reversed as well. So, he was the main breadwinner and now hes not working at all, and I’ve got a network here and he doesn’t have that. So, its difficult for him. I don’t doubt that its difficult for him, and that makes him homesick. And because he was away working offshore a lot of the time, so he didn’t have the time with the kids. So, its nice for him to have that. But he has to adjust to what that feels like because it isn’t all roses like he imagines it. The kids are grumpy in the morning and he gets annoyed about making lunches, and da da da.. so I think, its just gonna take some time.

Think time around, it just happened so quickly, I just went with the flow. Usually I’m really, I do a lot of research. I’m a researcher, that’s what I do. But this time, it was almost like it happened. I didn’t expect it to be so easy and I did not expect the visa to come through so quickly and I think its because of the university in part because it’s a huge institution and they do this regularly. One of the big concerns I had coming was disrupting the kids, you know they had friends, and their lifestyle. So, I was really wanted to make sure that.. So, my daughter dances and my son does jujitsu. So, I wanted to find somewhere that they could get back into this stuff straight away. So that had a lot to do choosing the location as well. And I did use that Sutherland shire FB page to see what dances available, what jujitsu places. So, I guess that helped get recommendations because theres 100’s of dance schools. Whats a good dance school. So I did use that. There was, one of the first weeks, in our house. There was a local newspaper that came through, and it was volunteer week, and there was a call out for volunteers to go visit older people, elderly people. So we had a chat at home and we thought well lets sign up for that because the kids don’t have their grannies anymore… just that intergenerational connection. But we never got around to that. That’s on my list to do because I think that they’re missing that and if they can give that to somebody who doesn’t have that, that would be a good thing. But, its just time.

Shes not convinced. But I guess Im just trying to share that knowledge. But in terms of challenges, I guess its just that things online – particularly for academic migration – were framed around the single academic, and not with their family because threes a lot of movement within academic staff but not always with kids and a husband. And even, the information from the immigration adviser was framed around, okay what does it mean for me to come as a single person, but I was like, I’m also coming with 3 kids. What does that mean for US? So, that’s the main one. But then nobody’s got exactly the same story. So, I don’t know what I was looking for. Its constant movements with academics and actually now that Im here, there’s lots of international staff here, and there was lots of international staff in my previous job as well but you just kind of take it for granted when you’re home. You don’t really think that they’re going through all this visa stuff in the background. But academia is international. I do quite a lot of travelling with work anyway. Not so much here, greanted. But last 2 years have been 5 or 6 destinations a year. So, I’m quite happy to navigate that system. I guess maybe for Alan who doesn’t do that much travelling, hes anxious he doesn’t have a physical visa in his passport. So, when I did my first move we both had the WHV stuck in our passport – like something like China do now. But now everything’s online, so he feels anxious coz he doesn’t have something to say that he’s entitled to be here. He’s looking for that physical stamp that says he can be here, especially at airports. It doesn’t bother me much but I know that it causes him some anxiety.

It’s a surprise for the kids. I’m gonna wrap her in a box at the front door… if I can keep that a secret. What I would like is for her to migrate. She would do great. Shes 10 years younger than me.

I guess, Alan would like to go to NZ. He spent a year working there and he would like to move there. He sees himself live there. I guess Canada is an option. My brothers there and he loves it – absolutely loves it. But even back to Europe, maybe Switzerland or Denmark, something like that. Although, Im quite open to that but ceaser has got his exams next year and that’s gonna limit where we take him. We have to think about what will happen to his education, and then we have to think about university. In Scotland university is free if you’re a Scottish resident. You don’t pay any fees. But you’ve got to be living in Scotland for 3 years before you apply for university. So, if we stay here for 4 years, he will be the age to go to university, and if we go home to Scotland, we would have to pay for his education. He won’t get that free coz he would’ve been out of the country. I think we’re imagining that we’re not gonna go back but that will be something we think about if we were to move somewhere else.

We sold our house and at the moment that money is sitting in the back, risking being spent on other things. But, its just so expensive here that we don’t know if we will buy a house or we’ll just rent, or will we move elsewhere in Australia. Again, that will be dictated by my post, my job, whether it will be a promotion or just a similar role in another area. Definitely be open to looking at, although I love it here, but potentially somewhere norther, where its cheaper for houses. Because we come over with just suitcases, we spent the first 3 months just buying furniture, looking for furniture, or like cutlery… all of the things you don’t really miss until you’ve got to use them. So, I’ve just got a dining table to get and a car – those are the two things. We’re actually looking for a van so we can go away and things, you know, we can put bikes at the back or the surfboards at the back. One thing I do love about Sydney is the public transport. It’s just so easy and so cheap. It’s just so so cheap compared to Scotland. So cheap. Im in the highlands of Scotland where the infrastructure is really poor, the buses run, like, every hour and the train network doesn’t reach anywhere you need to go. So, I’m loving the public transport. So, we go to the beach. Most Sundays were at the beach. Saturdays, the kids have clubs – dancing and all those things. But once we have a van, the idea is that we’ll go on a Friday night and come back on Sunday. Once we had decided to come, I was thinking Oh God, theres gonna be no house that we can afford. Everythings gonna be super expensive. The housing is super expensive. But in terms of food, like its pretty much the same that we pay in Scotland. For paying the bills, electricity and gas is cheaper than what we were paying in Scotland. So, I guess we are.. actually, we’re on one wage but probably living the same quality of life that we were in Scotland which is good. Just 70% of my wages in going on accommodation which is crazy. Super crazy. Everything else is alright. That’s another reason why Alan needs to start working. Im really conscious... I don’t want to start chipping away our house money coz oce we start, its gonna be gone.

', '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat were the motivations behind your decision?', '', '', '', 'Ma:\\tThe main motivation was, like, I wanted to challenge myself. I mean.. Ive been working for 12 years – always in India, or was in middle east for a year. In 2017 I happened to go to UK for a while and then when I came back, and when I wanted to go back to UK, somehow it didn’t end up working out with my employers and then I had a friend over here in Australia. I spoke to them and he was like, give it a shot. If it works out, it works out. I don’t want it to be a situation where in 5 years down the line I’d be thinking – I had an opportunity or I had a chance, and I didn’t take it. So that was one of the reasons. The other motivation was like.. so being married for like 5 years, I was sort of thinking if we plan a family, or whenever we start planning a family, if we have a base in a secure or better environment, well get good benefits out of it. And also the passport advantage that Australia has, or the government benefits that anyone gets over here. I mean like, back in our country, you know the facilities we get – be it education, or medical benefits we get, or the advantage that the Australian passport has – so that 3,4 reasons were the motivations. The major motivation factor for me was my wife. She was like, I think you are saturated over here. You need to try something new and that’s where we started. And it worked out for us, like, the eight-10 months we were. We started the process and within 10 months we were here. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tThat’s very quick. What pathway did you take? Was it skilled migration. ', '', '', '', 'Ma:\\tIt was skilled migration. So when we started the journey, my friend was one of the main motivation or motivator for me to try it out. So back in India, I used to trade in stock market as a past time. I made money, I lost money. So the way my friend convinced me was – you would have lost like 50 grand easily in stock market. Why not spend 50,000 for this – do your skills assessment and give a English test – be it IELTS or be it Pte – so why to spend 50k and see if you can score a good, if you can get a good assessment, why not try it out. So that’s how we started. So started collecting all my experience documents relating to it. So then, last – so back in India, I had my 12 years of experience – I worked with like 6 different employers and like fortunately, I had a very good relationship with both of them. And I spoke to them and I said that I need an assessment roles and responsibilities letter from you stating that this is the role that I did, and this is the responsibilities I had and I worked full time – whatever format I need. And we got that letters within 10-12 days. Its like I was fortunate enough that all my managers or managers in that point in time were still there in the organisation. I just had to drop a mail, give them a call and they were like okay. So, the first question they asked me was – what do you want in that letter? I was like I have already given you. You just have to validate that and give it to your HR. If youre fine with the format and whatever I have written into it, then you can go ahead and tell your HR and get it signed and send it back to me, or Ill come to collect it, if theres a need. Since I had a very good relationship with them, they were more than happy to do that stuff. And yeah, as I said in 12 days I got all the letters.  The other thing was cracking the English test. I was, like, deciding between PTE and IELTS test. So, I did some search, spoke to couple of friends, went to migration forums, understood which one is easier to crack. Then decided that PTE is the one because one can fool computer algorithm and crack the exam, but.. When I say ‘fool’, its just that, you don’t have to right or wrong – you just have to pronounce few words in a particular way and the algorithm will understand that yes, this person can speak in native English. In IELTS there is a person sitting in front of you. He or she may be biased. He or she may not like what you are saying. Or he or she may judge you based on the way you are communicating, even if you are giving the right answer, they may say that the person is not understanding. Whereas for a computer, you just have to say things in a way that the algorithm wants to hear it. And with some practice tests…and… first attempt, I didn’t crack it, I mean, I didn’t get the score that I wanted. Second attempt, I got the score. Then I did the, by that time I got the ACS assessment done, and it assessed all my working years as a relevant experience. So, I happened to be with highest age points, highest experience points with English score.

But, with an Australian passport, there are certain advantages. Like, for example, like, every Indian or every sub-continent guy has a dream of working in US, and day by day, it is getting difficult. Australia has an e3 migration clause with the US which has about 10k migrants, I mean, they can take about 10,000 skilled migrants which only gets filled by 1/4th every year, from Australia to US – people applyimg for work permits etc. So, US has a streamlined arrangement with Australia where they allow like lets say, for H1B, they have a pool for 10,000 lets say. In the same way Australia has, lets say, 5000, which, out of it, only 1000 gets filled. So even if you read todays newspaper, US is trying to give that share, or whatever pending quota, to Ireland. So now, lets say. So, Ill give you an example of my friend, who took an Australian passport and applied for a US thing, and hes now in US. He took like 6 years time to get to US, but now he can work indefinitely, I mean some sort of arrangement wherein he doesn’t have to go via H1B or something.

I mean you can go anywhere in the world, and work, or visit, or do anything. I mean like for example – I can give you a recent example. A funny thing happened. My sister and her family were supposed to visit us over here, in 2nd week of May. But their visa got rejected for the stupid reason like, um, there’s no, um, there’s no definite ties with India. I mean they are not going to go back. I mean, they said there is no surety that you will go back. I mean like, shut up. They showed a very good bank balance, they had a return ticket showing that they were gonna go back, they have a settled business over there. But still they didn’t get it. I am literally shocked. I mean my nephews and nicer – they were crying over there. Theres no option of appealing it – in tourist visa. You have to reapply it. So now, with an Indian passport, they struggled. So for example now, if I want to travel with an Australian passport, Ill be taken with arms open. I mean I don’t have to worry at all of getting a visa. I get an on-arrival visa from 100% countries.

Going to Canada was one of them because I have my aunt staying over there. So, I can get an additional relative points and I could easily go over there. But I didn’t consider Canada just because it was too cold over there. There was an option of Germany where I can get a 6 months temporary work permit, where I could go over there, find a job, find a sponsor, and I could get a work permit over there. Or a temporary permanent residency over there. Then the 4th option was about moving to the middle east. I mean, it was always open. I mean, twice or thrice I rejected the options that I had – moving to the middle east for a bigger role or bigger opportunity. I didn’t feel comfortable over there because of the restrictions it had. Like, I have to be, like, I was there for a week in Saudi Arabia and I was like, terrified. I cant even take a picture of myself. If someone is there in my background, they might come and just ask me. So, I was there in Dubai. I liked Dubai a bit. The only thing, like I was apprehensive coz lets say one fine day, my employer says I cant, I don’t want you to work over here anymore. I have to again find a sponsor or else I have to come back. Like, I have seen cases where people have worked for 15 years, their kids were born over there but they have to come back. I didn’t want that to happen with me. I wanted something, like wherever we go, we stay. And also the other thing was, the parents thing. I mean, I thought about, like, if we move to Australia, theres a possibility that I can take my parents, which, I don’t think that Canada had that option, there were some conditions. And also weather wise, like my mom has high BP and some sort of heart thing so I thought she might not be able to adjust over there.

So it gives you an idea how one applicant stands in terms of their oral communication, written communication, or understanding what the speaker is saying, or be it reading.

So, it just gives you an idea about the trends. But expat forum was like – THE platform for me – where I could find – all the answers were available on that. So, within expat forum, I happened to meet – I happened to be a part of whatsapp groups. Then from whatsapp groups we got the discord community wherein right now, about 300 people are there.

Because a couple of flatshares were available and I contacted them or they contacted me, and it might have worked out but then we found a place for ourselves within our budget. But yea, Indians in Sydney – a bit. But yea, its become a piece of a joke. I mean everyone on it is cracking jokes. People ask a serious question and people are just making memes of it. So telegram is also an app wherein one can post in different groups. So, theres couple of clients that I know. They were running like 5 different types of preparing groups – one was only about preparing for IELTS or PTE, one was only about preparing for pre-PR process, documentation and helping people with documentation, one was only for post PR wherein after getting the PR what should one do about migration checklist and then there was a jobs group. Since whatspp has a limitation of 256 people, telegram doesn’t have any limitation. One doesn’t even need to know the phone number because it can be based on email ID. One does have to get a link to join a group and then they can join it. Even discord is something like where no one knows your mobile number or email ID. Its your discreet identity, whatever you want it to be, because people think about the security point of view as well. I don’t want to share my mobile number with anyone so Ill tell you – this whatsapp group became a problem after I migrated over here because people were calling on whatsapp. I happened to be an admin of one of the groups that I was a part of initially. People were giving me a call at night at like, 2 o clock, 3 o clock because back in India it was like 9 or 10 in the evening. They used to give me a call, like, Mithun, we are at so and so points, do we have a chance, or people who already got the PR – did you get a job, do we stand a chance, do you have someone you can recommend us. But I couldn’t… so I left that group and said that I am part of this discord community so if anyone wants to have a question, I am free to answer over there. Whatsapp – So I was part of 3 different groups. Each had about 150-200 people. One was only specific to my skillset. It was defined only for business analysts and systems analysts. They had about, like, 150 people. There was a generic group only for people applying for 190 or state sponsorship for NSW. It had about like 200+ people. And there was a generic 189 group where everything was there. On an invite day – or when there is an invite round, there might be around 200-300 messages within an hour. Like 12 o clock Australian time, the invite round starts. So by 1 o clock Australian time, there would be like 300 messages. People might be asking questions like did anyone get an invite. If one said I got an invite, there would be 200 people saying congratulations. Or if one gets a PR, there would be 200 people saying congratulations, you got a PR.

So I can say that I was earning aplenty in India where I could afford a house, a car, a pleasant lifestyle, don’t have to worry about anything. So, I was like, money is not a factor for me. Im going for our future. When I say “our” – it was about my, my wife, my kid as well as you – you guys – you have struggled all your life and need a peaceful life, or deserve better and I don’t think India would give that justice to you guys. And I want to really make you go around the world and.. then the other thing that I asked them was like if 5 years down the like I don’t want any regret, so would you allow me. So I guess, when we were taking a decision, it was a collective decision. So first one was why – but I wanted my parents as well as my in-laws - my wifes parents to say yes about it. They need to be in a positive mind, they need to support us, they need to say yes. If they said no, we wouldn’t be over here.

But that was not the case. That he realised when we got the PR and within one month we were planning to move over here – he realised how much prepared I was for taking that decision. He almost thought that, Im this way, Im just taking my time here. He didn’t realise that me and my wife were pretty much prepared for it. I said to my dad when I got the visa that I am arranging funds for you guys for a year because my dad has an income or its like, hes more of a retired guy. So I was like I am making arrangements for the funds for you guys which you can survive for a year and if need be, I can also arrange for one more year – if I don’t get a job or of either of us don’t get a job in Australia. So, you don’t have to worry about it. You don’t have to stay or do cost-cutting, live life in a shallow budget and all.

So, as I said February – I just give you a timeline as well. So, March, I got an invite from NSW as well as Victoria. So March 18 is when we got our nomination, the invite wherein we had to submit all the documents. So, NSW approved me and within 5 minutes I got rejection email from Victoria.

So theres this guy from Melbourne who used to give, he was on 457 and he was thinking aboit applying for skilled migration visa and just when he was thinking about it, Victoria decided that… there used to be a pathway that 457 could directly convert into a state sponsorship. They were about to close it and he tried, he was scared, he wanted to do it but he got a bit complacent and didn’t do it. And one day is a day when finally it stops and Friday people started floating news that its closed, its closed. He got panicked and he gave me a call.

Would you be able to do your application right away? Yes yes, Ill do it, ill try but already it is closed. I was like, just give it a shot. Leave everything to destiny. And he applied for it.

Generally, for 457, if they are approving it, they get back within a week. So, even close to a month, they didn’t get back to him and after a month a reply he got a reply that his nomination has been approved. He gave me a call. He was so happy, he was like Mithun, you helped me a lot and you are the one because of who I was able to do otherwise I would have given up because he spoke to like 4 or 5 people and they all say – you can’t apply, you can’t apply. I was the 5th person who he gave a call and I was like you give it a shot. And I’ve seen people misguiding people on this process, or scare people, or what I’ve seen is people who have already moved over here – they try to manipulate people who are still in the journey. They see them as a competition and they try to… If you go to Harris Park or somewhere – they say that ‘bhai tera zaroorat nahi hai yahan pe’, you are not required over here.

They are Islamic but they were like, you come to our place. We were vegetarian so they didn’t cook anything non-vegetarian at their place for like 15 days – the number of days we were staying over there. They had a toddler and even he used to have, like, egg omelette in the morning. They didn’t even cook that for him. After 10 days we came to know that he used to eat that and we had to tell them – ofcourse that, its fine. We don’t have that restriction or anything. We are fine with everything. You do not have to cut your intake just because of us. So yea, They changed our perspective one more time.

So, I was supposed to go to US but all this visa challenges etc.. So, the alternative I was considering was Canada and Australia. Right, couple of options. Among that the favour in Australia was the weather and also the thing about Australia was the dual options to work in Australia and NZ. NZ is slightly behind from global opportunity standards but still it gives you multiple options. So, and also, if you look from an economy standpoint right, Australia looked like more opportunities available compared to Canada. So, these were more educated guesses from what I could find in research. This made me, and, more than anything, the process also was much more convenient and easier compared to the other parts – Canada or any other countries for that matter. And one more driving factor was when I shortlisted, English was a big factor coz if you try Europe or anything, the language barrier comes in. Australia was a big win and Canada as well when it comes to the local language. I started my career in India. So, pretty much born and brought up in India. Then I went to the US for 4 years, then came back. Then for about 3-4 years we were trying to go back to the visa process, you know with the economy changing, it got rejected again and again. So, then I took a couple of years off to decide what I wanted to do. But then myself and my partner thought it would be maybe good to just explore. Even now we’ve come here – we don’t know what’s gonna happen even 2 years from now. So, we’ve just come here to explore and so far, it’s been good.

We just wanted to go, and travel new places, just to see different cultures. So, it was US and UK for a while. So, Australia compared – 1 was work visa was an option but compared to that PR was slightly better. At least at the time I decided to apply. It was more like, lets apply and see how it goes. It was not like I want to go king of this. It was more like let’s just give it a shot and see if it works out then we’ll give it a shot. It was more like, baby steps. So, it’s very short. We started our thought process sometime like November 2016, and after a year and half I was here. Nov 2016 was when the idea crept in. One of my friends suggested. So, the thing about Canada – because a couple of my friends stay there – but we thought about Canada. There were a couple of factors – the cold etc. So, when you start talking to your colleagues or close friends, we thought, okay why not Australia. We started to do some research over the net – it was the immiforum, everything. What we found was it was very simple. Whether it’s a right thing or wrong thing, that’s a different thing – but it was very simple. What all they want was very quantifiable. So, it was just – we started addressing one by one, whatever needs to be done. Thankfully, the forums were very (what do you say) very explanative. Immiforum. One of my friends gave me the link. There are people who list A to Z of what needs to be done. So, you don’t need to worry about anything, you just follow. I think Immiforum, I don’t remember. When I started off, one of my friends suggested this forum site. So, you know when you search migration to Australia – one of the first thing that comes up is do you want to go to a migration agent who can help you with things. So, that’s was the call I had to make. Do I want to consult someone? Then I started with this forum. Anybody who knows how to work with computers could do it. It was pretty straight forward. So, I said we don’t need to spend that money. So,  then the thing was trying to get into what are the steps we need to do. So, Nov-Dec – December was pretty much trying to understand, alright what do we need? So, a bunch of English tests. So, we gave IELTs. That’s when I realised, I couldn’t write for nuts. So, you for for 10 years, with IELTS its back to basics. It was like school. So, I gave it a shot. Still, I was just getting 60 points. I was like okay this cannot be good enough. So next thing I did was I gave the ACS. That was a big shocker for me because they figured my 6 years of experience was not valid. So, I had close to 12 years of experience at that point, but they deducted 6. So, my points again went down to 55. [Laughs]. Then I decided to take the PTE. One of my friends suggested that. It’s a computer-based test and it was very interesting. I blogged it. I studied for a week or so. During that time there was an emotional turn in my family. My mother in law had a heart attack. I was in the hospital for a week so couldn’t prepare much. Then I called PTE to reschedule and they told me because it was less than 72 hours or something, so can’t reschedule. So, I just went there and took the test just like that and fortunately I got 20 points out of it. It was my first attempt and I did not prepare well for it. I just knew what the pattern was. So, that’s when I realised probably my English was ok. Sometimes it takes a test for you to know what your strengths are. So, 2 IELTS and 1 PTE. So, once I had that, I already had 70 points with me without even my partners points. So, I just went and submitted the EOI in April. That’s when they told me that since I was in the US for 4 years, I had to get the police verification done. That was the biggest thing. So, there again the forum helped me understand what I needed to do. That was the biggest process. So, I submitted the EOI. Had to do all the yards post US. That was the biggest challenge because now I heard you have tracking numbers but in 2017, they didn’t have. So, you had to send it to them, wait for 12 weeks, email them, call them to check if they have received because you have no tracking number, and this was like, you have to hand-write and post it via DHL to them. So, they don’t confirm to you. So, you have to keep on tracking yourself. So, I was more concerned about that police check than anything else. Good story was that within a couple of months I already got the invite. The first round – because I think from April to June was the freeze period, they don’t process the applications. So, one of my friends said you have the state nomination but since then, when I saw the trends, you know the immi trends, it was very quick. You know, the first round, I got the invite. So, I got all the other documentations in place but I was still waiting for the police clearance from the US because they gave us 2 months. Then I realise that when they sent the post to India, it gets lost. So, then I called them to change the address to post to my friend who lives locally in the US. So, when I started reading, people were saying that usually for India, it gets lost. So, they gave me an option to fill a form and submit change of address. So, I gave my friends address who stays in the US because you don’t need a physical copy. You just snap. So, as soon as he got it, he just sent me the snap through Whatsapp. So, using all that I was able to initiate my visa. So, once the visa was applied there was nothing to do, just waiting for it. So, they told it takes 9 months. So, I put it at the backburner and just continued to work, whatever I was doing. And the the CO gets assigned. I was checking every 15 days or so, nothing happened. But just, after the 30th day or 45th day I got the letter directly. I didn’t get any CO or anything. I got the PR grant straight forward. It was very smooth. So, I think I did something right. [Laughs]. So, the thing I was saying is that on the forums its pretty elaborate. So, since you work in the IT field you know how to name the documents and stuff. So, I made sure I have my own check list, you know, what I need, and do the forms etc. in parallel. So, it’s very quick from the time of initiation in April to receiving it. October 31st my letter was in hand. In India I had a 3 months’ notice period. So, you can’t move before 3 months. The good news was that I had 1 years’ time. So, it came in Oct, and I had until next year September (to move). So the 2 schools of thought were either continue working, bring your wife here, put a port up and go back. Then we decided it would be too much hassle. I was okay, what the hell, I’ll come here first, try for couple of months to get a job. So, decided okay, lets one of us go, while she can continue working there. So, see how it goes and then. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tCommunity?', '', '', '', 'Ay:\\tSo, first part was here I knew no one.

We were not really sure why my son was falling very sick but from all my friends who were abroad, they would say, the probability is slightly lesser. So, we were like let’s give it a shot and see how he adapts. So, we felt it could work out better because he had this case. Its call febrile fits, its seizures, febrile seizures and theres no reason for it. So, he had these, little bit if health issues. So, we thought let’s go abroad and see how it will work. So, I came here and my wife was still back. So, the initial idea was I’ll come, get a job, work for 3 months, get some income and then I’ll bring my wife and son along. But, it so happened in the 3 months, my son was missing me so much. There was so much pressure on me for them to come here soon. So, the day I got the job, the 15th day I found a place – whichever place they gave me coz then I learnt a little bit about the rental history as well. Its not just the job. They don’t give you for first, like first time rental is not easy. Apparently, I was blessed, there was this one guy, this one agent who trusted me. He said, it you want it you can take it. I just want 12-month lease. But that was a hell. There was one day I saw 15 houses on a Saturday. I didn’t have a car and I walked 13 km that day starting from… so I had a calendar with me where I was listing from Rhodes till Westmead. I saw Rhodes, Denniston, Parramatta, Westmead – so I saw close to 15 houses in that day. So, the houses which were good had 50 people looking. So, I stand no chance. Houses which had no one, I didn’t like those places. So, after that finally one house was okay, not an issue. The agent said okay. So, that worked out. So, the day the rental was sorted, the same day I booked my flight back home. So, the first salary, I just booked a flight. I went over there for 3 days because I didn’t get a holiday.

Prior to that, first month salary, I just went to IKEA, bought few stuff, went for the electronics, and a friend in Melbourne put it on some card she had that gives you 5 years interest free of something. and one more friend lent me some money and said just keep it.

I didn’t even think that was a permanent thing back then. But then I met my boyfriend, so.. this how it basically give me an idea of moving to long term. So then, I think stage 2 would be when I actually moved here as a PhD student in WSU. So that one was only 1 year and this one is for 3, no 4 years. The consideration is pretty clear. The consideration will be that my bf is here and then also it’s a very good place for career for a scientist and also I considered that it is a very good diversity place – cultural diversity, I think that they have a better acceptance, I think in terms of you know, migrants. In HK its not as many migrants as here.. umm.. also because my bf is not HK people and its easier if I am here with my boyfriend. Like if my bf come to HK then its more of a cultural shock for him.

I didn’t know what do you call them.. like recruitment for just PhD scholarship. Like online website for PhD positions worldwide. That’s what I was looking for. And I actually did look for job available, for example, on other job search engine, like seek.com or stuff like that.

I didn’t look up all of the options.. and I trust myself as a PhD student or a potential PhD student. I kind of think everything is already online. I can just follow whatever the direction over there. And the good think about moving from HK from over there because HK was a British colony so all the documents is already in English or in Chinese, so I don’t really need a translation. I think... umm... yes, about that, I actually got an education agent in HK, but then the whole reason of it is just because so many of the documents they need here, they need certified but then.. they basically.. what the service they provided me is the certification because in HK we don’t really have a service thing, that I need anything certified.

Stage 3: I think I applied for it last year – that’s partner visa. The consideration I have is more about the career, because as a student, as a PhD student, you know we have that awkward period of time where we submit our thesis and then we have to wait certain months without any support until they declare – oh yeah, you can graduate now. So, I don’t want to have no job during that period of time. But then with the student visa we have this restriction that we can only work for 20 hours per week, which is really little.

This one, and then during this time when I was looking for accommodation… so like flatmates.com which give me idea of where I can get accommodation. Skype with boyfriend or whatsapp. During the time, after my exchange and before I got PhD, so one factor, because my bf is here so I want to find a job here. But the other factor why I really want to leave HK is because this event happened – it’s a political movement called umbrella movement. So, what happened is that most of the HK youngsters trying to get a real democracy system to choose their – we call chief executive, but basically, the mayor of HK. We didn’t get a very fair system for doing that. Umm but that is one of the thing that get me really disappointed with HK. So, I guess that can go into it as a political reason. This is getting me very frustrated with the political climate in HK. Like the govt can do anything because at the end the movement, I mean, during this time of the movement they are a lot of youngsters that go for protests and they just sit on the road for ages, I think that go on for months. But then at the end the govt actually didn’t do anything. They just clear the site. It actually poliriased the entire society in HK. So the people, they probably think that it would be better for HK if we stay with China rule but then with the youngsters,l they started getting this idea of getting independence from China, stuff like that. So that is one of the idea that I feel that I am really disappointed with what is happening in HK. So, for – its kind of going into the idea that I already have that I want to move but then it actually strengthened it. It made me feel like I really need to move. I think to me, it’s not like a sudden change for me during this period of time. I think its more just gradually when I move here, and I’ve been living here for 3 years, and during the time when I’m going back to HK, I don’t feel as much of a connection over there as being here because I have my new friend circle and new society, so I don’t know, I feel more connected here nowadays than back in HK. It’s like a slowly growing, sort of, idea of moving.', '', '\\t', '', '\\t', '', 'M:\\tAny regulatory aspects, any significant govt requirements that you had to fulfil?', '', '\\t', '', 'J:\\tOne of the major challenge here is to get the police check in HK. That was a bit more difficult because I think for most countries they do it online. Ive heard that other countries you know, they just click click click, like online, and then pay for it, and that’s it. But in HK you have to get a Fingerprint first. I think I can write police check in HK. And then so, the difficult part is that it want me to get the finger printing and then also they only accept paper application. So they don’t have an online system. So, yeah its very confusing because HK is a big city and everything but then, it can be vert backward at times – paper application. The challenge is that the finger printing is not that easy because you don’t do it at home. They want me to go a police station locally and do that. But then normally in Australia they don’t ever do that kind of service for normal people. So, I called up the police station and they only … umm.. one thing. They don’t normally do it, They only allow you to do it locally in the police station that is closest to your suburb. So Im living in Quakers hill so they only want me to go to that one police station. You cant even get to parramatta or any other station. You only have to go to the really local local suburb. So the PS doesn’t normally do it. And then when I call them up, like I called them several times but then they were saying oh, if they have someone that’s retained in their, like, I don’t know, they have someone that’s retained in their room then they cant access the system to do that. So, I don’t know, maybe there are a lot of criminals around. Everytime when I called them up they were like, Oh we have someone in the room – sorry. So that too me, you know, really long time to do that. Like a month – to just to get a fingerprint. And then after that, because they only accept paper applications, they also charge me money. So, to do the payment is also quite difficult because they want cheque, you know paper cheque, which is very ancient. You know we don’t use that. So I think with all these things, The major thing I can say is Technology – they are not up to date on technology. That’s why its making it very difficult. Its very rare, but there are some people migrating from HK, they are experiencing exactly the same thing (forum). The other thing would be difficult because it’s a partner visa – you have to gather all the evidence that you’ve been together. This very, I mean its everywhere, like, you know flight tickets that we are travelling together, we are living together, we have a shared accoungt, but then all those tiny tiny little things and you have to gather them all in one folder or one file.

It would have been a tough one because I’ll tell you something. We did try to migrate somebody from the US entity to Australia and Australia had some specific laws on x amount of dollars that you should spend on training to be eligible as a sponsorer, which we don’t do because we have a really small team in Australia.

We really didn’t have to do anything except for closing all our…closing our chapter in Singapore and moving here. Maybe 3-4 months – and they took care of our visa and everything.

Anyway, Im in HR so I had to see what it… how does it translate. I have a cousin here so we did reach out to him a couple of times to ask what he thinks about Australia, living in Australia, challenges, things like that.

My mom on the other hand wasn’t very happy about it because she wanted us to be close to India and Singapore is very close to India.

When we were making the decision and going back and forth, it did play a big role because Im a social person. I have a lot of friends in Singapore and I knew that I wouldn’t know anyone here so it was a tough call because that did play a factor but in the end, that was the trade-off.

The second consideration also was that we were actually renting an apartment in Singapore and we were already tied in that contract till Feb. So, we had requested that any move only comes after that.

I met him in India but my plan to move to Singapore was already in place before I met him in the sense that I wanted to move out of India.

I had travelled to Singapore a lot of times with my job so it was an attractive place to work from and I wanted to move there. So anyways, those interviews were going on. I did get some offers and then when I started dating my husband now, I did also start a conversation with my company to say I want to move there. And that’s what happened. They were able to move me in the beginning of 2017. I start5ed the discussion in 2016, and he was able to move there as well with be because we were kind getting serious in the relationship and he had his own company at the time, which he could easily operate from in Singapore.

I think the skills that I have, which is currently about my career is mostly recruitment, HR, employment law is what I work on and the fact that I have experience across regions.

Everyone in the same field has usually or more often only just handle Australia in HR, and that’s also most probably because Singapore is considered a headquarter for such roles where they are handling a broader region of more than one country. I think, that’s where I have that skill. So, my skill is still listed in the long, is it long? – as a long-term skill but there is a problem there. What Australia considers skills for HR manager, I don’t fulfil that because of them the team size should be bigger than the team that I currently handle. So, as per Australia’s definition or skills definition, I actually fit into the HR adviser role which is a much more junior role than I’m at so I don’t fit in to an HR manager role.

That’s because, again, my company was really small and their details were not registered with the government. So they came back with a lot of questions. My partners visa came much before my visa. We had actually moved to Singapore even before I had the visa. So I had already signed a contract with the company and I was off India payroll and on Singapore payroll already when we moved but I was travelling significantly for work in that first month. So, I was hardly in Singapore. So, technically and legally I started my contract with the Singapore entity when my visa came, which I think was the 11th of Feb and my visa process I think started in December. Before that – it was like a business visitor visa. So, I wasn’t getting paid anything. I only got paid once I had my visa. So when we had to sign the lease as well for the apartment, because we moved in, I couldn’t sign the lease as well because I didn’t have the E-pass that was needed. That was fine because my company had sponsored a month’s accommodation. So now, here [Australia]. So, processing time, the visa, when they applied for it, it actually came back in 5 days. We went for our honeymoon, we put in our documents, we were back in and we had the visa. I think that’s also because they [the company] are like a platinum sponsor or something like that. So, processing time just for visa was 7 days. And then a month to move after the visa came. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tCommercial services?', '', '', '', 'N:\\tMaybe I’ll start with Australia. So, everything was sponsored by his company. So, we spoke with a lawyer, a migration lawyer/visa agent in Australia. So, we were on the call. We spoke with the tax consultant. The migration agent was a corporate one but not with his company. A corporation that they had tied up with. So, going forward if this company applies for a PR, they will use the same agency. Then we had a tax consultant just to ask about how taxes work, and any questions about that – so that was another agency, tax agency. And then there was – how do you call it – this person was part of the company who, what is that word called in companies where they help people migrate – Global mobility representative who was asking about what’s important for us, whats not and when he [husband] mentioned whether its easy for my wife to get a job, and answering such questions. And then there was this shipping company. Again, this was by them – another agency who was, who helped us understand if we need to ship anything, how much it will cost, and if it will be reimbursed by the company or we will need to pay for it. So, for this they had tie ups across the world so somebody came to see us in our Singapore house that we just need to see if you need to move anything. We also had some stuff back home in India that we wanted to move so again, same company’s counterpart in India also visited us. I don’t know the names of these companies. Obviously theres police check and all. So for shipping, in the end we took the option of shipping everything ourselves. We didn’t use this company because we didn’t have enough stuff to ship. We didn’t have, we were not moving furniture, and then were reimbursed by the company. Police check and all we did but again, we didn’t pay for it. We didn’t have to pay – I mean in Singapore you don’t have to pay for police check. Both Indian and Singaporean – both you don’t pay for. Its just a record that they give you when you go to them. We didn’t have pay anything. It was pretty straight-forward in Singapore for both of us. We just had to go and get our police check done and it was done in maybe an hour or something. In India, it was a bit more complicated. So, we did our police check and then we did the health check in India again. This was in India, and we paid for it but we got reimbursed by the company. We didn’t have do anything else – our documents were all in English. My husband didn’t have to give an English exam but he just had to show certificates to show that his education was all in English. So, we just got that certificate.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHealth Insurance?', '', '', '', 'N:\\tNo – for the first year, his company paid for our health insurance. So, for every year after that we have to buy our own, but my company pays for health allowance for both of us. Private insurance is a requirement of our visa and we get that from my company. Okay so that’s agent when we came here. So She reached out to us as soon as we came here and asked us basic things of how many bedrooms we need, what is our budget, what area we like, what kind of people are we. She shortlisted some places for us and then we had a day booked for us to go look around. She did the – everything she did. We didn’t have to pay basically. And she is also from a partner firm employed by the company. And first month accommodation was taken care of by his company.

The air tickets for both of us were also paid by the company. So, nothing. Our dollar value spent was only for moving from Singapore back to India, and shopping. Visa process has been easy – I think that was really easy, I mean the visa. For me, getting the Singapore visa was tougher coz I had to do everything. Here, because the company was so organised, moving – the visa process and physical movement was easy. But when we came here, things were not easy because we were used to living in Singapore and things in Singapore are much much easier. Like apartment hunting as well. Here its – I mean over there, it’s a very buyer’s market. So, we could go and see the same apartment 5 times and they’d take our phone every time we’d make a call. Here you have to make the call the same day or else you lose it. Second thing, fully furnished apartment is a very common thing over there. Here, its not. So just, once we had the apartment just buying furniture and buying everything was a headache. Singapore is great in public transport. Here it is not that great. End-to-end connectivity is not there. We needed a car in the first few months so that was a big challenge itself. Bank account opening wasn’t also as easy as it was In Singapore. In Singapore, you go into a bank and I think in 5 minutes you have everything ready. Your credit card, your bank card, everything. Here, the bank account opening took a few hours and then for the credit card as well, we couldn’t get a credit card because we did not have any credit history and then even when we got one, we couldn’t get one which we could use to get points for our expenses that we did. So that was a bit challenging as well. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tTechnology', '', '', '', 'N:\\tSo Social media mostly in terms of reading articles about, umm migration to Australia. There was a lot of information available on what you should be prepared for. Google. Then also about, I guess, compensation and benefits analysis through different. This was mostly through recruitment reports in terms of how much will it cost or how much the same role will get paid in Australia. Cost of living adjustments and that was also through payscale as well as online through google. Taxation because there was a lot of – the biggest thing for us was that there was a lot of difference within the taxation in Australia and in Singapore in corporate tax. So, just understanding how that might affect us in terms of compensation as well. [income] Not better off here although the income is slightly more than Singapore, but the taxation is much more – practically double. So, at the end our take home is much lower here than it was in Singapore. But, having said that again, there are pros and cons to be balanced here as well, in terms of how bit the role is and what we’re doing here and stuff. But yeah, the taxation is very very high. There’s some things that are more expensive in Singapore.

We were not ready for it. We even went to a point and said, okay say no to the company. I think it was just, the more we talked, the more we asked people, the pros and cons, we realised that we’ll take it. Just for future stability, we’ll take the decision from the point of view of again, visa, if we plan to have a family, Australia is a better place to have a family, point of view of owning a house, owning a car – things that Singapore will never allow us, and in Australia those options are possible. I think the big thing was the weather Singapore’s weather is definitely not the best weather.

I think I have learnt a lot here as well. I never drove in my life. Im driving now. The country has a lot to offer. Again, if you think of having a family and future, we definitely think we would like to bring our child in the world in this country rather than other places where we’ve been before. Will we always be in Australia? We’re still not sure on that because again I still love Singapore a lot so if, in the future, if we do happen to get a permanent residency for Australia, probably we’ll see if there is an opportunity to move back to Singapore just because I like the country and its closer to home. Maybe ill put my father on the map just because it was important that I spoke with him and he was extremely for Australia. So, that I think gave us the confidence and boost that we’re making the right decision. For both of us, I think we really look up to my father.

There were some disagreements [between me and husband]. I really liked Singapore, There was no problem, I still had my visa, he would have got a job easily – his skillset is in demand. So, yeah, it was, that was the number 1 challenge. The second challenge, Im just gonna mention in terms of moving. Second was, I did know not know even till the visa process had started, if my company will move me here. [going back] I also researched about employment opportunities here. So, I had started talking to employment agencies here to see if I will get a job here. So that was the challenge before we moved here. Once we moved, I guess, should I write about things like not having a car/mobility. Also, not having enough funds in the beginning because we didn’t move all our funds to a different country. So, we had to really think about spending or where we were spending, bank, credit card, and just for everything – in terms of how the country operates, from transport to opal card to what you do – there was nobody to tell us that. So, I guess general country whereabouts. So, there was a lot of self research that we were doing about it. So, Although here I would say – his company, they had a portal where expats go and talk about different things on – whether its about opal card or its about your wife finding a job. I think that was a big thing because that portal has a lot going on about expats. So, in their internal portal, people post that – like my wife is looking for a job, bla bla. They also share experiences very very openly where they talk about x has happened, what’s going on, just very open. They do have meet-ups where people who don’t speak English, they meet up, and wives will meet up, so a lot of that is there. But that’s about it. There’s groups on Facebook and Social media where, I haave seen specifically, like Indians in Sydney, people looking for jobs and stuff. So, I’ve seen those groups as well.

I had to go and get a working with children check done so I got that done, and there was a police check done as well, so got both done, and with that I currently volunteer with 2 groups – one is St Vincent for youth. So basically, they have events planned every month or every 2 months for youth. They only cater to children, who are from a disturbed family. So, refugees or anyone who has domestic violence in the family, or their parents are disturbed. So, they just take this kids to a move, or a park or something and we just have to be with the kids for the day as volunteers. I do that sometimes.

So friends, family, and for me it’s also I think, the lack of work colleagues. I have a very small team here and I don’t have any HR circle here. So, from a work perspective, I do attend a lot of talks and seminars and HR meet-ups to know more people, meet up with agencies and stuff. I try to do that a lot.

Were both currently allowed to drive on our Indian licenses, but we need an Australian licence. If his company applies, we will still have to pay for skills assessment. So that’s the trade-ff as well. And, because were currently not going through any migration lawyer or an agent to do this, this company will go through the lawyer who’s fees also we will have to split on top of the PR cost. I honestly think we will end up spending the same amount if we do it ourselves of if we do it through them.

And when I looked into the program and the CD, particularly in Melbourne, it made sense because… so positive psychology is related to well-being and like good quality of life and Melbourne at that time, had like I don't know, like five years in a row being like the most lovable city in the world and the program… I liked the way it was structured. So, it was it had like more face to face interaction. And that was I was, I was looking for that.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd then did you end up coming into that program or..', '', '', '', 'Do:\\tYeah, so that was like my first choice.

Did you consider and plan your like move? Prior to move?', '', '', '', 'Do:\\tProbably over a year.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd in terms of the year, what were you doing? Like were you just looking at different destinations or visa options or?', '', '', '', 'Do:\\tSo yeah, first I started because I enrolled in both online courses and workshops that I mentioned. Then I started doing some research online looking into programs and see what was available and then finding out like, when to apply, the requirements, which included the English tests and all that. So that was Yeah, maybe one year. Little bit more between like the intention of starting doing moving along that path up to that first time that I came to Melbourne.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHow did you learn about the options that were available to you like what kind of research Did you conduct was it through your own research was it through networks as well?', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tMy own research… going, like internet looking for stuff. And one website led me to the other. And then I started mapping the different programs and like different levels. So there were a couple of diplomas in Chile and Latin America. But then I wanted a master's degree. So, there were like, at the moment four maybe universities offering that and then like looking into that, like, the websites and then looking into the Cities as well. Like, where I, I could visualize myself living, and yeah, and then yeah, so it was by myself, that first stage. Yeah, and then the second stage when I had like everything more clear. I, I got advice from from an education agency. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOh, you did? Yeah. And this was back home the agency or okay. Right. Okay. So we'll talk about that a little bit more later on as well. Tell me about your family and their role in your move.\", '', '', '', \"Do:\\tOkay, so my family is mom and dad. I'm the only daughter so I don't have any brothers or sisters. So, they were really supportive, I guess, especially my dad, because he had the experience, the same experience a long time ago before I was born. So he moved to the states right again. and, and he had, like some great opportunities as well. And my mom came along with him. So he was like, totally supportive of that.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd did you have any family friends or community here before you moved? And did that affect your decision to migrate ', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tSo I think I was lucky last night I had one friend over here. So, at that time, I think he was maybe he he had been living here for a couple of years with his partner and then I became friends with his partner as well. So, and yeah, so that I think helped it made…It made everything more more easier like to because I had a place where to arrive. So I, yeah, the first time that I came here I and I've been living with… had been living with them at different stages of this whole process. So, they have been like a key support.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tOh, that's great. And they're still here. They're still here. Yeah. Okay, great, awesome.

So, it was helpful for me to\", '', 'get into the Facebook groups. So there are several Facebook groups to get information about like basic stuff to get get around here. But as I had my friends as well, here, they had like a lot of advice, like, firsthand. So that Chilean community was helpful, but it was more Secondary I think. The online community.

Or were you kind of set on just studying?', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tjust studying…because the first time that I'm, that I came here, I thought, okay, I'm doing a master's and then I'm going back home. And, in fact, the school that I was working at... So at that time, I thought that I, I could bring what I what I learned from the masters and apply it in that school. And then later on, I realized that it was not the environment. So I had like a permanent contract, and it was a really stable and good job. So, the first time I didn't consider anything else because I was supposed to just go back. And then things changed.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo how long did your visa process take?', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tThe first one, Um, it was it was quick. So, the first time that I came here, it was on a tourist visa. So, to complete an English course, before the Masters, because the proficiency tests, I had like a couple of issues with the score. So, the easiest thing was to come here and take that program. So because of the length of the course I couldn't apply for a student visa. I had to apply for a tourist visa and as well because I came here first to take that course and then went back to Chile, finished my my job for that year, resigned and then came back to study. So this initial visa was probably one week. It was fast. Yeah so I had to take the course at that time of the year which was between July and October. Otherwise because the next program the next course was was almost overlapping with the beginning of the masters and I needed to have like all the paperwork done before the master started because they needed to know whether I was enrolling or not. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd this English course was it a proficiency? Was it a requirement of the course or the visa?', '', '', '', 'Do:\\tThe course the course. Yeah, the masters. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tOkay.

And if so, how?', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tSo yeah, I can be a skilled, I could be considered as a skilled migrant. As I told you before. I'm a clinical psychologist over there, but I haven't practiced here. And it's been a while so I'm aware that my registration, I don't know how it matches. So probably, I would need to take some training to in order to get the certification and go along that pathway. And the other pathway is, I think, as a lecturer or something like that related to to uni. So potentially that could be another pathway. But I don't know how easy, like what what are the real chances of getting like any of those.\", '', '', '', \"M:\\tRight? Okay. Alright, well, we'll move on to nothing. And then all of these kind of questions will discuss a little bit more detail. And so you've got everything here. This recording will continue. So we just talk while we draw. So, okay, so tell me about all of the visa categories. in your mouth, you went through from the point of your initial arrival to your current status, including the wait times, processing times and any bridging visas.\", '', '', '', \"Do:\\tSo, the first visa was a tourist visa and this was in 2016. Okay, so this was July to the first days of October 2016. Okay, so this was our one-week processing time. And after that, I have the student visa 1 and that was from… I think it was granted in December, January, but I got here in February. So this was February 2017 to March 2018. And then this was maybe the same… one week. They were really quick, at least at the beginning. Then from this visa, I had a bridging visa, and this was in March. I don't remember how quick this was. I remember it was very nerve wracking because I didn't know… since like, the first visa, the first student visa was over. And then I went into this bridging visa to get another tourist visa. But because I went through a process from December 2017 until until March, early March to try to get another student visa and in the end I couldn't do it. Because…Because of uni. So yeah, while I was doing the Masters, I decided that I wanted to do a PhD. So I applied while I was doing the masters. And I, I got the response that I was accepted in January. So, my research the PhD is in Education about my research is on yoga and wellbeing. So what I wanted to do I because I knew that I couldn't start the PhD until I got the fundings the scholarship, so that wouldn't happen until the second semester. So, I needed to defer the offer anyway. But I managed to save some money. So, and I wanted to do something in between. And I also… I wanted to stay because that you… Like this whole thing of coming and going, it's like it was no good. So, I… I wanted to do yoga teacher training program. But the thing is that it was tricky because according to the framework of education in Australia it was like going backwards, not forwards can guess it was from a Master's to Diploma, and not at uni, it was just an institute. But anyway, I, I gathered everything that I needed I I went to several migration agents. And the last one, they were like, really supportive. They told me this is really really rare to do. But your letter of intention is really good. Like you have a really clear case and I had the support from my supervisor as well saying that in which ways that would benefit my project. But in the end, there was one document that I needed from the university to present to immigration. And when I went to the office to talk to this person at uni to get that document, she told me that she couldn't give me the document. And and that if I intended to apply for that other course, and I defer the offer for the PhD, I was putting at risk my placement here at the uni, the PhD and I could lose it because I was like, there was like some conditions that they said that I couldn't take any course in between, before starting the PhD. So they basically told me that it was the end. So, I couldn't move along forward with my plan because I was putting at risk, what I really wanted to do and it was harder for me to get another spot for for a PhD, rather than maybe doing the training some other time, during the PhD or afterwards, so I had to change my plans. And this was like, maybe within two or three months that I had to get my head around it. Yeah, and then going into the bridging visa and then going into a tourist visa so I could stay a little bit longer. Mainly because I thought maybe I would be able to stay with a tourist visa if I like maybe stay three months here and then because usually the visas are for like one year and you have to go in and out. So I was trying to figure out how to work on that. Finally, after the bridging visa, they, they they gave me the I go to visa for not three months but two. So that was a tourist visa. And so at that time, I had a partner as well so that as well like motivated me to stay a little bit longer. So, then I stayed here as a tourist, and stayed for a conference, which was on positive education and it was linked with what I was doing. But yeah, so they they granted me a visa for less than three months, which is rare. It's really rare. Yeah. So yeah, and after that, so tourist visa, and that was from from March, I think I went into the bridging visa just for maybe one week. So maybe I think this was around two weeks, waiting. And then I got this one [tourist visa] from March until May 2018. This was two weeks. So, then I went back to Chile after the tourist visa. I had to leave. I couldn't stay anymore. So, I did the Masters with a scholarship and I'm doing the PhD with with a scholarship as well. So, because it's like, crazy expensive, so I didn't have I didn't have the scholarship at that time. So, while I was on the tourist visa, I applied for the scholarship and I got the results in late June while I was back in Chile. So basically waiting to be to hear back about the scholarship. So, when I went back home here between this visa and the visa that I'm now on that was like four months in between. And I left half of my stuff here hoping to come back again [laughs]. Took a leap of faith.  So yeah, and then the student students student visa number number two. So, this was tourist visa number one. And then tourist visa number 2. I got this be granted on August, but I couldn't get here at that time because I had to sort things out for the scholarship first. So I got here on September 2018. And I think that goes until 2023. This was maybe two weeks processing. So this was, like quick, they didn't take too long. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tSo tell me about the commercial services that you used in your migration journey from your first visa to your stage now. And this includes agents lawyers, career consultants, document translation services skill assessment service. Is any language tests or internships or anything that you basically pay for? ', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tOkay, so I didn't pay for anything. So when I…when I got this visa. So I knew what course I wanted to take. And yeah, so I could apply… I could have applied directly to the university but they were charging a fee or something. So, and you know, like being far away it was a little bit can be daunting because like you don't know how what to do. You cant talk to anyone on the phone, you cant physically go there. So this agency it was an education Agency. They’re Australian. So it's called kangaroo. So they’re Australian but they're based in different locations. And then there's another one as well – I cant remember. So since I applied to uni through them, they helped me with everything else. So, they basically helped me complete the visa form and getting all my paperwork organized. And I had the documents already translated. So yeah, so they they are based in another city and …not in my in my hometown city. So yeah, everything like was on the phone and online. Right. So, this was for this one and then I think…yeah so they helped me with the second one. I remember taking a photo at the office like, yay we made it, “another happy student flying to Australia”. So they get paid from the Australian Government and the university. So yeah. So they helped me with this first stage and then…These one's I did it on my own. But since I had another plan here, which didn't work, so I'm just going to bracket it. So, it was going to be student visa but failed for diploma on yoga so here I got I've lost count. Like really like it was so exhausting. I went to so many different migration offices. So, I went to education agencies and migration consultants and finally, one. I cant remember the name, stellar migration I think. So, they were the ones that supported me. They read the documents, I went into the office, I had everything ready, but then the university killed that dream. So, what I finally did was this for that conference. So this was the English course. So, they they helped me with this but then since we didn't we couldn't do anything else. They supported me to apply for the other visa because this is really rare as well, going to the student visa to a tourist visa… they usually don't grant those kind of visas because they want you to just you studied, finished, move on. If you’re not studying again, like move on. So, I'm So but in the end, I actually went into the office again because this is like another story. They they were like not an education agency but a Migration Agency. And because of statistics and things like that, they didn't want to, like, charge me for the service and like, so they told me Yeah, like you can come in to the office, complete the form, like beforehand, and we can check it here and you, with your computer, submit the application. They didn't want to do it. Because if if I got the visa rejected it what it would go into their statistics and they didn't want to mess up that, But they still wanted to help me. Like, they still wanted to help me. So it was weird. But so I went into the office with my computer, and then I submitted the visa. So it is on my own. And that was the first one that I did on my own. And then in Chile this [PhD] one I did it on my on my own as well. All of these ones for from Chile except this one, this one So this was from Australia. I was happy to do it again. I just didn't want to mess it up. Yeah, yeah. So they just helped me like they read the letter. They made suggestions. Like maybe you can put these or not put this. So they gave me suggestions from from an officer, migration officer point of view. Yeah, so like, those kind of things and what documents to support, like upload and stuff like that. Yeah. So it was really helpful in the end.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how did you learn about these services? Like was it through electro example going to that agency Did somebody told you about it?', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tYeah, actually this one, I got it from a friend who got it from another friend. So I first started with education agencies, and then I ended up with a migration agent. So yeah, so this was first and then since this didn't work, I went the other way.  Before the tourist visa number one did an IELTS test. But afterwards, no, because since I already did the masters and it was within that timeframe. were like okay, I completed a higher education degree in English. I still had the I don't know but I like the language skills to go into PhD without Language Proficiency Test.  so yeah they I got an offer letter from the university conditional to the language and then this one that we saw now on like the letter that I got, it was unconditional. So it was like you're welcome to start whenever you you want but with this one year so before this… I it was like the preparation stage maybe. So the prep I I took the the TOEFL not the IELTS. I took it twice. Times two. So the first one I didn't prepare myself I just went because the dates were coming where I had to apply for uni and I just did it. So I got the score that I the overall score that I needed to apply. So the overall score was was okay. But the writing was below the required so it was 25 out of 30 and they required at least 27 so it was almost a perfect score. So, what I did then with this results, I applied for the Master of Applied Positive Psychology. So, then I applied I got the unconditional , no the conditional letter saying that I had to take the test again or doing that English bridging program. So, I took the test again and I had an overall score was much higher. So, the overall score is like 120 I had 110 something like that, but again the writing of the writing again 25 out of 30 Oh, and I and I prepared for that. So, it was insane. I didn’t understood why and because the first time the the report wasn't sent directly to uni. The second time I made sure that the report was sent directly to uni. And because I checked that box, I wasn't able to ask for review. So yeah, I was fucked up. That's another like big industry like, yeah, you make money. Like, I don't remember how much but it's probably like, at least $200 each time. And the course, I don't remember, it was quite expensive. I don't know, but maybe between maybe 2000 and $4,000. So the good thing is that within all this process, because the the, the tests were required for the university, but for the scholarship as well, to demonstrate that I had a decent level of of English to get the scholarship. So, when I when I enrolled in the English course I, I still didn't know if whether I was going to get the scholarship or not. So I again I took a leap of faith and said, Okay, I'm doing this anyway. I was very determined, and I paid from my pocket for that course. And I think it was one week before departing, that I found out that I got the scholarship. So then I got the money refunded for the course. And they covered one ticket because they want to cover a ticket to come here and then returning. There's a lot of things that that that they cover. And yeah, so great. That's why I ended up taking that course.\", '', '', '', 'M:\\tWas that course helpful?', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tSo Yeah, actually, It was helpful, but it was designed for people that really, like need to upskill, and I already had prepared, like my writing skills. And I was feeling really confident with that, but it wasn't reflected in the score. So, when I got here the first time I told myself okay, I'm going to take the most out of this because I'm, I asked for it and it was a big issue at the school where I was working at because I had to ask for a leave of absence for three months. And people didn't like that. So yeah, it was like so hard. So much effort put into that, that I when I arrived here, it was like okay, this course better be good and worth it and I learn something out of it. And then when I when I started, I, I realized that the group that I was in, most of the people needed a lower score. So, they, so they tried to bring you to the, to what the university requires. So, for me it was getting, like 70%. And for the rest of the course of my classmates, it was like 60%. So that the difference between, like my skill set and the skill set of the rest of the group were like, not levelled. And then I got a lot of support from from my teacher. as well. So she tried to adapt some things. And I also try to engage in other stuff so I could really make the most out of the course. But then the problem was that we didn't get enough feedback, because the course was designed like that. And it was really frustrating because I was getting my, my assignments back with nothing on them. And it was like, Yeah, good job. You got 73 Okay, but there's room for improvement or like, again, like I'm, I'm here just for this and it has cost me a lot of effort. So, I want to learn something. I need to know what to Improve and that permeated to my classmates as well. And then I found out about issues that were going on at the institute, like big issues and and then there was like a big, like, we started talking and and, yeah i'm i'm really I get…when I see unfair things going on around me I get like activated, motivated and start doing stuff and I started talking and then, at the end anyone like the..It was clear to me at the end that it was a business. So, they were failing students, just like for example, if they had to pass with a 60, they were fading them with 59 or 58 with no reason, like no proper feedback on how to improve or why they were failing. So, it was very disappointing for me and I remember questioning myself whether I had made the right choice because all over that Institute where the logos from this. University and I got like really paranoid at one point because since I was like, speaking out, and everyone wanted me to speak for them, I thought at one point like, I'm not going to get into this In the course or, or or if this is not working well, maybe the Masters is not good and like, Is it worth it? I got into that whole, like, dilemma. But anyway, then I find out that during that year, the institute had gone back independent. The uni locals were there just for for a while. So that's the story about the course. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tTell me about the role of technology in your journey from the initial stage to your current status. So online research, how did you conduct it? Where did you conduct it?? What kind of resources did you use any use of social media avenues, for example, like Facebook and stuff like that? ', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tSo, so this is preparation just start using colors. So this is the preparation stage. So yeah here was online research mainly, like official websites from uni, mainly, um, and this was from home, my personal computer and I remember there was an open day with this university, and they had online resources like, you could talk to students. I remember Yeah. So they had I don't remember how that was called. But like online chat.  And then I got Yeah, like recommendations of which suburbs to be living, like university life. Yeah. more practical stuff. And then yeah, the official websites for the programs and things like that. Well, okay for the visas obviously you have to use the immiaccount. Social media for what I was telling you about like Facebook mainly, the Chilean group - that's another one of Latin women. The Chilean group organize… they organize a couple of events throughout the year so remember to going to a couple but I'm not really like that engaged in those groups. So, social connections so friends, family, greater community in your migration journey from initial stages to current status. So any people or any, any connections that you want to reflect on your map. So I told you about my friends here so they were actually, well, the friend that I know back from from uni, back from Chile during the preparation process. So yeah, that's my friend that was living in Melbourne. So yeah, this was key because during the preparation process, and then when I got this visa as well, I stayed with them. So, I lived with them together for for three months. Yeah and the other the other day we were talking about this. My friend went back to Chile while I was living here, and I didn't meet his partner until that time. So we were kind of getting to know each other and, and my friend left and he left us both living together and he was like, Okay, get to know each other, be friends fast, and we got along like really, really well. I remember the first day that we were alone, like we we talked for hours like getting to know each other's and yeah, like it was a really good relationship. And then yeah, so I lived with them for three months. And then I went back. So, this is like least gaps, like a lagoon, back to Chile for October, October, November, December, yeah four months. So it was like this like, hopping from here, four months there finished my job and then I realized I wanted to quit and came back - student visa. And here it was really difficult to find a place to move in by myself again and when the student visa expired again my friends appeared along the way and here again lived together for March, April, three months again. Back to Chile - again four months, four and five. So here, and then here Chile, here and here guess what again. This time, October, November, December, January, February – five months. So, they've been like key. And I have other friendships as well. But between like this movements coming back and forth, I've lost connection with some people and it really takes time and effort to reconnect with people that you didn't see over those periods of time and I made friends here but then some of them have gone away. So, it's like, I'm not really seeing anyone from this time from the English course from the map…Yes, I still have friends from the from the masters and they have been as well as a couple of them, like, really supportive along the way. And the people from from the restaurant were at work and that has been another source of support as well. That has saved my life with friends and money. I started as a volunteer but then I started working there and in times of need, It has been key. So I had a partner. So I met my partner while I was studying here. So now it’s ex partner. So I met him here. And then we kept seeing, going through the bridging, through the tourist, and when I went back to Chile, and when I got here, and then it's really messy. And here we broke up - heartbroken. Yeah. So that finished. So, I decided to go into the PhD before knowing him. Like, actually, I was on the whole process of submitting the application when I met him. So, I already like my made by my mind about that. But then he influenced me trying to stay over that period. But it wasn't, he was, wasn't the only reason why I tried to do that. It was just I let go of everything that connected me this Chile at that point - When I resigned my job, I sold my stuff, rented my apartment. So it was like, Okay, I'm releasing everything and I'm just focusing on something here. Yeah. So, but yeah, he totally influenced that process of trying to stay as well, like me trying to make sense of what I wanted to do in between, because I knew that if I… if I was going back, even in like after the first student visa ended, I was going to be in Chile, like transitioning, like no job, and as a psychologist, what what I could have done at the moment was clinical psychology, which is not very ethical to do if you don't know how long you're staying because you're making connections with your clients and you cannot like, abandon them. And I couldn't go like into another job because I knew that I was leaving. So it was kind of messy as well. It was really unstable.

From here what I'm thinking… I know that I can apply for the graduate visa and I think there's a there are two streams. I went to a workshop maybe a couple of months ago about this and and they explained these two streams…i'm not sure i think they need to go to migration agent and that's I have it in my to do list. Yeah. So I can know beforehand what's the best option but I know that with this visa, I should be able to stay the same period of time that I studied, and that would provide, like enough working experience to go into PR. But I don't know. And, and again, like what…What's the best pathway for me to follow? That's still unclear. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tyeah.

And how would you go about it?', '', '', '', \"Do:\\tYeah, I would consider it if I cannot find a pathway here, and I have a better option outside overseas. Yeah, I would consider it. The only country that comes to my mind is Canada? Like? Yeah, like a real, like more tangible option option here because other countries are are getting as closed as Australia. yeah, like just for tourist visa right now the process is much more longer than what I did before. This is like from experience my mom coming here so, the visa took maybe three weeks to come through and it was her first visa so it should have been easier and for a friend the same thing, and they are asking, like a lot of things so if we're tourist visas, they're getting like tougher, what to expect for other visas. don't know what's going to happen. So one challenge that I didn't mention and it arised here on my current visa, and it's related to the Health Cover, insurance, So I was sick in. I got sick at the end of the beginning of April, end of March, and I had to go to hospital and the Health Cover like there this little part like you usually don't read it, or you don't think about these things on the whole process. Because I have had so many other health covers but this one, It hasn't been a year from since the Health Cover has been working for. So, so they don't automatically cover everything for health issues, and there were a lot of things that I didn't know at the time when I had to go to hospital because you're you're sick so you can't like start searching on the internet or talking to someone on the phone so I had to pay money when I when I went to the hospital. So, it is covered but since I haven't been in Australia for it's been less than a year… they, they, they use the right of assessing everything to see whether it is like a condition that pre-existence or if it's a real emergency kind of stuff. And yeah, that's it's been a long process. So, I still from April, I still haven't been refunded the whole amount of money that I paid. That's kind of been kind of stressful as well. Like, on top of being sick and getting recovered. Like this whole uncertainty of Am I going to get paid or not making phone calls, emails and everything. So yeah, that's been challenging as well. \", '', '', '', \"M:\\tHow do you feel after drawing?

But then by the time I finished school, I sort of forgot about it. I completely forgot about it. I was totally in this mindset of oh, I need to do something with my life, like a career or… and so I ended up working first and then I met 2 people, who had, they were much older. And they ended up telling me about their travel experiences and it totally clicked, and I just knew that I had to go to Australia. It’s not just they told me about Australia. Actually one was Canadian and he came to Europe when he was young and the other one had a brother in Australia. But, he was more talking about I should go out and see the world instead of thinking of my career. For me these were significant people.

I love intellectual work. I love intellectual academic environment, but I was in the management at the time, not the research part of it.

I don’t even know if they could have this working holiday thing at the time. But yeah, so in terms of professional life, you know, I was just working, “working” as, you know, just a bit of cleaning, or like housekeeping, at the reception. Some houses would give out free food so I would give out free food to the backpackers and that would gain me a free night. So, everything was way cheaper than now.

I mean I had this – what was the name of this – I had the extension so that was 1 year. Feb 2017, so it would be Feb 2018. And then I had a. Theres something about September. So the longest processing time was the 485. All these study visas, that was in a couple of weeks. But the 485, I think that was like 3 months or so. No sorry, I forgot one visa. Now I know why September. So I submitted September 2017 and when you submit, you have to apply for another visa, and that was the visa that I had. But did I then have the bridging visa? So I extended – that was feb 2017. I think it was 4 years and then I extended but I didn’t need the entire year because I submitted in September and then Im not sure what happened in Sept. I think I might have applied for 485 but then it puts me like, 1.5 years before I get it and that can’t be correct. I had something else in there. Or, I still was on that 1 year extension.

I paid a $100 and it was shit information. Laughs. No – don’t use this guys. They were really shit.  Then commercial actually just came for me again relatively recently when it came to my 485. So I had one consultation, lets say post phd. So at that time I was really sure that the 485 is the best option or not and the second consultation was relatively recent one. It was post 485 because it was about, okay, how do I actually come to PR and that is, I can say is 2018-2019. So I had my IELTS language test on Feb 2018. That’s for the 485. Then I had.. the other IELTS test was in 2011-2012… 2012? I did 2 IELTS. That’s the language. I didn’t do a skills assessment yet. I mean, yeah, So I called them up to find out how to do it, Yes, I will have to. Oh yes, Medical – yes that cost me a lot of money for the 485. Police check, yeah. I mean that was one of the things where I felt a like intimidated. So that’s why I went to a migration agent. So, that’s medical, police checks, passport photos!! Laughs,. Yeah of course, the health insurance. Although personally, I would have the health insurance anyway. So, what else, I had to get an X-ray because I said I was in India so I had to get an X-ray. I think they check if you have TB. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tTell me about technology. ', '', '', '', 'Cl:\\tThat is a good question. I like it. Technology. So well, okay lets start from the information on the website of the ministry of migration, Department of migration. So, I find that is one of the most important sources because, you know, its valid for things. I find a lot of websites are out there but their information is not up to date. For me the landing page was always the department website. Personally, I found it actually quite useful for like, you know, this is the documents you need. I mean, at the end of the day that’s all you want to know, okay so.. I found it relatively easy. What I didn’t find easy was to find out what is my visa I should apply for yeah?. So in terms of once I know which visa I need, then it’s easy to look up what I need to apply for the visa. Okay, so If I don’t know, what is my resource? I would say, like, the newsletters. I actually did read a lot of these newsletters from this site [Acacia]. That’s the only thing that I was happy to get, for my 100 bucks that I paid. Laughs. Skype to migration agent. They are in Sydney but that’s just convenient. But, you know what, I actually found this consultant through Facebook.  So, that means that I posted, umm, On Facebook, I said can anyone recommend me someone. Yes, and that was a good recommendation. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSocial connections?', '', '', '', 'Cl:\\tYeah, so very important. Okay, umm, so who is there. So when it comes to all this study visa stuff, I would say my peers. For me it was like a very very important resource. So ones who went through the process, like, a year older in the process, they have a lot of insights. I also had – so my landlord was a migration agent but he always tried to make me pay for it and I paid so much rent that I never wanted to go to him, like, officially. But he would, Like you know, when he had a good day I’d say… I guess when he had a good day, he felt like… I guess Im a good tenant and I tried to make his life easy. Sometimes, he could feel, I guess, sometimes it came to him to understand that I’m trying to make his life easy, not complaining bla, bla, bla, and then in return he would give me a little bit advice. But that’s, I think that was, when it came to the extension of the 1 year. Umm. Well, umm, when I think about the first time I did this working holiday, I pretty much did this on my own, when I think about. That was all like, phone calls to the Department in Germany. I would just call these guys up, and be like okay how do I do this. Yeah, and then so, I posted this question for recommending someone and I think why I took on the recommendation of this person – I studied with someone back in Germany who’s sister is basically here and she recommended this agent. And, yeah, I felt like it’s a trusted source. And when it comes to. So, it would really make a difference because when it was the study visa it was mostly the PhD peers. I would also say that the university was really useless. I’m saying this because they need to change their thinking about their position; They want to make money, but like International students is for Australia. It’s not specifically for this university. So, university students are a source of income, but they try to withdraw from any responsibility regarding like, helping with migration process. So, and I think its not clear that its sometimes about very simple information that they can provide. I should probably put this on here. So, these were the sources that were good. But let’s also think about those that were lacking or not good. So, university’s graduate school. They are, don’t get me wrong, they are helpful in the framework they work in, but they cannot go beyond. They miss a little bit of a cross perspective sometimes. It’s a delicate topic which I understand. I am aware of this. I also understand that, yeah, I understand it’s a delicate topic. But the university needs to make a decision at some point. I mean, you are model for your students and you can’t stand up for them? So, what is it that you’re teaching to you students? You want employees? There’s no successful employees if you don’t stand up for your values. In the process, there’s always this question, is there a better way? So, I mean, in a way, I’m quite often lonely in this process because, I think social interaction is very important and I get a lot of information from that so it also makes me dependant on it, in a way, like… that’s why this consultant, the second one, is really good because she thinks beyong with me and I feel like, less dependant on the social network. Yes, I do pay money, but I also feel like. It’s a balanced thing – its like oh okay I never heard about this pathway. Its also because, people are not necessarily hiding. Its just like, umm, It’s a different thing. You pay for a consultation and a person really takes time compared to… yeah, let me relate to my question – is there a better way? I relate that to why I pay for it. Is there a better way for skilled migration? I feel like for me, personally, when it came to the study visa extension, everything was relatively smooth. Also the 485 was relatively easy because I could prove that I had the PhD. But then now when it comes to the skilled migration, I feel like, I need. So I actually have colleagues. So, we are moving on to colleagues who help me with this. It’s a little bit, like I said, like, suddenly, I know I have skills but how do I put these skills into this visa system – into the set if skills set by the visa. I am very practical about it. Im like, Okay so this is what they want to see me so what from all these skills I have, whether that’s like, in a certain training, or in a certain job – How does that translate into what their idea of what skill is. How do I translate that? Its exhausting and I also find it a bit ridiculous, but I have to overcome that, overcome my ego and just be practical and say, yeah whatever.

The skills assessment process because theres certain features that define this skill, or this profession and I know I have the skill. I actually worked in this profession for many years. I also have experience beyond that – the defined way. But, it comes down to what the university will certify in terms of working hours and wage. So, that has a double catch because we all know we work more than we actually put on paper. So, that’s one catch and the other catch is, you know, laughs, Its not that im not willing to work more, its how much you get. Yeah, so it’s a process. Im currently in this process. Let me come back to why this first consultation was shit because at the time I was thinking… I was a bit one dimensional. I was okay, I came to Australia to do this PhD… I do this study thing and you know, that’s fine. I do have the awareness of how this migration stuff works. For me it was about living here and I didn’t have the awareness this entire like, skilled migration, politics and all that, yeah. I was naïve and arrogant at the same time, like, why wouldn’t you give me a visa, and so this person was giving me advice. Good advice would have been to say, looking at my CV you can apply for PR right now with this set of skills because this job is on the list and everything is about this list. Your whole life centres around this list. That would have been a good advice and so what happened. I was doing my PhD doing this study thing not having the awareness that I actually, sort of, lose. Of course, I don’t lose, but on paper I sort of lose the experience that I had working for several years in a relatively good position and at the university in Germany. Maybe I should have said, how can I get PR. I was just asking for migration advice and this person; just gave dumb advice I already knew.

So, at the moment, I’m waiting, So I wanna get my… I identified the visa with the help of one of my peers – it’s the skill actually. that I wanna apply for… and I need to get my skills assessed. For that I contacted Vetassess. So various documents ofcourse – My key document, lets just the key ones, not silly ones where you have to show that you did the PhD and all – that’s fine. But, key document would be – okay so I called up Vetassess. For me the question was do they assess the skills or do they assess that I have this title, and they said it’s the skills. I need to show that I have the skills. They said the title doesn’t matter. So the key document would be, demonstrate skills So on the website which says so like, x, y, z skills to show. So Im very practical in my approach so Im like tick tick, yes I have this, no don’t have this. So when I say, I don’t have this, can I maybe show it? Is there something that I am not thinking about that can be shown. So my place, is about ‘University lecturer’ and they have stuff like, you know, sparks class discussion. Of course I’m doing that. Of course, Im holding seminars, I’m attending workshops. So, my key document is – at the university is called ‘statement on service’. On Friday I sent to my employer everything I did at the university and its various jobs. I did for 1 year I did advising for students at all levels, on various questions. Then of course, tutoring. Then of course, there’s a catch to it. The catch is that – so I did PhD research – but they want to see, and I’m not sure how to show that. So, they’re saying a PhD is not a research position that counts for the skill of university lecturers but to say that you’re a university lecturer you need to show that you are doing research. So how can I bring that? So, I need to see how to do that. I think its quite interesting to say that I have a degree which is called Doctor of Philosophy but that’s not a research, like doesn’t demonstrate research skills. So, that’s what I mean by.. you know, needing to understand their understanding of how they see it. I mean at the moment, one thing was, I was paid to help writing for an award application so I will bring this in. I will bring in that yeah I am writing publications from my own research. I’m peer reviewing in journals. So, I tried to get the documentation that I’m doing that. So, what it is is really to, out of, sort of, its like a puzzle. I need to bring in for them, my, sort of, puzzled life as a university lecturer – bring it together and be like -  this is what I’m doing. I’m also going to bring in my, I really have management position from the president’s office for 3 years in Germany so its not, I’m not a 25 year old PhD student or something, nothing against 25 yo.

They were like educated but my dad, he didn’t, because of the history reasons in China, because of peace generation, he didn’t went for, you know, formal education. My mom is the same. And yeah, I think in general the whole fanily, my grandparents generation – even though I was little but I can tell the difference of their impact on our generation. Not on my father’s generation but our generation. What kind of my brother and I – we look for formal education, we want to learn more. My husband is a different story. His dads side is, his dad is a construction worker or manager in some period and his mom coming from a different family background. His family is like, so complicated, I didn’t like that. Like, his parents was always fighting, like I didn’t know that before we were dating or after we were dating for so long to meet his parents. Yeah, anyway, it’s a long story. Furthermore, to the grandparents generation, I think his dads side were very rich. Moms side was quite poor. Like, exactly like my family background. So, maybe that’s a historical coincidence. How we joined to each other, you know, with that baggage’s, I don’t know. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tDid the family have a history of migration?', '', '', '', 'Ju:\\tMy family, they migrated from the North part of China to the middle part of China. It also, in consistence with Chinese history as well. There was like 4 generations before that – there was some political movements, and they moved south. You may want to check the Chinese history. And I think once they move dto this mountain area, I think my dads family, they bought all the land. So, they will settle down in there. But my grandparents generation, they were like super rich and I think they were like, travelling around, yeah but my dad didn’t tell us stories about their generation. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHow did you and husband meet?', '', '', '', 'Ju:\\tWe actually met at high school. Yeah, we went to the same boarding school and then we met there. It was boring and then, you know, both of us – my husband and I were like studying nerds, in Australian terms. But yeah, anyway, we met through students union doing all this kind of crazy students work.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tProfessional background?', '', '', '', 'Ju:\\tI think, its really hard to say. So, I studied English, the language, as my Bachelor degree and then I did some work as a interpreter and translator and then I found a specific area for migration to have foreigners – we call expatriates to China to work, mainly to work. So then, I worked in that area called relocation and migration services, I think for roughly 5 years, before I came to Australia. And now I am doing PhD studies in Migration studies. We can say its consistent, I am still using my professional knowledge about how expatriates migrate and how they adopt to workplace and manage the work-life balance, things like that. All the ideas are coming from that professional background. I think if you look at it that way, I think, I am still using my professional knowledge to this. But at some point, I think this move beyond that as well because at that time it mainly focused at the law, the legal background, the legal regulations in China but now I am moving to another direction – to research the experience. So, in that sense, it’s not so much related to my professional training or professional experience, I think. So I come here in 2015. I think I still worked for the China company for about a year or so We just doing remote – like – working from home from over here. And then, at that time I was pregnant and then I had a leave, a break, a very short break and then I started uni over here and I did my Masters over here and then just go further. I didn’t go for workplace job or something. At that time, I just thought, if I want to change my lifestyle, I may start it from way of thinking. Probably that was wrong. I should just go find a job or do something else and be happy. Laughs. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHow long did you plan/consider the move?', '', '', '', 'Ju:\\tI thnk the idea was probably in our mind roughly for 2 years. It was quite difficult for my husband to make the decision. He was, still is, the only child in his family and he never really got this idea to live so far away from his family. I was the opposite. I was, I travelled a lot within China and I always wanted to find out whats new and have new experiences. So, I kind of persuade him to try different things. So coming to Australia, like, actually, like, when it came to my mind, I said to him that if you don’t want to go, I will go by myself. So, you know, he said, like we are a couple, so we are supposed to be together. So, he said okay – lets do this. So then, after we had a serious talk, I started to do IELTS and then he did IELTS as well. But its just, everything on paperwork, seems to be so good for me. Not until we come we realised that I couldn’t carry on the same profession because of the different regulations of being a migration agent over here. So, that was quite challenging for me actually. But he, he was, he had a small company back in China and he has all this business background and our friends over here offered him a job right away so bingo – and we stayed. We come as business visa and then he was offered a job, and then we start to talk to migration agent, and then, and looking to what kind of visa we can do. But, that’s where the difficulty started. Apparently, its Marketing something – at that time, they need to do a skills assessment something, and he couldn’t pass that and then we thought about other options. So that company hire me as well but because of my professional background, they couldn’t hire me for the regulations even though I have all the knowledge of marketing, sales… I have the experience but it’s just the industry doesn’t fit. I worked for the consultancy company before so I have all this kind of skills. The migration consultancy – and I have management skills because I literally built a team from only myself to 6 people by the time I left the company only in 3 years. I have marketing skills, I basically marketing our migration service, and relocation service, like a lot. And I know, I have sales experience as well, prior to this migration consultancy, I did sales for pad company and steel company as well. I was quite successful in each job. It’s just when we come here, they say no – you cannot just say you have that, and it doesn’t count. I have a degree in English language and then they were saying you have a degree in English Language, and you did marketing and sales and the you did migration consultancy – that’s all migration and that’s a specific industry which doesn’t fit over here. So, we talked so many different options. Its just – nothing works. So, I said, well, okay maybe this is a time to do my Masters because I always wanted to do a Masters. It sounds like the only right move, and also because I was pregnant and yeah.. and now we start to look for student visa and we realised if my husband needs a full-time job, I need to do a Research degree. So, here I am. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tResearch on visa options', '', '', '', 'Ju:\\tOh, we didn’t conduct any research or anything on that. Actually its just, we said, to over friends here we want to come to Australia and have a look. Do you want to.. Can you like, invite us? So they sent us an invitation letter saying you know, because we did business before, and we invited them to come over to have a look. Yeah, so we used that letter to apply. So, they gave us a Business visa, I think we didn’t, at that time we didn’t have to choose which type of visa we need to apply. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tRole of family in migration', '', '', '', 'Ju:\\tMy parents, they actually, they don’t mind. But they had no capacity to help us but they just simply believe that everything I do is right. My brother never concerned anything about my life or work. So, my family, I don’t think they helped or resist I any way. My husband’s family was actually like a push force for us to come because his mom simply like push us to buy a house, have children. I think that’s a last draw on my husbands shoulder to push us to move further , to move far away. For me, I think, I just wanted to maybe change, I just wanted to move away to another city just within China, eventually. And then, yeah, but his mom and dad divorced by that time and that was hard time, like, his mom was super depressed, and she lived with us and she had a really negative effect on me. I think my husband saw that even though I have a really good relationship with my mother in law but she affect me like, mentally, psychologically. And I wasn’t happy. Like, I worked super hard. So my husband barely saw me at home. So I always go early to work and come back like, 9 or 10 at night so yeah, but I don’t know. Maybe that’s a good thing or not. And then, another thing was that she found a partner before we moved. I think she moved to living with him few months before we actually decided we wanted to come because my husband, you know, somebody is looking after her and she seems to be happy. Yeah, so it seems like, her life actually, was big part of my husbands consideration, whether, you know, to move away or not to move away even though at the beginning, like I said earlier, we have 2 years in considering to move but he never actually make up his mind to go but that’s the thing. She moved away and she moved away with her life - find a partner, get a job and they were happy so that means that we can actually have our life. But we didn’t like Shanghai.

Anyway, other, like close friends, they don’t want us to go actually. They feel like, you know youre a good friend. We want our friend to stay together but at that time I thought we are just coming to Australia maybe for a year, we will probably go back. Anyway, we didn’t. And other friends I don’t think we have a lot of friends for networking, or Im not a big fan of social media and FB was banned in China. And, yeah, they are, not so many platforms were available to us to get information. We have education agents in China but they always charge you money to give information which I don’t believe as well and yeah, for us we just thought we have to come to Australia to have a look and search the information by ourselves and also because we speak the language we are so confident we are going to survive here by all means.We have couple of business clients – so before we come here, my husband was doing business with them.

I think they were quite supportive but they didn’t ask then why.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHow long did the initial visa process take?', '', '', '', 'Ju:\\tThe first – the business visa, I think that was quite straight forward. So the friend over here send us the invitation and then we just book the flights; we just showed them our bank account with enough savings to stay in Australia for a year. Yeah, that’s it. It was 1 year visa. It only took us like 4 days. So, I prepare the documents. I think that was maybe spend one day filling the forms and preparing other documentation. That was quite quick. But before we do that, actually I was always thought I may go for further education so I did other process like notarising our degrees, translate that, get them officially transcribed, translate into English and notarise that. We did our ielts test. – that was not required but I prepared that anyway as a just, you know, just, out of my professional experience, you know, that we may need other options and they may request this kind of documentation and if we come to Australia nobody in China has the capacity to help us to do that kind of thing. We even notarise our marriage certificate, our birth certificates. You know everything I can think of as a professional migration consultant, I prepared it. The only thing I didn’t no is the criminal record because that is a timely document. Even if I did that I know that at some point I will do that again.

Even though maybe that doesn’t apply over here but I, it can work for companies who is dealing with Chinese, you know. Im a expert in that kind of background. I just feel like Im skilled. I’m actually really skilled. I have 7 years working experience, 5 years of management skills and I couldn’t transport them over here. Its just a shame. I didn’t actually go out and find a job because of I was pregnant, and I thought you know, if I don’t have a long-term visa maybe it’s kind of challenging for me to find a job.

We have business visa, and then we went to I think bridging visa and then we have student visa and then my daughter was born and then we have bridging visa again because we have to re-apply all 3 together and then we have student visa again and that was a change for student visa (574 to 500). Again we have a bridging visa because we got a new student visa. So here, I think it took us 4 days. This is 2015. And this still 2015. Bridging visa i don’t remember how long... I don’t remember exactly how long. This was granted over here for 3 years – and then this bridging visa because my daughter was born. That was a mistake because when we applied for this student visa we forgot to mention that I was pregnant or something and then and they were saying, after my daughter was born, that you have to apply for another visa, because they were saying you didn’t mention over here that you are expecting a baby. If you know, at that point, you won’t have to go through this process. And we yeah, so these take couple of months I think. So these were granted July, yeah and for 2.5 years until the end of the study and then this was – this was when. I think in May 2018 and then – that was pretty soon. 4 years, I think 4 years visa. That only take I think 2 weeks in between from that bridge visa to student visa. I think that was the quickest one. Over here, this was submit I think in March and was granted in July because they had to review the information for my daughter, I think I had to submit birth certificate, immunisation – I don’t know why they ask for that.

That’s, over here in between. We ask our husbands employer to do this. This is my husband’s side - to do the employer nomination for us because at that time he actually had 2 years working experience in Australia. We thought, you know, maybe we can give it try.

We did IELTS twice for me. My husband did twice as well. We did medical check I think, twice. So students visa – business visa we paid application. So for 2 of us, I think it cost us 2500 rnb so thats $500AUD. And IELTS – in China it was more expensive – I think 400 something in China –  $350. Medical check, so twice for me and then plus Joy. For family its more expensive. I think it cost us for 2 of us – mine was 600 something – we used BUPA, it was quite expensive 600 + 2 + 3 and this is the most expensive one – employer. So student visa we paid $500, employer nomination we paid $2000 and our employer paid $6000 for the training fees, and then student visa – so these two I think is nearly 600. And then here its 600 as well. The good thing for research student is that husband and dependent – they are free so that’s $600 as well. Oh insurance money – that’s the biggest amount and tuition fees. So insurance for the first one for 3 years, I think we paid $15k as a family. Its insane. But now we are paying more. So, for PhD we paid 20000 – insane right.And then tuition fee – Masters - $25000 and then second year its half – I was lucky. Luckily for PhD the tuition fee was waived and we got the scholarship and cover for 1 persons insurance. Childcare – so Joy attending childcare since she was 10 months old. So, now shes 3.5. I think the first year I think its only 10-12 so that’s 1 year old. I think 2000 something. 2nd and 3rd and (roughly per year) – for childcare the same amount as my tuition fee. Its that much. So, every penny we earned, its back in Australia. So we checked our bank account actually. If we look exactly now back to 4 years ago, we have the same saving. So 4 years passed, we spent all the money we earn here and the savings were all gone in between. This savings which is saved gradually, a little bit by the time. That’s insane right!?

I only look at his registration number to look at whether he is a legal registered agent. That’s the only think I looked at. That was a huge mistake. So, looking back I think I should use those kind of networks more wisely. Actually, I think there bare some Chinese migration forums online – I don’t remember what they are called.

I just go, you know, I finish my study and then I would do everything by myself thoroughly and prepare that. I know its that – maybe it’s a mistake as well. Maybe we should think about migration from now as a starting point because it takes time and its constantly changing. I don’t know. Its just that I don’t have time for that. Its more concerning of psychological, emotional management than time consuming actually. I think if I squeeze the time to do research, maybe I can do that.

So then I applied in Monash and that was quite an easy process and after 4 months, I got the scholarship and.. I was like oh, that was like, I wasn’t prepared for it… I wasn’t ready because after getting so many rejections, I was like not expecting that I will get it. But anyways, so then I thought about it for 3 days to decide whether I will take it because I never wanted to go to Australia. I don’t know why. Just because I thought maybe geographically it is too far and Canada – I have other expectations or an image about the education system there compared to Australia. Anyway, I decided, because I didn’t have any other opportunities and I had to do my PhD. Then I started applying for visa and.. it was quite easy for me because I was fully funded and I didn’t need much like bank statements, I already had IELTS – that was part of my journey for applying for different universities. You need to have that. So, I had that and then yeah, I straight away applied for my visa. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHow did you learn about these options?', '', '', 'R:\\tI was working with researchers so one of the things I used to do in my office hours is research for scholarship and explore on Google because… searching for my need.. I had very high expectations that I’ll able to go and be able to do things. I had a friend who was also looking for similar opportunities and he used to tell me why don’t you apply for this, you know, this university has an opportunity and so on. And before that, I mean, I went to England and that was the time when I learnt this thing. I started writing my ideas because I already had some ideas of what I wanted to do, my research, and I showed it to a professor in Bristol and she said yes and I got very excited. She said that you have a great idea and it was very much aligned with her research that was recently published. So, and then she said like, you need to do this.. and.. that. And within a few minutes she refined my proposal, and transformed my idea into a working proposal and she was like yes you can apply here but I am not sure about funding. That was the point when I got excited about this PhD thing and I got some connections as well and I started writing more seriously, and I started applying. So some of the things I found by myself and some my friends and colleagues helped me in looking for. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tFamily', '', '', '', 'R:\\tMy family was very happy about that. My family is like very, I wouldn’t say conservative, they are liberal about my study, and you can go out and have fun but now its your time to get married. So they were quite against my job as well because before me there was no precedent. So they were like shes wasting time. We don’t know why she is doing this job and there are these proposals there. But anyway, I didn’t pay attention to that and I kept looking around for opportunities and I never got any emotional or financial support from my family. So now, when I got it, that was the time when they got excited and said oh she was actually doing something for the past 3 years because before that they did not know what I was doing… whenever I would go to office from 9 to 6, they would say like, what is this! They were like, accepting of this thing that I am moving, I am going and then they started taking pride in me, and told other family members as well that look, she’s doing well. Well, let me just add here that the family that I am talking about is my grandparents and my uncles – my maternal uncle because my parents are – my mother died when I was 13 and my father, I mean, I don’t live with him, we just couldn’t get along well with him so we just moved, I and my sister, we moved to our grandparents house. So I am talking about that family. So, yeah, I mean, then after a lot of struggle, doing everything on my own and trying to find ways and guidance within my group – friends and my family, I think I made it. Now they are quite happy about it that she has done something with her life and we are very proud of her. Otherwise when I was into my job they were just thinking its not something worthy but now they tell this to everyone that oh Ryma is doing really well, shes in Australia or shes doing her PhD and yeah. In terms of support, they didn’t really give any support to me but now they are happy where I ended up and of course then I got married, so they are even more happy.  ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHusband? His role?', '', '', '', 'R:\\tHe is… Actually, the person that I was talking about who helped me in finding these opportunities and convincing me that I can do this, who was my friend that time but now hes my husband. He was very supportive and I think that its his support that I had earlier as well until now due to which I have come this far otherwise I would’ve surrendered. He really supported and even his family. They are all very educated and they didn’t mind that you know, daughter in law is doing something else and going abroad alone, so they didn’t have any issues. One of the person who means a lot to me in this entire process of about 4 to 5 years of my life, the credit goes to my husband.

But, I am not very comfortable with them so but I mean, they connected me with some other people or if I need to ask something or if I ever come to Sydney I can stay with them, with their family and he gave me contacts of his friends who are living in Melbourne and if I need something I can just call them. And one of them is an immigration lawyer as well so he was like oh if you need something, anything, any information, if you plan to stay here, apply for immigration, you can come to me. So that was one. And then when I was deciding to select my accommodation I was quite upset. I was like oh I don’t know where to live and I don’t know what Melbourne is, and because in Melbourne I don’t have any family or friends. Then my husband, he called me. He mentioned that his niece lives here in Melbourne and maybe I can stay with her 1 or 2 weeks while I find my own accommodation. Then he spoke to his niece and she contacted me that okay we can pick you up from the airport and you can come and stay with us as long as you want and in the mean while you can find your own accommodation. So I was like, okay great. So that’s how I developed a few contacts in Melbourne and it was very nice of them because when I arrived here at midnight she came to pick me up with her small kid who was sleepy, and, she still came to pick me up. And due to her I had access to the Pakistani community as well. So she made my early time in Melbourne very nice.

I started applying to universities in 2017. 2017 October I applied and in March I got rejection from all of them and then I applied only in Monash. Before that I applied in Canada only. Then in August I applied in Australia, in one university and October I applied to a university in UK and by that time I got a reply from Australia. So, it took me like almost a year to find an opportunity. That was also hard, like applying and then requesting feedback, like what was wrong with my application, for admissions, especially for North America. They don’t want your proposal for the research... they just want your motivation because they have first 3 years of coursework and then 3 years of research so they want you to come here and learn these courses and then develop a project rather than coming with a proposal. So, I had to write like, many, letters. I still remember on my computer I had like xyz for every university that I applied for like, this university is looking for this, the other is looking for that and I almost spent like a $2000 on just application because there are application fees like $100, oo 90 pounds, or $110. I almost, almost lost $2000 on these applications. Here in Monash there is no fee but for North American and UK universities, I had to pay that.

But before getting this ITA, it was a very, very rigorous and stressful process. IELTS - Oh, my God I had to take is because they demand general IELTS, not academic one.

Because I think I am the kind of person or maybe because of my experiences with family with some with the Pakistani society in general, I always knew that I cannot live in Pakistan. Maybe because of because I think I'm misfit for that society. And also after visiting some countries abroad, I was like, you know, you know, when they say the Pakistani families used to say, Dimagh kharab ho gaya hai iska [she has gone crazy]. So yeah, my dimagh [mind] was actually I mean, I was like, so keenly into this right, I just want to move either to England or any secular society, free society to experience freedom. So yeah, I knew that I I'll have to apply for immigration at some point of my life. But I but I didn't know where, how, when. So when my friend told me that she got PR for Canada. I was like, I got very excited and I asked her to share with me all the details. How can I get into this? Then she shared her experience and she told me it's very easy, it will take six months and it's the cost is very minimum. Otherwise I always thought maybe immigration requires that you have to spend a lot of money and you need to have certain funds to show and I of course I didn't have it. And I knew my family's not going to help me with that as well. So I was like Wow, that's that's quite reasonable because she she she told me that I mean, the application fees is like 50,000 rupees would be $500 Yeah. So I was like yeah, I can manage that. I mean, it's not difficult and then but then she said, I mean, first you need to get your IELTS and then another important thing was that education equivalency report. Education equivalency. It requires So do you have to submit your degrees your transcripts to a Canadian assessment authority? Yeah, something like that. That’s called world education system so they assess your degree and and make a report if equivalency if your masters it is equivalent to Canada's masters or not, and they just generate that report and for immigration we need that report. So yeah, I applied for that. I mean, right this is the process. This is the time when she was telling me that this is this, these are the steps that you have to take to apply for immigration, that was in 2018. But I applied actually recently, like three months ago. So I spent, I think $300 on this process as well. That's called Wes education, equivalency system system. And it did cost me $300. But it was like, I mean, I was like, okay, that's fine. I can do this. And then she said, when you do these things first because you need good score in IELTS, otherwise your points will be very low. So I was like, Okay, I'll do it later. But I was excited, that okay. I mean, within my given means, I can apply for Canadian immigration. But at the same time, I was into that, applying for PhD things as well. So my entire focus was on PhD, not on immigration. But once I got in and I came here, then I started thinking about immigration as well. And within my second, I think, yeah, in March, I came here in February. And in March, I gave my first IELTS exam because I mean, I knew that I'm, I am going to apply for immigration. And because my I got married in January before coming here, and my in laws are in Canada, so for my husband, it's like, yeah, we will have to go to Canada as well. So I mean, let's see if we can stay there or not. But let's apply for immigration, because his family's there too. So yeah, he also motivated me that yes, we can apply. So I am basically the primary applicant and we both applied together. So yeah, so so far, I spend on IELTS, then on my degrees, recently, oh my god, that was horrible - I had to spend $680 for my medical check. That’s too much. And he was like, What the fuck, and in Pakistan that's a cheap, it's like only 200 or 250. dollars. And here it was like 680. And I was like, oh my god. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tAnd how is the process going so far? Like, what else do you have to do now?', '', '', '', \"R:\\tYeah, and during this process, I was also worried about the funds that they demand as a statement that you need to have if you're coming as a couple that you must have almost $18,000 CAD so I was like, Oh, I don't have this much money. And my husband also, I mean, even if we put it together if, I mean together, our funds were not enough. So I was so upset. I was literally so stressed…entire week, I couldn't focus on my proposal and stuff and I was like, What am I going to do? I don't know. But then I again, kept on talking to my friend who got her PR last year. She was like, well, you borrow from your friends from your family because I also did the same. I was just like, I mean, who's gonna give me this much money? I mean, are you serious? She said, I mean, talk to your family. Maybe they'll give you or something. But then, I mean, of course, I didn't talk to my family. So yeah, what I did was because I've also developed some friends here, I have developed some connections… that was through that accommodation finding thing. So I have a friend whom I met in Italy, he connected me with her friend who was doing PhD in Melbourne Uni. So she contacted me and she said, I'm leaving this place. If you want to have this and you can, you can. So, then she also shared some other accommodation options to me. And then I end up meeting an Indian woman who is from Brisbane and her brothers houses here near to the uni’s side. I went to her she was very nice to me and I sort of like connected you know, I felt like oh, I mean, okay, there are people who are very caring, who were very loving. So that was the only time I met her and then we were connected through Facebook and that's it. And then I met her last week as well. And I shared that I'm applying to Canada and I don't know what to do. I mean, I don't have money. I was considering to apply for a loan here. Or I was I didn't know why I never used a credit card. So I was like if I can apply for credit card because she also works for the bank. So she explained everything to me that I may not be eligible for credit card because credit card is only for purchases. If you want to have the other credit card to give you cash, then you need to be either permanent resident or some something else. I was like, Oh, damn, but she offered me that I can give you some money if you just needed to keep it in your bank account. I was like, Oh my god, you saved us… I was like, I mean, I'm so relieved. But still, I mean, even if even after adding her money, I was still, I didn't have enough. So I mean, that day, my another friend who who is doing masters here and she came to my office randomly because we had planned for dinner. So she was she asked me what happened. You look so stressed. I said, I'm and this is the issue I'm having. Without any, you know, expectation…I just shared that this is… this is what's going on in my life. She said, I have money I can give you. Why didn't you ask me? I said, I mean, I never thought about it. I was like, I mean, why why anyone would give me money? I mean, you need I mean, of course, I mean, first you have to have that trust thing, then of course you will transfer money in someone's account. So, she said, No, you can have it because I have this much amount and I'll just pay my fees. I mean, and even then I have sufficient amount. So, if you need it for three, four months, you can have it. So, I was like, Oh my god, I never asked people. I have this kind of thing that I don't ask people that I need help. So yeah, then she helped me. And then, now, my funds are sufficient enough. Yeah. But that entire week was very stressful that I didn't know what I'm going to do. \", '', '', '', 'M:\\tDo you need to have this bank statement for a certain amount of they need to see that this money has been sitting in your account sometime?

If you just take out the money out straight away, that's fine. But once they start the process, they might ask you to submit a fresh statement because they need just a statement a piece of paper, they are not looking into your accounts. I mean, yeah, online and stuff. So, but when they ask to submit it again, then it might create issue for you.

I mean, before submitting my documents I have to pay the immigration fees.

So now I should spend some time in practicing.

Great ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tMotivations?', '', '', '', 'O:\\tSo, the most important factor for me, because I migrated from Nigeria then I moved to UK and then from UK I migrated to Australia. So, I realised that here in Australia, doing a PhD – the government finds it. Whereas, in the UK you need to get like, a student loan and I didn’t want to commit to a loan so – that’s actually the most important reason as to why I migrated to Australia. I wanted to get my PhD. That’s the most important thing. I migrated to UK as a student even though my mom is a citizen there but in UK you need to have gotten in.. or moved down before you were 18. After 18 it becomes a lot difficult. So, I had to apply as a student. But after the student visa, I waited further to get my indefinite leave to stay there forever. But, when I realised that coming to Australia, I’m able to do my PhD for free, I decided to move. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhen did you move to the UK?', '', '', '', 'O:\\t2006. So from 2006, my BSc, I think I finished in 2009, and I did my Masters. I finished in 2010. Then, 2011 2012, I worked a little bit with British Telecom in the UK and that’s when I got the world bank job. So, I moved back to Nigeria because the project was focused on in Nigeria and Kenya. So, I moved down there. So, I was working on the project coz it was funded by the world bank and CFI. CFI is the – they provide aids to African countries on behalf of the British government so I was actually moving from Nigeria to UK but I was actually working closely with Nigeria. So yea, from 2012 to 2015, no 16, I was pretty much in Nigeria. Then I moved back to UK. I did some work but before then, prior to then, I think around 2013, that was when I actually got my PR for Australia. So, because my wife, she actually studied here at The university of Queensland. That’s where she finished. But when she finished reading there, she went back to Nigeria. So, she was the one who told me how beautiful Melbourne was, and I decided to give it a try. So, 2013, that is when I actually applied for the PR, the 189 visa, and I got it in 2013 but they give you 5 years basically, to prepare your properties to sell, etc. After I got it, I came to Melbourne just for like, 2 weeks, just to see whether I liked it and I did. So, I went back to Nigeria then continued my World bank job. Then 2018 – that was when the 5 year period that they gave me was going to expire. So, I decided to move. I think I actually entered Australia 2 days before it was going to expire, and the guy looked at me at the border and was like, “did you actually wait 5 years”. I was like well!! Laughs.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tEthnic background', '', '', '', 'O:\\tWell, I grew up in Nigeria but my undergraduate and my, most of my education from my college years, I started in the UK because my mom went to UK and my dad moved after then.

When I was in BT, I did a little bit of Software Development. But, I did it just for like, a year and then I moved into Business Analyst because I just tired of writing codes. I became a Business Analyst. Then, when I with World Bank in Nigeria I was a BA, but then I moved to be a product owner and product manager, then project manager. So, I was more or less managing the IT intervention. With the WB role, they had different interventions and each of the intervention, they used different IT companies. So, I was like, the IT manager. Even though I do a little bit of Business Analysis – I try to map the processes from A to Z. But I also liked the product owner, the whole signing off any development. I was pretty much the IT manager and also the Business Analyst. That’s always been what I have been doing. So, when I moved down to Australia, the first place where I worked was a government agency in Victoria. It was pretty much similar to what I was doing in Nigeria. What they do in Film Victoria is that they support people from the entertainment industry and the games industry. You submit an idea. You submit online, and if its good enough, the Victorian government will give you money. So, the idea is to bring the movies you wanna shoot, you bring it Victoria. That way, they can create jobs, they give you incentives to bring your productions down to Australia. That way, you give people jobs and train people how to shoot movies, and how you do all these things.  So, it was pretty much similar to what I was doing in Africa where the wold bank supports the business plan. If its good enough, they give you the grant to support your business. So, I was able to fit into that job because, yeah, maybe it’s a different sector, its still the same process. The technology is the same.

Umm, before I applied for it, to be honest, we were dating then and so that was my wife – we were dating, and she was the one who told me about it and I was still a young guy in the UK. I was a bit tired of UK because I was writing codes and it was just all getting a bit boring for me you know; at that stage of my life I just wanted to explore and do something different. So, when she told me, I was like okay maybe I should give it a try. I’ll see how it is. I mean, I’ve been hearing about Australia, but I’ve never dreamt about going there. So, it was just out of, it was…just for fun. Yeah, and within 2 months or 3 months I got it. So, it wasn’t… there wasn’t a drive for me to do it. I just did it out of pleasure and I got it.

So, right now I’m a member and what we do is we just give people advice on how to make their journey. So, I think the forum was very very helpful to a lot of Nigerians trying to migrate to USA, to Canada, to Australia. You know, there are different people there. You just post your questions and they add things. I also used a lot of forums on British expats so another forum. So, most of the research was online. I got most of the things online. I checked online everything they wanted. I ensured I ticked all the boxes they had coz it was the points-based system, so you need to be between a certain age range, you need to have certain level of experience, education etc. So, you get points for all these things.

So, she desperately needed someone to stay. And I was like, oh I wanna go to Australia. She was like, come on, just stay so you can continue paying the mortgage and take care of me. I was like, I’m tired of UK. I just want to do something different. So, well, but they supported me. I was like if I go to Australia, I can get to do my PhD, and spend as little as possible rather than get a loan in the UK. So, yeah, they supported me and assisted me, and whatever I asked them, they were able to assist me. We are 4 boys, and I am the last one. Yeah, so, one of my brothers stays in the UK now.

She was the only one. I like, pretty much only knew about Australia through her. But, when I got the PR, the 5 year gap, I started knowing some friends, yeah I knew the medical doctor in Geelong, now has his own practice, So, I started knowing people bit before I made the application, I did not know anyone. It was from friends. So back I the UK, I think when I started telling people that I’ll be going to Australia. So someone would say, oh my brother is in Australia, I can link you guys up. Oh my friends study in Australia, oh my wife is there. So, I think it started happing because I started telling people that I’ll probably be moving to Australia soon. So that’s pretty much how. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhat about wife?', '', '', '', 'O:\\tSo, the problem is that, like, I’ve learnt that the hard way, I think, information is very important. So, when I applied for it, we were not married. We were just dating. So, I didn’t know that you could actually add, there’s something called the de facto. I didn’t know about that. I just thought that you have to be married. So, I didn’t add her to my application. I actually mentioned that I dated her. I just didn’t add her as an applicant. So, if I had known I would have added her to my application but I didn’t know. So, I applied separately. So, I tried as much as it was possible to try and see if I could add her but I couldn’t. Some people told me that it’s better that I moved down to Australia first, get myself an apartment. It will show that I have something, that I can take care of them. So, at one point, I just thought about maybe I should cancel the one I did and apply a new one and I could include her. But then I was like I don’t wanna go through that whole thing again and spend $6000 again. So I was like, okay I’ll just go first on my own. So now, I started asking questions to people so they can advise me what I should do because, and, honestly that was one of the reasons why I didn’t move. Like, it took me 5 years to move because I was thinking that do I wanna leave all these things that I’m doing, I have a great job at world back, so do I wanna leave that and stay away from my family for more than a year? And for what? And it was not like I am desperate, you know, like, do I wanna go through all this pain? And, I was just like, you know, God wanted me to move to Australia. That’s why I got it very easily. And someone advised that another option for me was to start the whole process again and I was like, no I don’t think so. So, she’s in the UK. She’s just waiting for her visa to come through. She’s on the, coz I’m on the indefinite leave, she’s on that too. It’s like the permanent residence, but it’s not like the PR, like you can stay in the UK for ever, and after a while you can apply for a citizenship. I never got it before I left because I just never cared much about it. As long as it gives you the opportunity to stay forever, so, that was fine by me. And now I don’t care for it too much because I don’t wanna be jumping around. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tVisa availability ', '', '', '', 'O:\\tActually, I did. I looked at different options. There was a state nomination coz then I was. You know, it’s all about the points. Even though, I got the points based on my years of experience, my age, my school, I was lucky to also go to a school, like you get additional points if your school is one of the top universities in the world, you get 5 points – then. I don’t know about now but then, if you school was amongst the top 400 you get extra 5 points. So, yeah, it’s all about information. I went to University Essex and it was in the top so I got additional 5 points for that. I did all the calculations. I needed 65 points. So, I got the 65 points but for you to get nominated – it is based on the number of your points – the higher, the better. So, I said to myself, ah, maybe I just should go and do IELTS coz if I do IELTS, and I pass it, I can get up to 20 PR 10 points. So, the thing is, because Nigeria, we are English speaking and maybe because I was in the UK, I didn’t need it. Coz, I remember I actually asked, and they said I didn’t need it. I don’t know. Again, that’s the question – who needs IELTS? I just know I didn’t need it. I just did it coz I could add more points. I actually did it twice, so crazy!. So basically, you can’t score below 7 in each band. The first time I scored 8 in each band and I scored 6.5 in the listening and that invalidates you. And I was like, are you sure you’re just not trying to make me do it for a second time. So, I did it again and I scored better. So, I scored 10 points more from IELTS. I thought about the state sponsorship but I realised for the state sponsorship, the requirements for IELTS was a bit low so I considered that and one of my friends has a brother who is a medical doctor. He actually went through the state route. I think it was based on, I think it was for Canberra. I think he only recently moved down to Melbourne after he finished the 3 years. So, I thought about that. But, the thought of restricting myself somewhere for 2 years, I don’t like it. I like being free, you know. If I’m tired of Melbourne, I can decide to move down to Sydney. If I’m tired of Sydney, I can decide to go to Canberra. So, I didn’t like the thought of staying somewhere for 2 years. What if I can’t find a job where I am that I like?

I checked also on Tasmania. I also did further research in terms of, which of the states has more IT roles. So, I realised its either Sydney or Melbourne. Most of the other places like Tasmania is more on tourism, hospitality, and that’s not what I do. So, I studied for Sydney and Melbourne. The problem of Sydney is that – when I research between Sydney and Melbourne, which one is better – and everyone was like, ah Sydney is like London. So busy, and everyone is working, and you have to move fast. I didn’t like that vibe. That’s why I got tired of the UK. It was too fast for me. It’s like Nigeria in Lagos, everything is so fast. You need to be street-wise, you need to be so sharp and I don’t like that. I like Melbourne – its relaxed, its laid back. So yeah, I just decided I’ll stay in Melbourne. But its changing. I was telling my friend that when I came in 2014 – it was so calm and I was like “oh I love this place” and when I came in 2018, I’m like, “really! Whats going on here, It’s so busy”.

In Nigeria we have this one-year national youth service. It’s called NYSE. So, basically you serve your country for a year. If you graduate before the age of 40, you need to serve the country. So, the whole idea is to find a way to integrate everyone. So they, if you’re like, from the West – I’m from the West – Lagos, they send you to another region of the country. So, that way you try to understand the cultures, and you get to integrate. It is good but I think that because they want to encourage foreign students so when you come, they give you the liberty to choose where you wanna go. When I went, I just decided that I was gonna choose Abuja. Abuja is the central capital. Its mandatory. Like, for example, the world bank job that I did, I wouldn’t be able to do that if I had not done the NYSE. You must have it. As long as you graduated before the age of 40, you must do the NYSE, else, you can’t hold a position in Nigeria. We do military training for 3 weeks out of the 1 year. Sometimes, they post you at a school – you get to teach people, do ICT stuff, they can post you to hospitals, to banks. So, they can post you anywhere for work for rest 11 months.

When I read on the forums that its very complicated, so I wanted to get as much information as possible. So, I spoke to a lawyer about okay what’s the process for bringing my wife over to Australia. Basically, I already knew the process because I did my research, but I wanted to see if there’s any faster approach to get my wife over. I know you can apply, and it takes 14-19 months, but I thought there should be another way to do it. Unfortunately, now I know that that was one of my biggest mistakes. If I had known that I would have just stuck to my online research because the agent – well – she was gonna do the application for me and she was gonna charge like, $3000 or $4000. She’s actually based in Sydney. When I told her, oh actually I’m a graduate, I can read, I did my PR myself, I can do it myself. So, rather than speaking $3000-4000, I can do it myself. So, she wasn’t very happy about it. So, she probably didn’t give me as much information as she should have given me. For example, when I was concerned that now I am waiting for that 14 months to 19 months, is there any way to bring my wife to come join me temporarily?, and everyone I spoke to – were like, the fact that you’ve applied for her, the partner visa, if you now apply for a visitor visa, the immigration will know that you want this woman to just come and meet you cox they’ll see that application and most likely will reject it. So, then like, mostly what agents advise before was that she should apply for the visitor visa first. When she’s in the country, you apply for the partner visa. That way, she goes into the bridging. The agent I spoke to, the lawyer, she didn’t tell me any of this. I applied last year August so it’s going to be one year. I paid the lawyer for the consultation. I paid $200 for one hour. We have to go to the court to certify all my documents. I also paid to the ACS – I think I paid about $400 to validate my degree. I paid for police reports – I needed from both the UK and Nigeria. Let’s just say 100 pounds. Let’s just say $30 for documents certification. IELTS was like $150 each so $300 for IELTS. Medical was roughly about $200. And then my wife and child had to do this – yeah yeah. In fact, that is what is getting me. Currently, we did the medical and the document certification, and the police report, and I read online that sometimes it only lasts for 12 months. That means, we’ll have to do it again. Coz she, she’s a diplomat, and ambassador. So, she actually stayed in Pakistan, in Islamabad. So, she went through a lot to actually get the police report. She just got it, actually, just last month. So, it took her about 5-6 months to get it. So, when I read online about 12 months, to actually go through that process again, I’m worried – I don’t even wanna think about that, to get that Pakistan one. I mean, the Nigerian and UK were were okay. But the Pakistan one, I don’t wanna go through it again. Yes. So, her degree was actually, between Pakistan and Australia. So, she did 2 years in Pakistan and the third year in Australia. So, I think it was a joint collaboration between the university in Pakistan and the university in Australia. She did IELTS as well because I remember she was bragging that she scored better than me. My daughter also had to do the medicals. She’s 4. Probably I spend about $400 for medical for both of them. What about the fees for the spouse visa? That’s the biggest one. It was $7600. I paid like, $9000 something for my daughter and wife – that’s what I paid. I was like what! I was thinking it was better she applied while I was still in Nigeria. But, most of my friends said it would be difficult because they expect you as a sponsor, to be in Australia, to have settled down. So, that was why we did it this way. The five years that were waiting, maybe we should have done it. But it would have been very difficult. Then I travelled back to UK and Nigeria to go see them because I was missing them. And I’m still thinking of visiting them this year in Christmas as well. That’s expenses – that’s part of it. It’s a lot. It’s not easy.  I think it’s about $2000 for every return journey.

We all chat about the experiences and all that. But, it’s strictly for those who have been successful in their journey to discuss experiences of moving, finding work and so on. It was actually from there that I learnt that I should have actually applied for the partner. There are some people on the group who are actually migration agents, but I didn’t know that.

Everyone has a unique name on Naira Land. So, they’re going to check you out to see that truly you used to comment on the thread, and from there they will add you to the group.

I’m just gonna focus on my project and apply for my DL, get an apartment, you know, just settle in. So, for the first 2 months I didn’t really apply for any jobs. I was just doing the work I had. So, at some point, I started getting a bit bored. Yeah, when I moved here, one of my friends, that someone introduced me to. He was staying in Point cook. So, I stayed in his house for 2-3 months before I got my apartment. So, even though I said I wasn’t gonna apply for a job, but you know in the morning, he was living with his wife, so they both go to their workplace and I’m the only one who’s home. And I was like, uhh, even though I was working on the project, it was just so boring.  So, after about 2 months, I started applying. It was too boring for me – this is gonna kill me. So, I started learning some things. I was getting these rejection emails – oh sorry, we found a better candidate bla bla bla. I was like, I’m very qualified, like, whats happening. I realised that a lot of these companies, if you don’t have local experience, it’s difficult to get a job and I don’t like it because IT is a general language. Whether, it is in India, Pakistan, Nigeria – it is the same code. So, I just, I didn’t understand the whole rationale behind local experience. So as I was doing that, I saw this ad for this charity, they work for vulnerable women and children who are exposed to domestic violence. So, they try to teach them how to defend themselves – so self-awareness and self-defence classes. So, you come to them and then they assess you and realise oh you have issues, they out you through to some self-defence classes to boost your self-confidence.

I advised them how can do things differently, for example they can have a website where people can fill a form, have a social media handle, people can always reach you online rather than come to your physical office. So, I did a lot of research and also helped them define the process. I’m actually still doing it. It’s a pro bono thing so whenever they need my service, I try to help them. I actually got my first job in 3 months and this volunteer work helped coz even when I went for my interview for the government job, I was one the top and it came down to my references. So, I gave them a reference from my World Bank job and mostly Nigeria and UK and they were like, no we need an Australian reference. I’m like, you saw in my CV, I never worked in Australia, how can I give you an Australian reference. So the guy was like, see, he liked me, I was a top applicant, so he said even if it’s a friend. So, I then realised that I can ask the lady from the charity work I am doing. So, she said yes, shes gonna be my reference. So they used her and one of my UK references.

So, when I got here, like I told you, I was getting a lot of rejection letters. So, I read online that sometimes you just go on LinkedIn and if you see someone, if you either worked together or went to the same university, you can just send a message to the person, chat with them and maybe have a coffee, try to see if they have an opening in their office and ask them to be a referral. So, I actually did that. The first person I met – I saw an opening in Commonwealth bank. They guy was from Nigeria and worked in Commbank so I was like hey bro, whats up man, can you just be a referral, and he said no he can’t do that. I was like why, and he was like coz he doesn’t know me. I was like, hey it’s not a reference, its just a referral – like you’re the one telling me to apply for this job. He said, yeah, he doesn’t feel comfortable. I was surprised, I was really really disappointed. But anyway, I actually met another guy. He’s a consultant. Hes a Nigerian – hes into ML. I saw him on Social media, and I messaged him and he was like yeah, come meet me for a coffee. So, I sat down with him and he just told me, like oh, the way you did your CV, it’s too – like in Australia, they wanna see your acheivements, like, whatever you have achieved. My CV was just like I worked there, this is what I did. So, I didn’t have a proper CV. So, while we were having this discussion, he realised that I was very good with some of the tools that they currently used in Australia – like CRM, tableau, but on my CV it wasn’t there. So, he was like you need to put all that on your CV, they like to see all that stuff here. So, I had to redo my CV and I ensured that I listed all those things, and yeah I got the job. So, social media mostly helped me after I moved here. You know, I always tell people that, information is the most important thing that anyone can have. You know why? You know when I moved down to Melbourne, I didn’t buy a car. It was only me so I was always jumping on the bus. And at some point I was like, my wife and my daughter will join me so I should just get a car. It took me about 6-7 months to get a car and the only reason was, I didn’t want to go through doing the driving test, and all that. I know I can drive. The guy I stayed with when I moved here told me that I need to do my driving test and all that. So, one day, I was just browsing online, and I realised that if you have a UK license, just take it there they can just swap it. Just that. I didn’t know that because the guy told me I have to go through the whole driving test. And I was like oh, I don’t wanna do that. I just wanna focus on my job, on my life, bring my family down. I don’t wanna go through this driving test. I can always just on the bus or tram and you know the funny thing, that this guy – so initially I thought oh maybe he doesn’t know this because he’s never been to the UK. But, his wife is actually American, so he told her the same thing. So, I took my UK licence and they swapped it, and gave me the Australian license. And I called him and said listen man, don’t tell your wife to go. And he was still arguing with me that No! that’s not possible. I just told him I just did it. He was telling me that he’s been living in Australia for 10 years and he knows. So, then the wife called me, and I told her that just pay the application fee, and they will change it. So, it was then I realised that information is very important. Sometimes, don’t just listen to what other people say, even if the person has been here for 10 years. Just research yourself, go online, ask questions. I can add LinkedIn on the map. ', '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tImmigration policies', '', '', '', 'O:\\tI think the partner visa is crap. I mean, if theres, let me tell you something. I think about 2 months ago I sent an email to the MP – the local MP and like, how can you keep a family away for 2 years – a partner? That is breaking the whole family itself. What is the purpose of it. They were like, they look at it to validate if the marriage is genuine because theres a lot of scam. I was like, yeah but like, honestly, I’m talking to here one-on-one. Theres some arguments I am having with my wife and when I was in the UK and Nigeria with her, I didn’t have these arguments in her. But now, because of this visa theres a lot of frustration, like shes the only one taking care of the child, shes so tired coz she needs to work, shes got her own business – she does cupcakes, she takes the child to school, she works, does the housework, sometimes these little, little things, we have started arguing about it. When I was with her, we never argued so much. So, it actually causes a lot of triggers on small things, and I don’t understand why these guys don’t think about that. You are actually breaking a family with all these checks – youre breaking my family. For me, that is the part which is not fair, its not right. If I had known, honestly, that it was gonna be this difficult, I probably wouldn’t have moved to Australia. I would have just stayed in the UK. Why would I not want to stay with my family, my daughter, she’s just 3 years old. Its torture. I understand like yeah, okay maybe there’s a lot of scam going on, or things like arranged marriages, I understand. But, you cant punish genuine people. No matter what you tell me, when you keep families, especially newly married or young couple away fro so long, there is no way you are not breaking, like somehow, you are breaking their relationship. You are breaking the bond. You end up saying things to each other, yeah you’re angry but you still said it. And for me that’s the most, I don’t think it’s fair, and honestly to be frank with you, a lot of people I spoke to, they always think that Australia is more racist than other places, and its one of the reasons they feel that, especially when you’re from Africa, they feel that you’re not genuine. British people who apply for partner visas, some of them, they get it 4-5 or 6 months. So, why would someone from India, Pakistan, Nigeria spend 18 months – for what! Why? Its just nor fair. I know of people who applied from the UK and got it within 4-5 months. So, why should it be different – just because someone applied it from Africa or Asia. I don’t think its right. I got so frustrated; I actually wrote a letter to the MP. I was like listen man, if you don’t want people to come, how can you tell me, I’m an honest person, I came here, I work here, I pay my taxes. And the little thing, for me to bring my family, I can’t even enjoy it. Think about it – I resigned from my job, I decided to make the move thinking that would improve my life and be good for my family, and now I have to wait for 2 years to see them.

That is what brought me to Australia. If I live here, and I don’t achieve it, I think I would have failed. I have to do it. That’s why I came.

Again, that’s one of the pain I am feeling with this kind of migration – it makes things difficult for me for planning. I love planning maybe because I’m a business analyst. I have to have a process in my head before I do anything. So, the whole migration stuff – because my wife if not here. It’s a bit difficult to make a definite plan. For example, I would have gotten a mortgage by now. My bank already offered me a loan to buy a house, but I don’t wanna do anything until my wife comes.

You weigh the options and then it’s kind of a given that you will probably be moving countries every time you get a different appointment. So, I suppose it’s a little bit idiomatic in that sense. The main factors we considered at the time – there were a few things. So, first of all, the job was great. So, I really wanted to do the thing. So, this was basically when I was still in my career of astronomy. I had already done a Postdoc in the US and I was looking for the next step. We didn’t really want to stay in the US and there were a few factors – a few reasons for that, and we were looking for places that had a few of the things that kind of annoyed us about living in the US. One of the – so there are a few logistical reasons – very mundane things, not really emotional things. There was, first of all, there’s 2 of us and there’s one job offer. My wife didn’t have a job offer so were like okay, what is a place that won’t hassle her for employment. And, at the time Australia was possibly the only place - that where the spouse visa was completely free. You could do whatever you like, you know, work. We would’ve had that only in the EU otherwise because I’m an EU citizen. We could go to the EU and me and my wife could work there – just defacto. No hassle. But, in other places that’s not the case. In other places that we’ve lived even, that’s not the case. So, yeah weren’t looking at going back to Europe then. We were looking for another adventure. So, in here it was possible for my wife to get a job. So, that worked really well. Another thing that I considered at the time was basically long-term career stuff. This is previous career, obviously in science. So, I was thinking, you know, what is the place where there is decent Science funding, and at the time it was very good. You know 2012 – there were all these fellowships, they were open to everybody. Different discussion – obviously that changed after we got here. So, I think the facts at the time were career specific, opportunities for both of us, a place where cost of living wouldn’t be a huge problem for a Postdoc salary. In the short term, we didn’t know what our plans would be for the long-term. Obviously, Postdocs don’t make enough to live here long-term, buy houses, and all that stuff but for a 3-year contract it seemed fantastic and it was very good. And then, there were some other considerations that were – like once all these boxes were ticked then we thought about bigger things, you know, what are the – I realised, as I say this, it was so nerdy, so statistically kind of informed. So, everything was looking at like society stats. What is the Gini coefficient in Australian society like, things like that, coz – slight tangent but we lived in Chile for a while. It was a wonderful experience to live but the inequality is something that bothered me every day there. Even though our jobs were the jobs that were creating more equality, it was still very difficult to live in a place like that. So, I didn’t want to move to a place that, again, there would be so much inequality. So, that was a consideration and those kind of things. That’s the stuff that pops to mind. ', '', '', '', '', '', 'M:\\tWhere is home?', '', '', '', 'H:\\tGreece. But I lived in Chile, in the UK for and US. It was all for Science. So, I went to the UK to study. Then, I went to Chile to do some extra projects for my PhD. Then I was in the US for a postdoc and UK for a postdoc. So, it was absolutely all for the Science career. Astrophysics. Now, [career] its so-called Data Science. So, umm, when was this, 4 years ago? Maybe May-ish, April, something like that of 15.\\xa0I moved. Yeah, at that point everything changed. Now, the observatory I was working for doesn’t even exist anymore. It was a really famous observatory – like world famous research facility in Sydney. The headquarters were in Sydney. And, they disbanded the observatory. Thankfully, The Australian National University took over the telescope. So, the telescope is gone into good use. But, yeah, the shorter version of it is, the government changed a year after I moved, and everything changed. It was like, where there were all these opportunities, so much funding, the funding was cut. Where there were fellowships, the fellowship programs were cut and the ones that were maintained were only open to Australian citizens. So, I wasn’t eligible to apply for anything. So, essentially professorships maybe. I would’ve been eligible for professorships, but it wasn’t what I wanted to do. I wanted to be a researcher. So, it’s just, everything changed overnight. That was pretty traumatic. So, then I had to pretty much – what we thought at the time was – okay, do we want to move countries again, and just have to kind of start over once again, or do we like it here enough to just stick around and find another job? Which was obviously a huge decision you know. I decided to me an astronomer when I was 8 years old, so did Milly. That’s like 25 years of decision making at that point. Everything is geared toward being an astronomer and remaining in this field. So, to switch away from that was quite a big deal. I lost track of the original question. [laughs]. So, current profession, yeah. So, 2015 when my postdoc was about to expire and then I looked for another job and Data Science was kind of, the obvious switch coz a lot of places were hiring at the time, and it was becoming very trendy, and it was basically a job where I could do the data analysis, do the research, which is what I wanted to do in Astronomy, but would kind of, have to give up to be a professor anyway. So, then I worked at another company as a Data Scientist. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tPlanning', '', '', '', 'H:\\tYeah, there was a fair bit. The way it works in Astronomy – you get – there are so few jobs. I mean, the whole global community of Astronomers is about 5000 people. That’s it. We kind of all know each other. So, when you apply for jobs, it’s very unlikely that you get more than one offer, if you get any. So, you keep looking until you get an offer. So, I had yeah, there was an opportunity to stay in the US, go to California. I wasn’t thrilled about the specifics of that role, that Postdoc. And then, the opportunity to come here. And then, also I could’ve just kept looking. When this came about, it just sounded very exciting. So, there was a lot of consideration obviously. But, kind of the appeal of, you know – let’s just go to Australia for 3 years – great, let’s just do that. That really shortened the consideration time because we thought it would be a fun adventure. I’d never been here but, you know, people seem to have fun here, and lot of astronomers were coming here, and they would all just say, oh, you know, it’s a wonderful place. It seems like a good place to be. So, that kind of, shortened the decision time. But yes, there was a lot of consideration – the main consideration was, the main kind of rival in that thing was, trying to figure out something in Canada because we have a lot of colleagues there, and Canada was – the stuff that we starting going through after we got here – Canada has starting going through then. So, they had started restricting fellowships to citizens and things like that. So, we were very close to getting jobs in Victoria in Canada, which was what we really wanted at the time. It was our absolute dream and then the government changed there, and we couldn’t do that. So, with a few doors closing around the world, that also shortened the decision time. There just weren’t that many options. So, once things was, kind of a clear favourite, then we took a few weeks to figure out, really, just the appeal was there, but were just trying to figure out –just the logistics of it all. You know, astronomers are not like, money bag kind of people. It was extremely difficult to go through the process of how much cost and to get here, and make sure, that there’s a bank account, and there’s money somewhere – it was a big freak out.

I trust somebody, some expert to tell me what to do, and I find out a year later that it was a terrible decision. It was completely wrong, and everything is just the worst-case scenario. I found out pretty much the day I landed here from one of my colleagues at ANU that – umm – this is a very high up person. He has a direct line to immigration case worker, whatever it’s called. When he wants to bring in somebody from abroad, he picks up the phone and gets that one person on the phone and says, I have a Postdoc, this is a brilliant person, and I need PR. That’s how it worked. Apparently. Yeah. That’s not supposed to happen. But that’s the story I was told. Yeah so, getting people on PR was possible but to me it was presented as absolutely, the only option you have is the 457 visa and then bla bla bla bla. So, Postdocs there were her for – I don’t know how that worked because on paper, that shouldn’t because there’s not ongoing employment. Postdocs are usually fixed term appointment.

So, in the beginning it was – oh this is only for 3 years and then ah we’ll see, we’ll probably go back to Europe because that’s a sensible thing to do. It hasn’t gone that way but at the time, I didn’t think so much about my family back home because I thought this was just a short-term thing and we’ll just get to experience it and probably move somewhere else close to home. Not to Greece. It was never a consideration, just realistically, it was never like that. But, yeah, it wasn’t, so I guess it was definitely part of the consideration.

Maybe a little bit less, we applied for PR as, what was the path, I can’t remember what it was called – something like direct entry on employer sponsorship and all that stuff. This must have been the direct entry stream or something. 187, maybe. Then we applied for 187 I think at Envizi.

So, let’s see, ah, this was also so much money bags because it went from like, $300 to $2000. This was out of pocket because this was for a government department. They were explicitly not allowed to pay for someone’s immigration expenses. They covered their side but then your visa expenses, they weren’t allowed to cover. When we came here the visa application was $300 and when we did the renewal, it had changed to $2000. I remember that clearly because $2000 to a Postdoc is an insane amount of money.

Last time I made a little mental value of how much this has cost us over the years, it was about $20,000 that we had spent already on immigration. And this doesn’t count the money that the lawyers here are gonna charge – I think that’s gonna be like 5-6k as well for the lawyers here. And, I also haven’t tallied the cost of a bunch of translations and things I needed to do. So up until essentially, up until we changed to the commercial sector, we didn’t really use, essentially any services, we did everything ourselves because of course, Postdoc pay. Up until this point I don’t even think I had to translate anything. So, one side of it is that it was very favourable conditions in academia because essentially, the university vouches for you. Back then, the university was allowed to say, look this person has written academic papers, they can speak English, no language tests, Bye, and they were given that think. Whereas, I don’t think they can do that anymore. In the commercial sector they don’t. It was either when I transferred my visa or when I applied, ah yes, so when I applied for the 187, I had to get language tests, that was IELTS, which was basically a scam as far as I can tell. There’s just one provider, and they just make up a grade that doesn’t give you the top tier English. I’ve taken the test 3 times and I’ve had different grades each time. I’ve asked for remarks and they say, oh, I don’t know, this is your mark. IELTS also cost probably $2000 or something. I took the test 3 times and it expired I guess, and then I had to get a remark because they gave me a ridiculous mark and said my reading comprehension wasn’t good. And, there were mistakes in the questions. I was reading the test and there was a 2-part question and they said, basically, the structure of the question was assertion – based on this assertion tell me this. The assertion was incorrect. You read the question and the assertion is incorrect. They say “these researchers are performing investigations on these things”. No, other researcher in you article are doing this investigation. How do I answer this question? It’s gonna be wrong. It’s a scam. I have very strong opinions about this. I mean, I spoke to so many people while we were waiting. And it’s not only that. I mean, it’s a scam, there’s only one provider, obviously there’s politicians getting bribes here. Like, I come from a country where people tell you there’s a bribe. Here, they don’t tell you. But, it’s a bribe. There’s only one provider. But they were testing people – I was chatting to a guy from South Africa who obviously grew up speaking English. He was an Anglo-South African and he needed the test to do a PhD. To start a PhD program. Oh, don’t get me started on IELTS. Many emotions there. They’re also so rude. All the staff were horrifically rude. I mean, you can’t take a water bottle in there. You can’t go to the bathroom for 5 hours. I mean who do these people think they are? It feels as though, all the times I was randomly detained in the US, they put you in a little room with a small TV with Fox news playing, and there’s no remote, and it’s on high you try to just reach the off button. That’s the feeling I got in the IELTS room. It’s quite detention-y. You feel like a criminal. So, okay, up until, the whole academic time, no commercial services used. We do everything ourselves. When they transferred the 457 visa, here there’s a migration agent but the company paid for that. So, this is Envizi. Then, with the VETASSESS, again, there’s a migration agent, and then I and to pay for VETASSESS myself. I had to take the IELTS test, which also the agent didn’t realise I had to do until literally a week before the deadline which was stressful. Actually, at this point Physicist was on the list but the migration agent told me it wasn’t an option. So, I asked, can I do a self-sponsored thing? He said, normally you would but you don’t have a profession that doesn’t allow you to do that. That was incorrect completely. I mean, I would’ve had a PR years ago – 4 years ago and then, at the same time my actual profession at the time, which was an Analyst, I wasn’t actually, on paper, I wasn’t qualified as an Analyst for the points system. So, I couldn’t apply under some archaic title – operations analyst or something from the 80’s. That would be the profession but for that you need a degree in that, which doesn’t exist by the way. Or, you would need something like 2 years of practice in that field but at that time my whatever, 10 or 12 years of Physics didn’t count because I wasn’t an Analyst on paper. So, I was eligible for this direct entry, 187 thing, whatever it was. That was the only thing at the time. They made it impossible for me to apply as a skilled worker independently as an Analyst even when I had 2 years because they changed the rules. So, at that point, this is where the big money comes in. There’s also a lot of money for translations here. Not education – that was all in English. But, birth certificate, things like that. And of course, the agent is paid. Police checks, yeah, of course from each country. Thank God I didn’t need one from Chile, because technically I didn’t live there. I wasn’t there, I didn’t have a visa there. I was just visiting there for my research and I had a time limit – like, I wasn’t there for a year. But, my wife was, which is a bundle of joy now, a current blocker for our PR. They are asking for documents that they know cannot be obtained. Police checks from Chile. When my wife lived there – we actually met there – she was a diplomat, on a diplomatic visa. Scientists in the government agency where she was working there get a diplomatic visa, the car, and the house, the whole shabang. What that means is 2 things. There is no trace of you in police records. They don’t allow to have a trace because you’re a diplomat unless you’ve done some serious crimes, I guess. I don’t know what kind of treaties are in place for that. But, yeah, and then. But, when you leave the country, you have to relinquish your ID – your super-duper special ID that you can flash to people to get out of parking violations I guess, I don’t know why people use that. So on one hand you don’t have police records, on the other you almost didn’t exist there apart from your employers assertion that this person was a diplomat here. So, now they know – like, theyre asking for a photocopy of her ID card – the special ID card. They know that we can’t get that. I don’t know what’s gonna happen but this is the current stage that we’re in. We have a letter from her employer, signed, like, everything, with like the official seal. This is an international treaty organisation that’s putting a stamp on a piece of paper. That already was difficult to get. No, not enough. They wanted to get every bit of communication to prove that we’ve tried to do this. They wanted every bit of written communication between us and the people who tried to help us out in Chile with a statutory declaration and everything. Actually, they didn’t ask for that. Our lawyer said, do that and it will probably work, and they’ve been sitting with that for 3 months now. They’ve asked for it twice. You provided this but you didn’t provide this. I was like, umm, you didn’t read the thing we provided. That’s very reassuring. So, we’ve essentially the same documents twice because they asked for it twice. So, anyway, now all of these intermediate things are peppered with these delightful experiences of going to the lawyers. They’re very good – the lawyers that we use here – thankfully. Unlike the migration agent at the previous place. So, I’ve got to the lawyers several times with a stack of papers that have costed thousands of dollars to precure, dropping them on the desk, and they go, literally this morning everything changed, or literally, 3 days ago everything changed. So, I’m beginning to slowly slip into conspiratorial thinking because they know its gonna take about 6 months to get your documents. Even if you move at the fastest possible pace, that’s how long it takes to get a document from another country. So, they change everything every 6 months. At some point - I didn’t actually finish this project – I started writing an algorithm coz they do have to by law, post everything on their website right? So, I would parse through all those documents and see how much stuff changed and how frequently it changes. I should have finished that project. I never did. I got too frustrated with the whole process. So yeah, it changes basically frequently enough that you just have no chance of getting the document together. That’s our experience with PR here in the last one year.  So, what else have we paid for? Medical tests. Terrible health insurance. I had to go to the hospital a few months ago. I had a kidney stone, and I had to go to the hospital. This is the only one option that we have for health insurance with the 457 visa. They won’t even pay for the hospital. What do you think, I got kidney stones for fun? The most recent message is like, oh you should claim that on Medicare. You don’t understand what you do, do you? I’m sure they’re other things – oh notarizing documents also. Also, that’s more or less the things that cost money. Those processes had to be done multiple times. I’ve got like 5 FBI checks because it takes them so long to process things, I need to go get another one just in case. I’ve got probably 4 UK police checks. I’ve got like, a dozen AFP police checks. Thankfully, the FBI changed their system and you can do it online now. But it used to be, you had to go, get your fingerprints done, actually no, that’s still the case. The police officer has to take your fingerprints at the precinct, and they have to send the envelope out. So, they have to do all these logistics. So it could take anywhere between 6 and 9 months to actually issue the certificate. So in 4 months, we would reapply because we thought that by the time the case worker got to the case, we would go over the year and need a new one. So, go to the police station, get the police check done, then the FBI sends a piece of paper through Auspost that probably gets lost, and they say, oh your pinky is not visible. Send a new one. Like this, is 1890 or something. But thankfully they changed this in the last 6 months and the only complicated part is the finger printing. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tFriends, family, greater community?', '', '', '', 'H:\\tSo, I’ve never been surrounded by mostly Australians the whole time I’ve live here. The very few good scientists, or scientists that Australia produces go abroad mostly. The majority of Scientists that are trained here don’t work here. So, the import is how they make up for that shortfall. So, at the observatory, there was my boss and one colleague and that’s it. That’s all the Australian’s. Apart from that, everyone else, all the other postdocs, apart from that one guy, were from all over the place. Then when I moved to Envizi, I think there were only 2 Australians among 25 other people there. I mean, Australian born Australians. No, Actually, the 2 people Im thinking about came here as children. I don’t think anyone was born here in Australia. So, very international. So, technology sector, it was very international. Now, were beginning to produce the talent here, beginning. Here, is the same. We have junior developers who are Australians and some junior designers, I guess but mostly everybody is from abroad. All the analysts I work with, there’s quite a few people in the Analytics department, umm, were from all over the place. And then, somehow, even the things that we did as pastime hobbies, whatever, we were part of a couple of Karate, martial arts communities, and even those communities were all immigrants. The community on Deewhy where there were 3 Australian and everybody else were imports like us including the instructors. The people that started the community are from South Africa. We are actually really good friends. The one that we go to now, they are from Peru. So, somehow, not because we sought out immigrant communities, but the majority of people around us are immigrants. At most, they the children of immigrants. I don’t know that I know any Australians who are not the children of immigrants. Apart from a couple of people in – when you live on the North Shore – that’s the only place where weve met people who’s parents were born – in fact, No, nobody’s parents were born in Australia. I don’t know anybody who’s parents were born here. I don’t think I’ve met anybody. And I never tried for that to happen. I mean obviously we seek out things but not at work, not when you’re at a Karate class. This is gonna sound really mean and kind of, this is not gonna sound very good. But I don’t -  I can’t think of many fundamentally Australian activities that I wanna be a part of. Like, what am I gonna do? I don’t gamble, I don’t surf, I don’t drink heavily, like, what am I gonna do. Like, those are fundamentally Australian, Australian things. Like, I don’t do these things. So, the things that I do are – and I know how pretentious and snobbish this is gonna sound – but yea, all of the things that I do, their foundation, their roots are in, essentially, old world culture. Is this thing a painting? – Im interested. Does this thing involve music? – Im interested. But those are not things that originate here. Those are not the things that people do here. And I know how snobbish that sounds, and I don’t mean it to be this way. I’m not a snob about Australia. Australia is a great place. I’m just not interested in those things. It’s like golf. I know difficult. I know, it’s kind of amazing. I just don’t care. I don’t care if golf is difficult. I still don’t find it interesting or important. So, the past few experiences have been handled by lawyers, so I haven’t done much of that. The first time, my wife, the saint that she is, she took care of that. She was like, you know, you got the job, the paperwork – I’ll take care of that which is also a very nice thing. Also, I freak out about paperwork. She’s much better at that. So, yeah, so mili did that. The first time, it didn’t feel that daunting. The second time when we were renewing our visa at the observatory, I think it was significantly more complicated. I seem to remember that. And then the lawyers took care of it. So, all I had to do is fill out their form, and then they went and adapted that into the official form. Anytime I had to look up something for that, it was like reading Sanskrit. It was just, I had no idea what’s going on. So, I definitely relied on the lawyers. The thing is that I relied on migration agents too much and I thought that Im not gonna ask everybody how they did these things because im not gonna bother them because we have this expert. Ofcourse, when I brought things up with people because they would ask, hey how’s it going with PR, did you get it? So, after we applied for this 187, and spent all this money, I remember having a drink with this friend of mine and he asked a question and I was like you know, Physicist is not on the list and we had to do all this other stuff. He says what are you talking about. Physicist is absolutely on the list and he just goes on his phone and goes here it is – it’s on the list. I was just gonna jump of the roof coz it was so expensive and so complicated and it handcuffed me to my employer which I didnt like. I was very happy there at the time but I did not like the idea at all of being tied to an employer because – this is not what happened, everybody was really nice – but as soon as they know that you’re handcuffed there, they can do whatever they like, and what are you gonna do, leave? It is the same situation here but there was no other option for me. This is the only way we could apply for PR. There was absolutely no other choice. We were gonna apply again, this time last year, July last year is when I had all the requisites and points and all the requirements, and that’s when they took the operations analyst, the something something off the list. So, I didn’t qualify. Now they, I think they said, that they would bring in this tech worker category, but I don’t think they did that, and I would absolutely qualify under that if they were no bring it in. And also, actually, one other thing changed in the meantime. So my wife also changed from Astronomy around the same time as I did. Actually no, about a year later, and she wanted to do technical writing. They changed her profession and bumped it down to the short-term list. So, we couldn’t apply through her, and she’s an American citizen so we would’ve gotten much better treatment. But, she’s no longer eligible for PR because technical writer was bumped down to the 2-year list.

Part of that is that there are all these migration agents who are fishing for clients and they will only give you half-truth. So, you’re looking for a yes or no answer to a very simple question and they say yes and no. So, you pay them some money for consultation on the phone. Oh, actually, this reminds me, we did use another migration agent at some point because I completely lost trust in migration agent in my previous company. So, we actually did pay a bunch of money to another migration agent to confirm what this person was doing because we lost trust completely. And this was through a network, our freiemds who are also immigrants told us this person, she knows everything. That was very good. We were seeking advice about a few things, very confidentially – we were asking if we apply through an employer and leave the day the PR happens, what’s the worst-case scenario? Do we get our PR taken away, do we get deported, what’s gonna happen? So, we were seeking an answer to that question. And again, nobody has the answer to that really.

NZ is what we thought Australia is, I think, for a number of reasons. Plenty of disillusionment but that’s not really a reason. That would be a silly reason to move. Really, its just how expensive it is here. We don’t really, even though we are very, very well paid here. I’m pinching myself everyday with my Science background about this but its still not enough to buy a house, to have the kind of life we want. We’re not Australian, we don’t have family here. Its not like were gionna move to another city in Australia. That’s not meaningful to us. We could move to Adelaide but why move to Adelaide. That’s one extra flight to go home. Why would I do that? NZ, Wellington specifically is the right size of town for us. It’s the perfect compromise because I grew up in the country side so I would live in the woods if I could. Mili grew up in New York so it’s a litte different but shes getting tired of big cities too. So, small cities is kind of a perfect compromise. Its culture – one of the things that really – uhh – I cant – I, how, I mean we go to the Art Gallery in NSW every time we have a visitor and – this has happened like 2 or 3 times – I walk into the Art Gallery of NSW and I say to my visitor, I need to run to the bathroom but what you need to do is go down the stairs and to the right and at the far end of the gallery take another right, that’s the gallery you wanna go see coz theres one gallery basically, in Sydney and I know it like the back of my hand. I don’t like it. I wanna go to a gallery and see different things. That’s a very old world sort of view of the world should be about. It is not Australia’s view and I don’t begrudge it. Australia has many other things that are amazing but not for me. Theyre not amazing to me. They still don’t make up for the shortfall of traditional culture, the things I want. It’s a much friendlier place as well. Our decision was reinforced by a million times after the horrible thing that happened in Christchurch and the response that they had there. Ive never seen a people, a society react so well to something so bad. I mean, the US went on a wold wide killing spree after 9-11. These guys have the worst crime that’s ever been committed there and somehow everyones wants to move there after the response. We were actually there at the time after that happened, and we get there, and it’s a really grave atmosphere. But, people are going about their business. We were in Wellington, not in Christchurch. We were talking to everybody and everybody’s having conversations about it and saying you know, how oh you know, im gonna send a little book to the mosque tomorrow. We were in tears the whole time we were there because it was the most beautiful human reaction to something bad that had happened. It was extraordinary. That really reinforced this desire to move that. And it’s a place we can afford a house.  People in politics get in the way of things here all the time. Its not a progressive country which is fine. I don’t have to live in the most progressive place. That’s ok. But when it becomes, like, refugees are in concentration camps, and we refuse to put solar panels in our eternally sunny country because our friends in coal won’t make enough money – that’s pretty much the 2 most significant things in my world right now. You know, basically destroying the, like, it’s like a proper existential threat to humanity and this country is doing the exactly the opposite of what it should be doing, and I just dont wanna be here because of that. I know that leaving is not the answer. Staying here and having the opportunity to vote – in however many years they let me do that – would be a way to combat that. The climate change stuff, Im not gonna be waiting for 4 years to become a citizen to combat that. Im gonna go to a place where I can contribute to that sector, and they have a huge renewable sector in NZ. In fact, they run most of the renewables from Australia – wind farms, hydro, and solar – most of the actual commercial capacity is run by Australian companies. So, I could actually go an contribute there instead of being a drag here because every time I put the heater on, I’m screwing up the environment. Im not gonna freeze in the cold either. Yeah, its politics that is driving us away. It also, I felt this on a personal level whe I first got here – how can these people vote for One Nation?

It was exasperating and I took that on a personal level. I don’t anymore. But now I see it as a big societal issue. This really is a thing. People don’t feel so strongly about there being horrific racists in their family. They’re like, whatever, Ah, uncle Tim’s a racist, some people are racists, ah, its fine.

Maybe because in Argentina we are more welcoming with people and if Aussie…Australian people want to go, we won’t make it hard for them. So, here I need to prove that I have $30000. It was very hard to gather all this money, but I did it. I had to prove a lot of things. They wanted me to prove that I had things in Argentina just to bring me back after the visa, you know and I did it because I have a lot of things to go back to in Argentina. I have my family, my friends. Here I am alone and the only person I have is my partner. But, I bet for this. It’s a bet. And I only need one year for this. In one year we can make the decision – if we get married or if it is over. But, it’s like the government is pushing you, you lie, not lie but you look at different options. For instance, paying a course here just to get a student visa and on the other side I don’t want to get married straight away.

Of course, he needs to think about the kids, and I want to think well if I die. Maybe I am too much realistic. It’s like, there are too much things to think about.

I am a little bit like a slow to speak. So, this man, he wanted me to be like a superstar. He wanted to pay nothing because we are talking about, in black, cash, no taxes and he only gave me $15. I only did one trial and he wanted me to become like a superstar and he treat me really bad. Like I mentioned you before, like, misguiding me. He proposed me 2 things. I think he wanted to take advantage me because he proposed me after that if I wanted to go and get some experience with him and work for nothing, not being paid, I can go to his shop. So, work and not be paid. This is one option. And the second option he gave to me was well I have another… he had another company for cleaners and that’s something I don’t want to do. I don’t clean my house. I don’t want to go and clean someone else’s house. Really! I want something I appreciate, and I respect a lot people who do that. Of course, I respect them. In my case, what do I want for me… I want something a little bit more qualified. Slowly, slowly start to get something more qualified. Not like this. Maybe they have an idea that if you are South American or something like that, its like, you need to come here and go to clean. Hey! No. And at the same time he offered me to work for nothing. It is life. It is not fair. And if you get angry, you will lose. You say okay, thank you, I will think about it. Bye-bye. I finish with one list if things. I gathered all the documentation. It was like a mountain – mountain of things. And I say I can relax and I started to feel in my body that sensation of relax. Another list came to my email with new things. You know, really, I forgot about them. But for instance, let’s say, the statutory declaration from my community. That’s something new so I need to look for friends, waiting for them to be available, go to the police. It was really, really hard for me and everything then translated. Well, one moment was that. Everything translated in English. Well it is, I have to say, there is a logic. Its logical but I have no more money because I need to keep my living in my country. I save money because the government of Australia wanted me to prove that I have to support my living here and also paying all of that. I said I can’t, I can’t. My partner, he helped me.

And its 4 months I am living here, and I came here last year too. Really, I don’t find this something amazing. I like other kind of cities. For instance, Paris. Paris is like a museum on the street. You only need to walk, and you are in the middle of a museum. People have such good manners. Here? no!. People in France they have good manners when they eat. They are delicate. They are like stylish. Here it’s like, everything is like, gross. I’m being a horrible person if I say that. Sorry but well, it’s that. But, I really like very much this person that I found. I came here because of him. I’m just giving an opportunity to this country to fall in love with this country too. I want to. But, sometimes you want but you don’t decide. I’m trying to. He cant move. First thing because he can’t speak Spanish and he’s not willing to learn Spanish. I speak English. Maybe I’m not a C1, C2, but my English is perfect to help me to build our relationship – its enough. He has 2 kids. One of his kids, he’s disabled  - yes neurological, physiological, physical. It’s a boy. He’s only 7 years old and doctors say his expectation of life is not too long, you know. The other girl – the girl is good. No problem with her. They don’t live with us but every fortnight they come. Next week, for instance, it’s the girls birthday so we are going to celebrate. Well, instead of that I decided to come here. It’s a challenge. So, I would really like to understand why people are so in love with this country. I’m only in love with him. Well, something that I started to realise about Australia, and I love is for instance, so efficient, with the financial system. I went to the commonwealth bank and it was so easy to open an account. It was 10 minutes. I couldn’t believe it. In Argentina everything is a problem. That’s something that I really like. Now I manage all my money and all my payments through the application and it is amazing. It is easy. I’m so relaxed with that. I try to discover things in the landscape. For example, I went to this exhibition about the revolutionaries in the Melbourne museum. It was amazing and I pushed my partner to come with me because it’s like, maybe I’m wrong, but I think that sometimes maybe Australian people are not interested in culture or maybe, learning new things. They only want to wake up, go to work, come back, eat, go back to work. The routine is too strict. But, in the middle of all this there is culture. Culture is so important because it get people together. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tFinal thoughts?', '', '', '', 'Cr:\\tThis is very important for me. Look, I had a job. I had 2 jobs. One of them was a job for life. You know what I mean. I had that position and the only thing I could do in that position is growing. I quit it. It was very big decision and a very hard decision. I only could improve myself with that role. I kept my job at the university. I have a license there. So, it is 2 years. It is a university for Engineers. So, the subject that I am running there, it is like a cultural subject for future Engineers. So, for instance I have courses in civil Engineering, Mechanical and so on, like something general and they considered me for license. So university - I love it. But the other one, they said no, if you leave, you quit. That was something very hard I need to do. Like, I told you before, to bet for this person, really, look, it’s amazing how things work. I didn’t expect and really, I like him. Yes, I love him. But loving someone is not enough but also how you work together. You can love a charming prince but then the charming prince is like an idiot so you can’t keep that image. But here it’s a person that I love and I like. So, I did a lot of hard things just to give this relationship an opportunity. So, quit very important and stable job in Argentina related with my profession. The only perspective in this job was like, growing. And here, look, I have no problems. If I need to go to work in a coffee shop, I have no problems with that. I don’t like cleaning. I don’t like that. But making coffee, maybe working in a shop – I have no problem with that.

And then, kind of, life gets in the way. I got married, I got 3 kids, and had work and it just so happened, I had a really bad day at work and saw a job advertised here. I though oh, that’s quite exciting. Shall I apply, and my husband said, oh just apply. What have you got to lose – not thinking I would actually get the post. But, I got it and ended up coming back here. He’d also done backpacking here – he’d been over on a year visa. Not at the same time as be, but yeah. So, he knew what he was coming into as well. So, I flew into Sydney when I arrived the first time and didn’t like it. It felt like, it was a city that could’ve been anywhere in the world. It didn’t really feel like Australia to me at that time, and I had two weeks here, then before I went on travelling around in Australia. But then, when I came back home, I had another 2 weeks in Sydney, and I actually loved it. It was just that I had been around, and kind of knew what to expect.

So it was me in a new city, and.. but I think by the time I came back around, I had a better idea of Australia. I had a better idea of myself I think. I had to go back and finish my undergraduate. So, I was only here for a year. In fact, it just just short of a year and I knew I had to go back and finish my degree. So, wasn’t an option to stay, and at that time it was only a 1-year visa. They didn’t have this 2-year option that they have now, and it was that whole thing to having to have money in the bank to show that you have funds to travel – so I think, I had to have, like a 1000 pounds in the bank before I could get my visa to come back, and then I didn’t have any as a student.

And, at the back of my mind, I was like, lets have a holiday, lets just see if we could do this. Could we stay here. We had a great month, and then we came home and my father-in-law died. So, my mother-in-law was by herself, and my husband said, theres no way we can even think about going away, now that shes by herself. So, that kind of went on the backburner. I think it had always been at the back of my mind. My husband was sort of forced into it this time – coerced into it. I think there was always a plan, not sure if I’d actually realise it though. Didn’t think it would actually happen. Coz as my kids get bigger, there’s the thing about school, and so there was a kind of plan, that I didn’t know for sure was gonna happen…if that makes sense? So, my kids are 14, 12, and 9 – 2 in high school and one in primary. So, when we had come over for a holiday, my kids loved it – absolutely had a ball. So, I’d kind of been working on that – last couple of years, like, oh – how good would it be to live in Australia, and they are really outdoorsy. So they all surfed in Scotland. So, they all could imagine surfing in Australia. So, they definitely helped pave the way – I think they were definitely open to the thought of moving elsewhere. My husband was working. He’s a carpenter to trade but he was working in the offshore oil industry. So, he was working away for 3 weeks, home for 3 weeks, and he hated it – absolutely hated it. So, he was looking for an excuse to leave there. So, I think, I used that to my advantage as well. I think that timing worked really well with this post coming up. We had been feeling really unsettled, and maybe a change would be good. And, then my mother in law is now, has a new partner, and she lives half the year in Canada as well. Edmonton, no – my brothers in Edmonton. Shes in London, Ontario. So, that was kinda not an issue anymore either. So, it all kind of feel in place.

So, my undergraduate was in Design, and you cant do very much with a design degree, not at that time anyway. So, I left my undergraduate and went to work as a curator on an Island – so I moved to an Island – a tiny, remote Scottish Island, at the age when all the people, as 21 are leaving the island. So, it was really, a good experience but it was really hard t break into the community coz everybody goes, you know. They grow up on an island and cant wait to leave, and I was joining it. I was there for a couple of years. And then I moved back home and worked in the local government for about 4 or 5 years, in policy. So, I did policy development. And at that time I went back and did my Masters in Policy development and management. It was quite interesting how policy was written, and then got frustrated with local government, and also I had my kids at the same time. So, went free-lance and did some project management for Arts and Cultural projects, and I did that for about 10 years, and then saw a PhD position. It was in cultural policy, and I thought that’s really quite interesting. I’m kind of a really curious person and cant imagine not learning. So, I applied for this PhD position – never got it. So, I was gutted. Then they phoned me a couple of weeks later and said that we’ve got this other PhD, not in cultural policy, but in design innovation – you might be interested? So, I jumped on it. So, I did my PhD as part of a larger design project that involved 5 Art schools, it was a national project and my PhD – So, I was funded for 3 years, and my PhD fund had run out after the 3rd year and I wasn’t finished.

So, they had offered me the post, given me the contract. I had to accept it by, I think, the 18th of December before everybody broke off for Christmas, so that they can start the visa process. So, that was the 18th or 20th of December. I said yes, okay we’ll definitely take the post, we’ll make the move, subject to the visa of course. The visa came through, so yes – that was Christmas time, the school closed, and I was still getting emails from HR requesting all the information. They sent me a long list of everything they needed. I needed to get the police checks, I needed to have all the birth certificates, all the addresses where you’ve stayed, copies of my qualification, and all that kind of paperwork, and all the kids birth certificates and all because they were gonna sponsor us all to come over – and before Christmas.

I did 2 or 3 viewings and I almost cried. None of the houses were good – they were just awful. The problem was that we left a beautiful house in Scotland. We’d renovated it, and a huge huge house, and I know I wasn’t gonna get something like that here. It’s a city. We came from a rural, coastal village. So, I started to panic. And the university sent me, as part of my welcome pack, and it had, I got some relocation expenses for moving us over for our flights and towards our visa, and also they offered to reimburse an agent, or some kind of help with finding a house. The limit was $10,000 – 10000 or 5000 – It was $15,000 altogether and we could choose to spend that however – like using a relocation agent or a housing agent, or however we wanna use that relocation money. But actually our flights were about $12,000 alone. So, I couldn’t spend on a relocation expert. So, we just had to kind of do it ourselves online which was crazy. Because its so expensive and particularly coming from the UK, where the wages are not nearly the same as what they are here. So, having to find the money that we can put down for a month’s accommodation, and visa cost, and – coz I knew I would have to wait for 2 months to claim it back from the university. So I begged, borrowed and stole from parents and – until we had enough to pay for our first months accommodation. So we ended up booking an Airbnb for the first month in Lilyfield – its towards Rozelle. So, we got an Airbnb there for the first month and it was nice, it was a house, 3 bedrooms, so the little ones were together and my son had a room to himself, and it was close enough to university for me to commute – it was 20 minutes by bus. So, it was actually perfect. It did the job, and then in that time we had to find something permanent. It was really difficult. We – and I think more difficult for my husband coz he had done all the renovation so he didn’t want to live anywhere that wasn’t as good as what we had. So, really not a lot available. We looked eveuywhere. We looked at apartments, and we looked at houses. We looked all over Sydney. And the problem was I didn’t know what suburb we wanted to be based in. I forget what its called but theres a site online where you can check the suburbs and theyre given ratings. Its not Domain – I know that site the back of my hand, Ive been on it, you know, constant. Theres another site – I cant remember if its know your suburb or… you can type in, like you can search all the Australian suburbs and its gonn agive you ratings for family friendly, or convenience, or distance from the city. And we ended up scouting that and finding out which suburbs might fit, and in the end we – that last week of our Airbnb, we still hadn’t found anything. So everyday – and I was working at that time – so it was up to my husband and the kids to go look. So everyday, my husband was looking. Every evening, we were just going to viewing after viewing after viewing. And we wanted to be in the Northern beaches. We wanted to be next to the water, and on the last Wednesday before we were due to leave the Airbnb, we said right – we can’t find anything in the Northern beaches, where else can we go. And somebody here said, well have you looked down in Sutherland shire, coz you know the beaches down there. So, we said okay lets go down and see all the open viewings that day and so we went down to Cronulla, and Caringbah, and we saw one house that was perfect. It was a brand new built, 5 bedrooms – so enough bedrooms for everybody, had a swimming pool, and it was the same price as what we were looking for apartments in the city. So, I was just like, this is just amazing. We took it on the spot. So we took it for a 2 year lease. So, there’s another – as part of our searching, I had set a radius from the university of an hour’s public transport, just basically drew a circle. I just wanted it to be an hour maximum.

So, my mum used to come down at 5 in the morning to let me go for the 6 o’clock train, and she would leave the kids to school, then go to her work and come to mine after work, and give them their tea, and put them to bed, and get home at like 10 o’clock at night. So, she had a lot to do with my kids. They find it really difficult. But, they’re also supportive. They’re happy to – and I had told them that I had applied this job in Australia. They were just like – oh what has she got on her head this time. And then when I got it, my mum was excited, but my dad was very quiet. My dad is never quiet. But it’s been fine.

So everybody knows everybody, and I have a really close group of about 10 girlfriends, and all the kids are the same age, and it was hard telling them coz all the kids have grown up together, we’ve grown up together in a way I guess.

But, actually, we visited a couple of schools in the area – around the house, and we basically just ended up picking one. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSkilled visa', '', '', '', 'L:\\tIt is interesting. So when we were first coming out around, 2012, my husband would be the nominated skilled person that time coz I was in the middle of my PhD, and hes a carpenter. So, he would’ve had to do a skills test, and he refused to do a skills test. He said, I’ve been a carpenter for 20 odd years. Why would I need to go and show someone I can hammer a nail to prove myself – and he had to pay for that test as well. He was like, Im not gonna do that. So, that was a little block for us then. This time around, it was interesting because it isn’t called a skilled visa but they didn’t – apart from my qualifications, and a letter from my employer to say that I’ve been working in this capacity – that was the measure of the skill. It was interesting coz I, you know, my former employer, I got on really really well with him. So, they did really give me a good letter of reference. But I didn’t demonstrate my skills. You know, I just provided someone’s opinion of my skills. So, it was interesting for me to see how they imagine what skills are. How they articulate skills, particularly, in this context – you know in teaching, or design. They didn’t talk to any of my former students to find out if I was as skilled as I had mentioned. So, it was interested. I had to provide that letter from, as well as my reference, a letter from my employer to say that yes – I’d been working in the capacity of a senior lecturer position. I had over an x amount of time and had managed to demonstrate the skills required to perform that role. But they gave me a template for that letter for my employer to fill in. I think that was the university. So, it wasn’t even something that I had to write from scratch. Just had to fill in my name, job title, and the length of time. I guess the university knows what they’re looking for. They do this stuff all the time. But in terms of permanence, yeah I do really want to be here. We don’t want to go home. My daughter, the middle daughter – she’s 12, she’s been hearing that we’ve got a 4-year visa. She says, you know in 4 years I’m gonna be 16, im gonna be an adult, I can stay back by myself. So, if you go home to Scotland, you’ll be leaving me behind. Laughs. But yeah, I would like to see us translate that into a permanent visa. We think after the 3rd year, the university can sponsor me for PR. I did ask that in my interview, if I could go straight on to PR as opposed to TSS, and they said no. That would’ve been easier for me. I guess the added incentive was that the university was gonna pay for the relocation. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tMapping', '', '', '', 'L:\\tSo, I think. So, the visa category was a working holiday visa, It was 2001. I don’t remember what the number was and I think that I. I came out in September, no I came out in May. So, I definitely know that I flew home on the day of the Sept 11th. So, I woke up and saw the twin towers fall, and thought to myself that I had to fly on a plane all the way to Scotland. I had 3 flights to get that day, and I remember, I woke up – and I was at my aunties in Brisbane coz she was gonna drive me to the airport to get my flight to Sydney. And I remember, just waking up, having breakfast and we’d put on the news, and just watching it happen, thinking, oh my goodness. I was phoning my mum and saying I can’t possibly be flying today, what am I gonna do. But actually, it was fine. It was a really interesting flight. Everybody was kinda shell shocked and there was no luggage, like, some planes were not running. I remember I had to wait for hours in London for a final connection. So, yeah it must’ve been 2000, and 2001 when I came home. Yeah, crazy. You just never forget.  So I didn’t plan to come to Australia on that working holiday visa actually. It was between my 2nd and 3rd year at college. I wanted to go to Japan. My cousin was working in Japan at the time, and I was studying textile design, and I remember saying to one of my teachers oh my cousin’s in japan. I’d really like to go and get some textile-based experience in Japan, take the summer break. We have an extended summer break in Scotland – so it’s like May to September. She said to me I think you don’t have enough knowledge or expertise yet to do any kind of work in that field, and I was gutted. So, I never went to Japan and that’s when I thought I’m gonna actually take some time off and go to Australia. So, WHV – I don’t remember how long it took but I don’t think it took long. I just remember you had to have a 1000 pounds in your bank on a statement to show for the. So that was 2001. Okay, so then we came back in Christmas 2011-2012. We came out for 4 weeks, just a tourist visa. We went to WA. So, we went up and down the coast of Western Australia. So yeah, and then I saw the job advert, and then I was invited out. So, when I came out, when I was invited out, they said, it was in the end of November, they said, well can you come out in the next 2 weeks, which was great – it fit in my schedule but I had applied online for a visa to come out, and it hadn’t come through. They booked my flights, they paid for all my flights to come out and had applied online – it was just a tourist visa, online on the government website, and it wasn’t coming, and it wasn’t coming, and it said it will just take 40 hours to 5 days, and the clock was ticking, the clock was ticking. The day before I flew, I phoned Australia to the government thing to say, I got up in the middle of the night to phone them and say, Im meant to be coming out, I’ve paid for my flights, I don’t have the visa yet, and he said yeah theres a backlog, theres nothing we can do, you shouldn’t have booked your flights until you had your visa, and I was like Oh God, whats happening, and I happened to have mentioned it to someone else. So, nobody knew I was coming out this week. I hadn’t told any of my friends or family because I wasn’t gonna say that Im going for a job interview in case I never got it. But I had told my mum and she had spoken to somebody at work who said she can get a tourist visa from the estate agent, no travel agent. So, you can get a tourist visa, you can pay 20 pounds at the travel agent in the UK anyway. Not sure about anywhere else and I’m not sure about what it’s called. So, the morning of the day that I flew, I went to the travel agent at 9 o clock, asked them to open the door and they gave me a visa for 20 pounds in about 20 minutes. And that overrides the visa. So about 3 days into my stay here, I got an email from the government site here to say that your visa application has been cancelled. I’m thinking, what’s wrong and then I realised that it was the one that I had done online. So, you can’t get visa on arrival for Australia for me, on a UK passport. They wouldn’t let me on a flight if I didn’t have a visa. So, that was my problem. My flight was gonna take 36 hours. So, I had asked what if my government one comes through by the time I arrive? Would that be okay? And he said, well you’re not allowed to leave Scotland unless you’ve got a visa in place. And it is exactly the same visa that the government would give you but it is a different name. Its just a tourist visa. They just click a few buttons and they give you this and it lasts for 3 months, which I think is the same as the government one. But its not in the government system. Although, it must actually go through the govt system because the govt system emailed me to say we realise you’re already in Australia so we’re gonna cancel this application. So, that was a bit of stress because the morning I was flying, I was like I don’t have a visa to get in. So, I arrived, then went home again, took the job, and then the visa’s came in 6th of January 19, and we booked our flights for 25th of Feb. I was scared to book the flights until the visas weren’t there. So it wasn’t the job I applied for but I knew as soon as I came for the visit that I was gonna do the job. Absolutely. And I said that to them. Although afterwards, the dean of the school, the boss, said I didn’t think youd actually were gonna do the job. I was like really! Why!. She was like, I knew you were adventurous, but I just thought it would be too big a move for the entire family. I said well.. I always found it interesting that people interview for jobs and have no intention of taking the job. I was always gonna take the job if I was interviewing for the job, if I got offered it. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tCommercial services', '', '', '', 'L:\\tOkay so for visa prep, we had to have. So, that was a bit of a pest because they asked for all of this information over the Christmas break where everybody is shut, and everything’s closed. But we had to get two police checks. So my husband had to go get that. We had to pay for that. It was like $160 each. We had to have pay slips – 3 X payslips from both of us plus the annual tax review. We had to have the whole family’s birth certificates. I couldn’t find mine either. I found the abbreviated version but not my full one, and our marriage certificate. It was quite confusing because the university have an HR relocations person and I was issued with a contact person, and she was like my constant throughout. So, she provided me with all the information, kind of step-by-step, screen-shots of what you need to do, and usually its quite straight forward but some of the questions were, So she said – they recommended use a visa agent to do your visa application. I didn’t. They gave me list. So, they provided a list of people and companies who could do it for your visa, for schools, for accommodation. So, they provided that. I decided not to use an agent for the visa because I thought it was gonna be easy, and it was generally easy. The question that tricked me was the IELTS because I’m a national English speaker. Do I have to do IELTS? And I had to come back and ask that and she said no no, the university ticks that all for you. So, everything else was pretty straight forward. So, it’s a 2-part visa because its sponsored. So, the university had to submit all their paperwork to say that this this the post, and this is a post we can’t fill with anyone locally, the labour market testing, and then once they had their approved, they send it on to me to submit all my paperwork and the fee, and I think the fees, altogether was like $7000 for the family. The kids were quite cheap. That’s when you think we really should’ve used an agent because if that’s wrong then they can say were gonna keep that money. But luckily, it was all right. We didn’t need any medical checks. So, that surprised me because I had to have a medical check for my temporary working holiday visa. I was very surprised. What my visa does require is that I have private health insurance and I don’t know whether they think that if you have private medical insurance then you’re not gonna be a burden because you’re gonna pay for yourself but I had to tick … there were a few checkboxes that I had to tick to say that I was in good health. I’m not a bad person. But it was all self-check. I had to have... I had to supply 2 names and addresses for character witnesses to provide a character statement. I don’t know whether they were requested though. So, it was contact details for somebody to provide a character reference and I provided – one of my really good friends for the village is also a policeman. So, he certified all of my documents and he also provided a character reference – his email address and his address. I don’t think he had to sign anything to say it, but he had to agree in person. I don’t know whether they actually did that. I had to provide the letter of skills from my employer based on a template. Yea so, when the visas came back in January, they said well this is your visa paperwork and of course, it’s all just digital. So, it was just like a think you print out. But as a condition of your visa, you must have your health insurance. I’m like, yeah, that’s fine, I’ll do it. But, by the time I got around to doing it, it was like 3 days before we were leaving and I was like.. what if they ask me at the airport, have you got your health insurance and if I say ‘Not yet’, then they might not let me in through the border. Okay – so try to do it online. And there are a number of – the university game me a list of insurance people who would do the health insurance for me so I went through them – basically just trying to find the cheapest one coz UK health have a reciprocal agreement with Medicare so that still covers you for the basics and… like I finished work on the Friday, flew in the Saturday – this is the Wednesday, I thought I’d get this organised. Just between selling everything and saying goodbye to people, it just slipped my mind. So, it wasn’t through. I had submitted all the applications and done all the paperwork but didn’t receive a confirmation yet. So, I had visions of us being stopped at the airport. But actually, nobody said anything. In about a week that I was here, I actually phoned up the company that I had submitted my applications to to see – am I insured, whats happened and he said oh yeah we just need a bit more information and then we’ll back date it to the date you arrived. So, that was quite straight forward. I actually don’t know, I think I’m with NIB, but I don’t know what I’m insured for. Never used it. We’ve had three visits to the doctors for my kids since we’ve been here but just used Medicare. Nobody even asked for this. But it’s a condition of our visa. The condition of our visa is always have health insurance and I don’t take any work apart from this job but Alans open to work wherever he wants to work. My husband was worried about his police checks because he was arrested as a teenager for being drunk and disorderly. But, he’s like, he’s 46. So that’s a really long time ago but he was really anxious about it. But that was all fine. I don’t think there was anything that took long to come through or that was difficult to get. I guess in this whole process, we were realising how much money it was gonna cost and thinking is it worth it? Coz we had to pay the visa fees and we also – we have to education fees here. So, each of the kids, we have to pay the government fee of $5200 per child per year to go to school. So, that was gonna be extra. Its meant to be lump sum but we argued that I’ve got 3 kids. I cant afford that and all this. So, we’re paying in 2 blocks. It is still a lot of money. It wasn’t until a couple of weeks ago.. somebody said that, that’s actually a lot similar to some of the private school fees for primary, and you could’ve thought to put your younger one in private school. But actually, they’re settled in this school. Its interested because the schools don’t get that money. The schools get about, I think they said, about a hundred dollars extra but the government get that money. So, what am I paying that money for? Do you know what I mean – like if its not going to schools for providing education for my child. That was another reason I wanted PR at the start because then I don’t have to pay the school fees. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tTechnology', '', '', '', 'L:\\tAll the visa prep was all online. All submission of documents, even the police check, everything – it was all online which was simple, easy. I guess from, probably when I was invited out was when I started doing some actual online research thinking hmm this might actually happen. So, I… it was really difficult finding information about family migration and stories of family migration. I found one blog and I kept coming back to her information (I cant remember the name) – and it was things like thinking about schools, thinking about suburbs to live in, and she was just one person who actually migrated herself I think and its quite out of date. But everything I searched for, I just came back to her. So, it was this one woman blog. It was quite outdated but she had guest submissions to her blog. I guess she had guest submissions about visas and stuff. Why it was so difficult – there was lots of information about 457 but because 482 was so new, it was difficult. There was very little in terms of peoples experiences around it. That was difficult. I don’t Facebook, I don’t use FB. I have FB to have access to my kids dancing classes because that’s where they post that information, but I don’t use it as a networking thing. So, there was nothing on there that I looked at. But this suburb site – its like a suburb rating site – I used that a lot. And the problem with these kind of sites is that they’re like review sites but people only post negative reviews generally because there’s no incentive for you to post something positive. But, they were a good indicator of what a suburb was like I felt and so we did use that a lot for reviews and Domain and Real estate. I was really just wanting to find a resource that was about family migration but its fluid. There’s not such a thing as a resource. Who’s gonna keep it up to date? I’m sure there were those things where I clicked at something and there was a response in a forum but I never engaged in a forum. There are – although now – our house that we rented for a year, the owner, the house owner, out it up for sale about a month ago. I was like oh no were gonna have to move again, what are we gonna do. There were a couple of open houses and then it got sold. It got sold in the 2nd viewing, and the people who bought it are gonna continue having it as a rental so we can continue to stay there. So, we were like phew. But I did join the Sutherland shire community facebook page because I was looking for other houses in that area. There’s a buy and sell and swap page, but for me, I was hoping to find other accommodation on that site. Although I didn’t need to use it but that’s what I imagined I would use it for. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tSocial Connections', '', '', '', 'L:\\tSo def my cousin Stuart who was based here for most of the time. He was quite important. I guess he was important for providing that safe post box but also to know there was somebody here if something was to go crazy and also when I knew, so it wasn’t gonna be the job I applied for but there was gonna be a job, I needed to know that the money they were offering me was money that I could live on coz I actually had no idea. In the greater scheme of things – how much does it cost to live in Sydney, was I gonna be able to live on that wage. So, this is someone I could ask those questions to.. this is what theyre offering me. Is it worth it? Would I manage to live on that? And of course he said yes. So, he was like a sounding board. Martin here, who is my line manager. He is from Austria originally. So he’s a migrant too and he shared about his experience, and hes been here a long time now. It was helpful coz hes got kids too and he talked about what that was like. His kids are kinda similar ages as well. Lots of people at home in Scotland were really nice. So, when the community, they heard that we were moving they were like ‘Oh we’ve got family here, or we know this person’. So we got lots of addresses and phone numbers. We never followed up on any of them. But, I guess they’re all kinda there. We just haven’t had time. It was so fast. So, people were always happy to provide, you know like somebody, in this context that could help if you needed them. And, Amika, whos the HR relocation person – she was great because I sent her lots of emails to say…what about this, what about this, how long till I get my money back. I don’t know if there was anybody else. I did it all. Alan just got on the plane with the kids. He didn’t really do any of this. And then I guess we had the people at the stage that we sold our house. Actually, we put it up for sale when we were still there, but it sold after we left. So, my mum and dad were power of attorney to sign off on that.', '', '', '', 'M:\\tHusband?', '', '', '', 'L:\\tSo, when we arrived the kids… So in Scotland, the schools run from August to July. That’s the school year. But here the School year runs January to December. So, we moved in Feb.. they had already done 6 months of school – in the school here. So, when we got here, they had to go back 6 months which meant that they didn’t have to go to school straight away. They had about 6 weeks to get settled in before they went to school. So, Alan didn’t work that time, and it was good for me because it meant I could focus on getting to work, finding my feet, not having to worry about childcare and that kind of this. So, that was the first 6 weeks. Then we moved into our house in Sutherland shire so that was a couple of weeks before school and then there was Easter holidays. So, he said he’d probably go to work after Easter holidays. They went back to school after Easter holidays and he started looking for things, for jobs, but there was nothing really. I don’t that he was actively looking, and then there was summer holidays. My daughter got sick in between so she missed about 2 weeks of school in that term so he was off for that, which was okay. And then there was the summer holidays. So, it was like, okay, after the summer holidays, and after the summer holidays I had to go to Malaysia. So it was like, okay after I come back from Malaysia. So now the kids are back into school and hes gonna have to start looking for something. But hes gonna look for something part-time so he can work around the kids. He fancies a career change but he doesn’t know what and he isn’t the kinda, you know, hes in a new place, perfect place to have a career change. But the longer hes gonna think about it, the harder it is going to be for him to get a job. You know, the confidence, and so on. But he needs to build a network, so I feel he needs to get a job, and I’ve been trying to do that in a diplomatic way. Laughs. But, it’s just not happening. So, he is, he doesn’t really do online coz internet was after he left school and all that. But he does do Gumtree coz that’s where he was looking at cars, on Gumtree, coz we don’t have a car yet. So, that’s what hes focusing on at the moment. But, he does the school run in the morning. So, he sees all the parents and stuff but the area that we live in, its more of a – its not really a city – its more of a suburb. So a lot of the mums don’t work.. theres a lot of stay at home mums.. so its mostkly mums at school who actually don’t really speak to him. But he has made… so we have 2 sets to neighbours that we have become good friends with and he has 2 other neighbours – one is 70 and one is 80 – and they keep knocking on our door to ask him to come and do little jobs, like lift things, or fix this, or fix that. Every time he does that, they try to pay him and hes like no I’m not taking money for this. So he comes home with these things.. he came home with a golf set.. he came home with a mixer… theyre just giving him stuff. So, hes been meeting people but he doesn’t have a network of people who are the same age, and I think that’s what he would need for him to get into work. And I think, its difficult coz our roles have completely been reversed as well. So, he was the main breadwinner and now hes not working at all, and I’ve got a network here and he doesn’t have that. So, its difficult for him. I don’t doubt that its difficult for him, and that makes him homesick. And because he was away working offshore a lot of the time, so he didn’t have the time with the kids. So, its nice for him to have that. But he has to adjust to what that feels like because it isn’t all roses like he imagines it. The kids are grumpy in the morning and he gets annoyed about making lunches, and da da da.. so I think, its just gonna take some time.

But this time, it was almost like it happened. I didn’t expect it to be so easy and I did not expect the visa to come through so quickly and I think its because of the university in part because it’s a huge institution and they do this regularly. One of the big concerns I had coming was disrupting the kids, you know they had friends, and their lifestyle. So, I was really wanted to make sure that.. So, my daughter dances and my son does jujitsu. So, I wanted to find somewhere that they could get back into this stuff straight away. So that had a lot to do choosing the location as well. And I did use that Sutherland shire FB page to see what dances available, what jujitsu places. So, I guess that helped get recommendations because theres 100’s of dance schools. Whats a good dance school. So I did use that. There was, one of the first weeks, in our house. There was a local newspaper that came through, and it was volunteer week, and there was a call out for volunteers to go visit older people, elderly people. So we had a chat at home and we thought well lets sign up for that because the kids don’t have their grannies anymore… just that intergenerational connection. But we never got around to that.

And even, the information from the immigration adviser was framed around, okay what does it mean for me to come as a single person, but I was like, I’m also coming with 3 kids.

Definitely be open to looking at, although I love it here, but potentially somewhere norther, where its cheaper for houses.

We’re actually looking for a van so we can go away and things, you know, we can put bikes at the back or the surfboards at the back. One thing I do love about Sydney is the public transport. It’s just so easy and so cheap. It’s just so so cheap compared to Scotland. So cheap. Im in the highlands of Scotland where the infrastructure is really poor, the buses run, like, every hour and the train network doesn’t reach anywhere you need to go.

So, I guess we are.. actually, we’re on one wage but probably living the same quality of life that we were in Scotland which is good. Just 70% of my wages in going on accommodation which is crazy. Super crazy. Everything else is alright. That’s another reason why Alan needs to start working. Im really conscious... I don’t want to start chipping away our house money coz oce we start, its gonna be gone. You know what – you’ve just left me with a question of whether my friend was asked for a character reference or not. ', '', '', '', 'M:\\tMapping?', '', '', '', 'L:\\tYes. So, I love it. This is exactly what I did in my PhD interviews as well. I did mapping. For me, selfishly what attracted me to do this research is that everything’s been so much of a blur, its just been so quick. I haven’t had time to sit back and think what did it mean, what did I have to do. So, this has given me the space to do that. Actually, its quite amazing I managed to do all of that in that length of time.']\n"
