      "I am from Sweden and my de facto partner is from Australia. We lodge an offshore visa on the 29th of November. Eight days after the lodgment I received an correspondence letter from our CO to my email to ask for a my medical. I booked one asap and I am glad I got in for an appointment as they only had limited appointments available. Only certain panel doctors who are approved in Sweden. Only two and the closest one I had to go to was 2 hours away, Stockholm. I also saw my partner was approved as a sponsor which was a positive sign. \n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyone knows how come they do it so fast? is it because its an offshore 309/100 ? me and my partner have been a couple for 2,5 years. Believe me we are super happy about this so I am not questioning their decision but just VERY surprised. Best Xmas present ever!!!\n",

Could it happen they would want to have a look at my case earlier than 2 years? since it was very quick granting my 309 visa. How do I know? and do I just enter my immi account and clique on the second stage visa and start uploading it all there? \n",
