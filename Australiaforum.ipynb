For example - the wait for a 309 from Kenya or Pakistan or Bosnia-Herzegovina can be 18 months or longer, but the wait for a 309 from, say, Berlin is more like 6-8 months.

When a CO gets assigned varies, whether you get notified of this varies, how long your acknowledgment takes varies, how long processing takes varies, if they tell you how long processing will take varies, IF they stick to their quoted processing times varies, whether processing times are getting slower or looking like they might be getting better varies, which forms you need to provide varies, whether or not a tourist visa during processing could potentially affect your application processing time varies, what requirements they have for proving genuine relationships (to some extent) varies, what sort of marriage ceremony needs to have been had for them to view it as legit can vary, etc. etc. etc. It's insane how different requirements can be from embassy to embassy!

That is, circumstances beyond the applicant’s control had led them to become unlawful and/or prevented them from regularising their status through means other than the Partner visa application for which they seek the waiver.\\n\\nFor example, in the scenario given earlier, it is reasonable to accept that compelling circumstances exist to waive the Schedule 3 criteria if, for reasons beyond the applicant’s control - such as severe illness or incapacity - the applicant was prevented from regularising their status in the years they had been unlawful.\\nAs a general rule, the existence of a genuine spouse or de facto relationship between the applicant and sponsoring partner, and/or the hardship suffered from the separation if the applicant were to leave, and apply for the visa, outside Australia are not, in themselves, compelling reasons not to apply the Schedule 3 criteria. This is because a genuine relationship forms the basis of all Partner visa applications, and hardship caused by separation, whilst it differs in degree from one case to another, is common in the Partner visa caseload, particularly in the offshore context where partners may be separated for extended periods during visa processing.\\n\\nPolicy intends that the waiver provision should not be applied where it is reasonable to expect the applicant to leave Australia and apply outside Australia for a Partner visa. This not only ensures fairness and equity to other applicants and discourages deliberate non-compliance, but also preserves the integrity of the Partner visa program in general and the waiver provisions in specific.\\n\\nMatters that officers should take into consideration when assessing whether the applicant’s circumstances may be considered compelling include but are not limited to:\\n\\n\\uf0a7\\tany history of non-compliance by the applicant\\n\\uf0a7\\tthe length of time the applicant has been unlawful\\n\\uf0a7\\tthe reasons why the applicant became unlawful\\n\\uf0a7\\tthe reasons why the applicant did not seek to regularise their status sooner\\n\\uf0a7\\twhat steps, if any, the applicant has taken to regularise their status (other than applying for a Partner visa).\\n\\nMy bold, as many never get an 820 onshore option.\\n\\nYour Migration Lawyer should have access to the exact current policy wording.', \"Quote:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by kthomp13\\n\\n\\nOur story is a little different as my husband is a US citizen, i was living over there on a tourist visa.

      "[\"Hi everyone!\\n\\r\\nMy partner and I are coming up to the 2nd Stage of our 820/801 Partner Visa application. We are currently in the process of gathering up all of our evidence so we are prepared when the 2 year mark rolls around in the next 2 months. I have a potentially stupid question regarding Stat Decs.\\n\\r\\nI believe we both have to fill out Statutory Declarations about our relationship, however the Department of Home Affairs website isn't really clear on this since they updated the department and the website. I was only able to find this on the website (immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/form-listing/forms/stat_dec_sponsor.pdf)\\n\\r\\nDoes anyone know if this is just for the sponsor to fill out, or if it can be used for both the sponsor and the applicant ? From memory, I think there used to be a different PDF available for the applicant, but I can't find it anywhere on their official website which is what is confusing me. We applied in 2017 and it looks like this may have changed a bit since we last had to deal with what is now the Department of Home Affairs, the website is not as informative as it used to be that is for sure! \\n\\r\\nAlso out of curiosity, does the department still accept 'Relationship Statements' in lieu of Statutory Declarations like they used to, or do they require them to all be official Statutory Declarations now ? \\n\\r\\nDo they require the Statutory Declarations to be the form they supply from their website ?\\n\\n\\r\\nGoing through this all again is already starting to stress me right out!\\r\\nThanks in advance for any help or insight!\", \"Hi Cloneclub -\\n\\nNo such thing as a stupid question! For second stage partner visa applications, the only stat dec required (other than 2 Form 888s which are stat decs) is a stat dec from the sponsor - that's the template you noted you found on their website and it's generally good form to use that template - you can make the responses to each question as long as you like however. There is no requirement that the applicant provide a stat dec, however in many cases it's helpful if the applicant puts in an updated relationship statement that tells the story of the relationship continuing after the grant date of the first stage partner visa - and tells the story from the applicant's point of view to add to the sponsor's point of view as expressed on the required sponsor stat dec. \\n\\nWhile paper partner visa applications are rare these days (and only allowed by permission of DHA), if the second stage partner visa WAS a paper application, then both sponsor and applicant would need to put in a stat dec about the relationship since the grant of the first stage partner visa.\\n\\nHope this helps -\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nMark Northam\"]\n",

Soon after my BVA kicked in, I applied for a Tax File Number, and enrolled into Medicare. Currently I'm looking for a job. In terms of visa, there is nothing I can do now except waiting patiently for my 820 because you really don't know how long it will take.

I\\'m originally from Michigan, USA, and we didn\\'t do a 300 first--I was in Australia on a work and holiday visa for a few months before we decided to get married. My husband and I have been in a relationship for eight years, so we knew we were going to get married eventually. A work and holiday visa made the most sense when I applied, but a variety of factors ended up changing \"the plan\" to get married later, so we ended up eloping and applying for this visa.\\n\\nI applied back in March, but without the police checks or medical completed. I\\'ve been having horrible difficulties getting an FBI police check done. Money just left my account for what I hope to be my last application. Hopefully it turns up soon so I can get it in!

However, months down the track, my only real concern has been about getting this police check in and doing the medical (there\\'s nothing wrong with me that I know about, but I really don\\'t like going to the doctor! Completely irrational, I know). Another worry was about my husband, who is my sponsor, not making enough money as he was in a part-time position when we applied, but he\\'s working full-time now and in a higher wage bracket as well, so no more worries there.
