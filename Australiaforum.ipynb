      "[\"Hi,\\n\\r\\nSo a bit of a background. I'm currently awaiting a decision for a 461 Temporary NZ Family Visa with my partner. Originally I came to Australia on a WHV and within that year we applied for the 461 visa. I was granted a BVA with the same work limitations as my WHV which is the 8547 limitation of 6 months per employer. When my WHV expired I went on my BVA which resets my working rights. I'm currently working at company doing marketing work which took me many months and interviews to land and it's the first full-time position I was able to get since coming here back in September of 2017..so its been a long and difficult journey. \\n\\r\\nIt's coming towards the end of my work duration and I know I can apply for a change of status with the form 1005 to have that limitations possibly removed. However, my partner and I are currently planning a trip overseas, so I applied for a BVB and was granted one. Well recently I also filed the 1005 and they called me stating that if they were to file this, it'll override my BVB. It will also have the same 8547 restriction on it. So I told them to hold off.\\n\\r\\nSo my question is, does the BVB have its own 6 months limitation separate from the BVA? Meaning I can work an additional 6 months starting when the BVB was granted? \\n\\r\\nOr if after I finish my trip and reapply for the 1005 and they grant me another BVA with the same restriction to override my BVB, will I then be able to work for another 6 months as it would be a new BVA visa?\\n\\r\\nMy 461 application is about 14 months old now, I think another 6 months will possibly get it approved and let me stay at my current position.\\n\\r\\nThanks,\\n\\r\\nLuckyAU7\", \"Hi @LuckyAU7, \\n\\r\\nJust wondering if you could give a quick update on what happened?\\n\\r\\nI'm in a similar situation, so very interested to hear back from you!\\n\\r\\nGood luck with your application, \\n\\r\\nBest regards, \\r\\nT\", 'Quote:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by tomar1\\n\\n\\nHi @LuckyAU7, \\n\\r\\nJust wondering if you could give a quick update on what happened?\\n\\r\\nI\\'m in a similar situation, so very interested to hear back from you!\\n\\r\\nGood luck with your application, \\n\\r\\nBest regards, \\r\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\nHey @tomar1, \\n\\r\\nEvery visa has it\\'s own work rights. As stated, when you go from a WHV to a BVA, your 6 months are reset.

This was confirmed by the immigration lawyers at a recruitment agency and by the lawyers at the company I worked at. I also called the immigration office and they also confirmed it, however they weren\\'t aware this could be done and had to refer back to that link above. \\n\\r\\nSo for $150, you can reset your work rights, however I recommend your company\\'s lawyers confirm this on their end. It\\'s not 100% certainty here. \\n\\r\\nThis worked for me and I was able to extend my work rights for 4 more months before I applied using the 1005 form, which removes the work limitations completely. I recommend trying your luck with this as its much more long term than trying to extend every 6 months if you can prove financial hardship.\\n\\r\\nHope this helps.', 'Quote:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by LuckyAU7\\n\\n\\nHey @tomar1, \\n\\r\\nEvery visa has it\\'s own work rights.

You\\'re not in financial hardship now, but you will be if you don\\'t keep your current job.\\n\\r\\nJust print and send with no certification but if it makes you feel better why not get it certified.']\n"
