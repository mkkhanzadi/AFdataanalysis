So there are threads for specific embassies so you get information (and can commiserate with) people who are going through the same process as you are.  For example - the wait for a 309 from Kenya or Pakistan or Bosnia-Herzegovina can be 18 months or longer, but the wait for a 309 from, say, Berlin is more like 6-8 months. And the embassies handle the process very differently. That's why general 309 threads don't tend to last long - people seek out other people going through the same thing as them.\\n\\nAs an example, if you talked to someone applying from the US they'd tell you it was just fine to apply for a visitor visa while you're waiting out the 309, and that your CO will let you know when to get offshore to get your visa granted, and it won't delay it (it's true in almost every embassy). But if that information was given to someone applying through India, they'd risk delaying their application by several months if they didn't time their visitor visa correctly.\\n\\nJust my two cents!\", \"Quote:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by CollegeGirl\\n\\n\\nJmac, the reason is that the process and the experiences vary widely from embassy to embassy.

I knew there were embassy-specific forums but nobody seems to apply from New Zealand! So it's kind of sad to be all alone! I was hoping there might be some moral support since we're all offshore, some of the experience may be universal. \\n\\r\\nJust a question you might be able to help with - now that most applications are online, do the applications still get assigned to an embassy?\", \"Yes, they do still get assigned to an embassy - whichever one is closest to you in most cases. \\n\\nThere really won't be too many universal experiences embassy to embassy, unfortunately, except for the waiting (and even that will be different since some people have two years of waiting while others have six months, and some people can visit their partners while waiting and others can't). When a CO gets assigned varies, whether you get notified of this varies, how long your acknowledgment takes varies, how long processing takes varies, if they tell you how long processing will take varies, IF they stick to their quoted processing times varies, whether processing times are getting slower or looking like they might be getting better varies, which forms you need to provide varies, whether or not a tourist visa during processing could potentially affect your application processing time varies, what requirements they have for proving genuine relationships (to some extent) varies, what sort of marriage ceremony needs to have been had for them to view it as legit can vary, etc. etc. etc. It's insane how different requirements can be from embassy to embassy!

The statistics suggest a much different reality.\\n\\r\\nA Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the Department of Home Affairs earlier this year exposed a startling picture on the visa refusal rates of the offshore Subclass 309/100 \\x96 Partner and onshore Subclass 820/801 \\x96 Partner visa when a migration agent is not appointed (and therefore assumed to have not assisted with the application).\\n\\r\\nThe statistics for the 2015/16 financial year revealed that 63.4% of partner visas lodged did not appoint a migration agent, while in the 2016/17 financial year it was 59.6%. This is not surprising.\\n\\r\\nWhat is surprising is the visa refusal rates for unrepresented applicants. In the 2015/16 financial year it was an incredible 53.8%. In 2016/17, it was not much better at 47%. Average both years and it comes to just above half of all do-it-yourself partner visa applications being refused.\\n\\r\\nWhat could be the cause of these visa refusals? Many factors come to mind, including:\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw those figures before, but also another FOI report (FA180700438) showed this:\\n\\r\\nA Freedom of Information report from Australian Immigration, has shown the numbers of Partner Visa Refusals, distributed between applications lodged with and without a Migration agent, and finalised in 2017/18.\\n\\r\\nThe figures below, taken from that report, show:\\n\\r\\n13.23% of offshore partner visa applications lodged WITH a Migration agent were refused.\\r\\n12.36% of onshore partner visa applications lodged WITH a Migration agent were refused.\\n\\r\\n7.39% of offshore partner visa applications lodged WITHOUT a Migration agent were refused.\\r\\n8.13% of onshore partner visa applications lodged WITHOUT a Migration agent were refused.', \"thanks for that . wow , so that agent's figures were WAY OUT  and not sure \\r\\nhow they get away with it but obviously no false advertising legislation \\r\\nin OZ . thanks again\", \"I am not sure what is actually right or wrong.  Some statistics can be read in different ways.\\n\\nBut we don't seem to hear about many refusals compared to grants, on the forum.\\n\\nAnd of course some of these migration agents might be offshore agents...\", 'true but a massive difference between the two sets of figures even though different years . Some of the reasons in that article at end made me wonder how some people  would even apply and pay the huge fee when \\r\\nobvious to anyone with a modicum of intelligence that the application was \\r\\ndoomed to  failure. When my ex wife applied in 2014 , I used this forum and \\r\\ngot useful info or a second opinion from helpful folk and also did not hear of anyone who was not successful but  maybe such aplicants would be so \\r\\ndevastated and would not post the result .', 'In 16+ years I have not had a finalised partner appilcation refused. I have represented/advised DIY applicants who were refused and have had only one such application refused.', \"I am a bit confused by your 2nd sentence as seems to be conflicting statements  but I must be misunderstanding . But what about Jand E's \\r\\npost which shows that less chance of success using an agent in one year  which is \\r\\na little surprising but might be linked to an agent  having too many cases to attend to whereas aan applicant doing it herself or himself can focus 100% on the task - human nature really .\", \"Wrussell's comment is interesting as it might explain some inconsistency with statistics.\\n\\r\\nHis later assistance with an applicants previous  refusal (either from another agent or a DIY application) might even have that refusal linked to an agent.\\n\\r\\nWho knows for sure how these statistics are created. \\n\\r\\nThere are two sets of figures from FOI's, very different and both seem puzzling.\", 'Try an FoI request to the DHA for the relative success rates of: DIY, managed by unregistered migration agents, managed by  registered migration agents and similarly to the AAT, leaving out unregistered in this case, then lodge another FoI for the reasons for refusal in registered migration agent cases. \\n\\nThe are lies, damned lies and statistics.\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_...and_statistics', \"Quote:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by wrussell\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe are lies, damned lies and statistics.\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_...and_statistics\\n\\n\\n\\nTo be fair your statistics are biased too...\\n\\r\\nYou have 100% success rate because you can tell when a potential client is not eligible so you refuse them. (I don't blame you for it). \\n\\r\\nJust because you got a visa for your client doesn't mean your client would not have succeeded in getting this visa if they had attempted to apply alone. By definition if they got the visa it means they were eligible, so just because they did not feel comfortable doing the application themselves do not mean they would not have succeeded if they had given it a try.\\n\\r\\nAnd conversely: just because an unrepresented applicant was refused a visa, it doesn't mean you would necessarily have succeeded in getting it for them. If they were not eligible you cannot perform any miracle and magically create supporting documents out of thin air. No agent can change the fact that some people are simply not eligible to get a visa.\"]\n",

That is, circumstances beyond the applicant’s control had led them to become unlawful and/or prevented them from regularising their status through means other than the Partner visa application for which they seek the waiver.\\n\\nFor example, in the scenario given earlier, it is reasonable to accept that compelling circumstances exist to waive the Schedule 3 criteria if, for reasons beyond the applicant’s control - such as severe illness or incapacity - the applicant was prevented from regularising their status in the years they had been unlawful.\\nAs a general rule, the existence of a genuine spouse or de facto relationship between the applicant and sponsoring partner, and/or the hardship suffered from the separation if the applicant were to leave, and apply for the visa, outside Australia are not, in themselves, compelling reasons not to apply the Schedule 3 criteria. This is because a genuine relationship forms the basis of all Partner visa applications, and hardship caused by separation, whilst it differs in degree from one case to another, is common in the Partner visa caseload, particularly in the offshore context where partners may be separated for extended periods during visa processing.\\n\\nPolicy intends that the waiver provision should not be applied where it is reasonable to expect the applicant to leave Australia and apply outside Australia for a Partner visa. This not only ensures fairness and equity to other applicants and discourages deliberate non-compliance, but also preserves the integrity of the Partner visa program in general and the waiver provisions in specific.\\n\\nMatters that officers should take into consideration when assessing whether the applicant’s circumstances may be considered compelling include but are not limited to:\\n\\n\\uf0a7\\tany history of non-compliance by the applicant\\n\\uf0a7\\tthe length of time the applicant has been unlawful\\n\\uf0a7\\tthe reasons why the applicant became unlawful\\n\\uf0a7\\tthe reasons why the applicant did not seek to regularise their status sooner\\n\\uf0a7\\twhat steps, if any, the applicant has taken to regularise their status (other than applying for a Partner visa).\\n\\nMy bold, as many never get an 820 onshore option.\\n\\nYour Migration Lawyer should have access to the exact current policy wording.', \"Quote:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by kthomp13\\n\\n\\nOur story is a little different as my husband is a US citizen, i was living over there on a tourist visa.

      "[\"Hi everyone!\\n\\r\\nMy partner and I are coming up to the 2nd Stage of our 820/801 Partner Visa application. We are currently in the process of gathering up all of our evidence so we are prepared when the 2 year mark rolls around in the next 2 months. I have a potentially stupid question regarding Stat Decs.\\n\\r\\nI believe we both have to fill out Statutory Declarations about our relationship, however the Department of Home Affairs website isn't really clear on this since they updated the department and the website. I was only able to find this on the website (immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/form-listing/forms/stat_dec_sponsor.pdf)\\n\\r\\nDoes anyone know if this is just for the sponsor to fill out, or if it can be used for both the sponsor and the applicant ? From memory, I think there used to be a different PDF available for the applicant, but I can't find it anywhere on their official website which is what is confusing me. We applied in 2017 and it looks like this may have changed a bit since we last had to deal with what is now the Department of Home Affairs, the website is not as informative as it used to be that is for sure! \\n\\r\\nAlso out of curiosity, does the department still accept 'Relationship Statements' in lieu of Statutory Declarations like they used to, or do they require them to all be official Statutory Declarations now ? \\n\\r\\nDo they require the Statutory Declarations to be the form they supply from their website ?\\n\\n\\r\\nGoing through this all again is already starting to stress me right out!\\r\\nThanks in advance for any help or insight!\", \"Hi Cloneclub -\\n\\nNo such thing as a stupid question! For second stage partner visa applications, the only stat dec required (other than 2 Form 888s which are stat decs) is a stat dec from the sponsor - that's the template you noted you found on their website and it's generally good form to use that template - you can make the responses to each question as long as you like however. There is no requirement that the applicant provide a stat dec, however in many cases it's helpful if the applicant puts in an updated relationship statement that tells the story of the relationship continuing after the grant date of the first stage partner visa - and tells the story from the applicant's point of view to add to the sponsor's point of view as expressed on the required sponsor stat dec. \\n\\nWhile paper partner visa applications are rare these days (and only allowed by permission of DHA), if the second stage partner visa WAS a paper application, then both sponsor and applicant would need to put in a stat dec about the relationship since the grant of the first stage partner visa.\\n\\nHope this helps -\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nMark Northam\"]\n",

I know the results are only good for a year, but as it\\'s been eight months for me now, I doubt it\\'s going to take another full year to process my application--fingers crossed, anyway.\\n\\nWhen I was filling out the application I was stressing about having enough evidence and I was really nervous about forgetting something or not including enough. However, months down the track, my only real concern has been about getting this police check in and doing the medical (there\\'s nothing wrong with me that I know about, but I really don\\'t like going to the doctor! Completely irrational, I know). Another worry was about my husband, who is my sponsor, not making enough money as he was in a part-time position when we applied, but he\\'s working full-time now and in a higher wage bracket as well, so no more worries there. As for other evidence, I\\'ve gained more confidence in what we turned in and have decided not to let it stress me out so much.\\n\\nIt\\'s so nice to hear from other people who are applying for the same visa as me! I hope everyone gets theirs granted soon.', 'SAME BOAT HERE!\\nI have applied on Dec 19th 2012 and so far the only email I received from immi is an automated one stating that my application is now being processed in WA even though I applied in Sydney....', \"Same boat here.
