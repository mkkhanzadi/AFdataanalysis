			Please note that the Department of Immigration and Border protection will no longer contact you when you are eligible for the permanent visa (2 years after applying for the temporary partner visa).  
 
It is up to the visa applicant to keep track of it and to provide the additional documentation for the permanent stage when required.  
 
 Failure to do so may result in your visa being refused.

			I didn't know so I lodged the second stage application 10 weeks later. 
Applied 820 7/08/2015 
Applied 801 25/10/2017 
 
Will this affect the time process? 
On my IMMI account is written that application will take 16 up to 22 months for application submitted by 31st of october.

 Don't quote me on this, but I'm pretty sure that 801 applications are processed in order of eligibility date not upload date. So, as long as you got your 801 application in before DIBP started processing your application (which you obviously have) you should be fine  
 
Best of luck and try not to stress during the wait!

			Hi guys!  
I am new to this forum, but have been following this forum throughout my partner visa application. 
 
I am from Sweden and my de facto partner is from Australia. We lodge an offshore visa on the 29th of November. Eight days after the lodgment I received an correspondence letter from our CO to my email to ask for a my medical. I booked one asap and I am glad I got in for an appointment as they only had limited appointments available. Only certain panel doctors who are approved in Sweden. Only two and the closest one I had to go to was 2 hours away, Stockholm. I also saw my partner was approved as a sponsor which was a positive sign.  
 
So on Monday morning on the 18th of Dec 2017 we got our visa approved. I am still in shock since it said *estimated global processing time* 11-16 months. Me and my partner probably spent a month gathering documents and putting it all together. and our response was quicker. WOW amazing.  
 
I'ts almost like I am wondering how they could grant it so quick?? we did provide a lot of information and had 6 people writing stats dec and written statements. we basically provided everything except my medical.  
 
Anyone knows how come they do it so fast? is it because its an offshore 309/100 ? me and my partner have been a couple for 2,5 years. Believe me we are super happy about this so I am not questioning their decision but just VERY surprised. Best Xmas present ever!!! 
 
When it comes to the second stage visa I have seen others mentioning I have to upload documents without having a CO letting me know they're looking at our case again.  
How do I know when to start uploading the documents?? just before the 2 year stage. Could it happen they would want to have a look at my case earlier than 2 years? since it was very quick granting my 309 visa. How do I know? and do I just enter my immi account and clique on the second stage visa and start uploading it all there?  
sorry for all my questions. Hope someone could answer me  
xx

			Wow!! Fantastic news! Congratulations! 
I am currently trying to get a visa application together for my English De-facto partner. 
Would you be able to tell me what evidence you provided to get it approved so quickly?  
Any help would be fantastic!!

 Thank you so much! Me and my partner still cannot believe it but we are so happy!! 
Are you applying for an offshore visa or onshore visa? 
 
We made sure we had all the information they needed, except for medical. We had to wait until a case officer asked me for it, as they provide us with a HAP ID number that your doctor will need.

 Me - Applicant

- Copy of Drivers License + my international license  
-80 filled out - takes ages

It seems a bit excessive I know, but trust me it is worth using it all. Proves that you are really committed to each other.  
 
This is the most important things you need to use or find out about. Some things I have not gone into details about as you'll learn as you go. But ill send you this link that is really good to read through before you start, or use whilst in the process of providing all your information.  
Be patient. it does take time. I have spent 12 hours/day some days. Onc you start its hard to put it aside as you just want it to be done with. But it is all worth it in the end to put that extra effort into what you both want. To be able to live and spend the rest of your lives together.  
 
Do not hesitate to ask more questions I you have any. More than happy to help. Hope what I have written so far does.

			Hi-  
I've just put through our 801 application. I'm unclear what documents that we should upload. Don't they have everything from the 820? Since applying, we've had a child so can upload that but not sure what else to upload that's new. Or do they not keep previous documents and I have to upload everything again?

			Thats fantastic. And very quick. We submitted same for our in october. everything is the same, we are married legally and have 7 year history. 
 
the difference is country of submission and associated risk/resourcing. 
 
the applicant in our case is thai and deemed higher risk. due to this risk (aka racism)  we have supplied all information in oct last year and must keep waiting. 
 
congratulations and good luck

			Hello everyone!! I am also new and I am somewhat scared. I uploaded my application for the 820 visa on November 27, 2017 and in two months we have already requested the police checks and the medical exams, I am a bit overwhelmed since all this is very fast and we have not had time to gather more information. My agent does not understand and there are people waiting for many months! I am in a relationship since 2015 and in a de facto for more than a year. Does anyone know why? If the waiting time is supposed to be 12 to 14 months? thanks heaps!

 When the waiting time was 12 to 14 months it meant that 75% were done within 12 months. 
Only 15% took 12-14 months. 
 
Some are done quickly,  although it is now 75% in under 20 months. 
 
The problem now, is that if an application is not complete when submitted,  it can be rejected for insufficient evidence.  
 
Worthwhile getting it all in quickly.

 Our PIDs medical an pol check requests came the same week we paid the fee. We supplied all this within the stated time frame but haven't heard squat since. That was early October. 
 
Some area seem to be testing the automation systems within the client enterprise system linked to immiaccount more than others.   
 
thing is you shouldn't really submit application if youre not ready and 2nd question i would have is why your agent has not advised on this?

			Hi guys! 
 
If anyone can clear this up for me I'd really appreciate it... 
 
My husband was granted visa 309 n the 8th of December 2015... 
 
We forgot all about stage 2 as the DIBP no longer send reminders (WHYYYY!!??) and did not lodge for subclass 100 until 17th of Jan 20 2018 - 2 years 2 months and 9 days after 309 was granted...Firstly, are we too late?!??! 
 
Secondly... home affairs website says subclass 100 processing time is 20-23 months. Does that mean we need to possibly wait 2 more years for a decision on 100, or does that wait time begin from when visa 309 was granted? 
 
Hopefully someone can shed some light!  
Thanks!

			I submitted one day early, just short of two years. Does anyone know if this is a problem? 
It seems to be a bit of a process to withdraw an application only to resubmit tomorrow ... but now that I've done it, I'm nervous ...

 I am not sure how this is viewed. If they haven't sent out a refusal notice already you should be fine. I've heard stories about people being over a year late and all good, but not sure about longer than that. Also your eligibility is from your initial lodgement and not from grant date. Maybe ask Mark here on the forum about it.

 I have a question 
 
I don't have a job now,so I don't put any money into our joint account, 
and I don't ask my partner to do it, either. 
 
so it's no any record of how we use it since last October. 
Should I still hand in this information ?

			Hi, everybody  
I submitted my 100 visa application in August 2017, and it has been “Application Assessment in Progress” since then. I don't check on status very often because I expect it’s gonna be a long wait...anyway this morning I logged in to immigration account and noticed status has been changed to “further assessment “. I am not sure this means good news or bad news? Does anybody have the same experience? I always believe no news is good news. But this change in wording really worries me. Appreciate if any one of you has seen this words before can tell me your story. Thank you very much.

			Hi everyone,  
I noticed that there is a waiting room for people waiting on the Onshore Partner visa, but nothing similar (that I could find!) for those of us waiting offshore.   
There will be some similarities for both groups, but I thought it might be helpful for those of us waiting offshore to stick together for morale!  
We applied 6 weeks ago (and it feels like FOREVER!), and I've been feeling really down in the dumps about being offshore. All I really want is to go home and be closer to my family, and start building our lives together in Aus. I miss  home a lot. Unfortunately we can't go home until we have my partner's visa!  
We moved from Aus to NZ when my partner's last Aus visa ran out, and we've been essentially waiting here until we can go back home.  He's from the UK.   
I guess I'm just hoping that there are other people out there who have applied for their 309/100 and might want to keep in touch.

Dear Jmac01, 
 
Thanks for the concern for those who are waiting for partner visa 309/100 offshore as you do. 
I am one of you, and applied just before 2 weeks, less than  you are waiting!!!!!!! 
 
I am in Kenya, my wife and daughter in Brisbane, QLD. I am thirst for their reunification and wanted it to happened as soon as tomorrow, if possible, I know it is not. 
 
I am worse that Kenya is a high risk country. 
 
Wish you soon grant of visa 
Hassan

			Jmac, the reason is that the process and the experiences vary widely from embassy to embassy. So there are threads for specific embassies so you get information (and can commiserate with) people who are going through the same process as you are.   For example - the wait for a 309 from Kenya or Pakistan or Bosnia-Herzegovina can be 18 months or longer, but the wait for a 309 from, say, Berlin is more like 6-8 months. And the embassies handle the process very differently. That's why general 309 threads don't tend to last long - people seek out other people going through the same thing as them. 
 
As an example, if you talked to someone applying from the US they'd tell you it was just fine to apply for a visitor visa while you're waiting out the 309, and that your CO will let you know when to get offshore to get your visa granted, and it won't delay it (it's true in almost every embassy). But if that information was given to someone applying through India, they'd risk delaying their application by several months if they didn't time their visitor visa correctly. 
 
Just my two cents!

Thanks CollegeGirl. I knew there were embassy-specific forums but nobody seems to apply from New Zealand! So it's kind of sad to be all alone! I was hoping there might be some moral support since we're all offshore, some of the experience may be universal.  
 
Just a question you might be able to help with - now that most applications are online, do the applications still get assigned to an embassy?

			Yes, they do still get assigned to an embassy - whichever one is closest to you in most cases.  
 
There really won't be too many universal experiences embassy to embassy, unfortunately, except for the waiting (and even that will be different since some people have two years of waiting while others have six months, and some people can visit their partners while waiting and others can't). When a CO gets assigned varies, whether you get notified of this varies, how long your acknowledgment takes varies, how long processing takes varies, if they tell you how long processing will take varies, IF they stick to their quoted processing times varies, whether processing times are getting slower or looking like they might be getting better varies, which forms you need to provide varies, whether or not a tourist visa during processing could potentially affect your application processing time varies, what requirements they have for proving genuine relationships (to some extent) varies, what sort of marriage ceremony needs to have been had for them to view it as legit can vary, etc. etc. etc. It's insane how different requirements can be from embassy to embassy! Yikes.

			Hi! 
 
We are offshore too, I am British and my fiancee is an Aussie, we are applying for the 309 visa.  
We are living in Vietnam and applied coming on a month ago now! 
Would love to hear about anyone who has applied in Vietnam... I have searched and searched but cant seem to find anyone!! We have already submitted our police checks and our medical check!

			Good to hear from you guys!  
Bella, where is your partner from? (or you, if you're the one applying for the visa   ) We are also in the South Island, I'll see if I can figure out how to message you.  
Hi Jennie, I haven't heard of anyone applying from Vietnam - it's an unusual situation that we're in too, Aussie/Brit relationship and living in a third country! Looks like we applied at a similar time, so it will be interesting to talk about similarities/differences. We haven't heard anything from IMMI yet, but figured we won't hear anything for a while! 
 
additional: 
it will be interesting to see what the time frame is for NZ applications... the subcontractor (?) that processes applications in NZ says on their website that the time frame for the 309 is 12 months, but on the IMMI website it says the time frame is 5 months for low risk countries.

 Ignore that timeframe on the Immi website. It has not been updated for at least two years and is very misleading. There's no low-risk embassy anymore with an average of 5 months processing... I really wish they'd just take that wrong information down.

 Yeah I have struggled to find information on doing it through a third country especially Vietnam!! I would love to hear when you hear back from IMMI. 
We submitted everything including medicals and PC on the 13th of July but have not heard from a case officer or anything yet!! Keep me updated with how you get on!!! Good luck!

			We've decided to go to australia next month we hope, my husband will use a ETA while he waits for his visa to be approved. Meaning he will have to go offshore every 3 months and visit new zealand i guess. We made this decision very carefully as my mom (some of you may know from previous posts) has cancer and needs our support asap as she is having chemo injections.... my husband did call immigration and they told him it was fine for him to visit australia while he waits out the visa approval.... they told him to use a ETA or whatever to get in. he will most likely have a return ticket to either the US or buy a ticket to new zealand with a 3 month timeframe to get offshore to obey the rules on the ETA.

			Sorry to hear about your mum's illness, sharyny.  It is good that you are in a position to go to Aus while you wait for the visa! It is hard to be waiting offshore away from family but would be much worse in your situation. I hope she has a speedy recovery and that your partner gets his visa soon

 Welcome to the waiting room H.Protagonist   Although, you applied before me so you've been waiting longer!  
I'm impressed you've already had a request for police and medicals. We've heard nothing yet! I assumed that it was the CO who requested them, so it's interesting that you've been asked for them but not had a CO assigned! Best of luck... hope your visa comes through soon

 Hey, Jmac~ 
 
Thanks for the welcome. I haven't been waiting tooooo long, but the request for more info was certainly heartening even though a C.O. hasn't yet been assigned. The request for more information letter I got also specifically noted that my application had not been allocated yet, though, so who knows what's going on.  
 
I am hopeful that it means I passed initial clicks and it will be processed quickly. I just applied and was granted (almost instantly) a 600 extension on my tourist VISA, so fingers and toes crossed that that speed indicates something bigger in the VISA world like, ""This one's good to go! Grant away!"" 
 
We'll see how it pans out after I give them the heads up on my new stay situation AND let them know I'm heading to NZ for a trip in a week. Maybe the VISA gods will shine upon me twice and they'll just grant it while I'm there? Wishing you the best of luck as well! Perhaps we'll have an avalanche of grants as Immigration tries to clean their plates before Christmas.

			I would read about your visa here:  Maritime Crew visa (subclass 988) . It only allows you to work as crew on a ship. ""Offshore"" means OUTSIDE Australia (i.e., at sea, on a ship). Can't help on the work or salary. It definitely doesn't allow studying.

  As College girl has said you can only work on a ship off shore , you would have a basically no prospect of easily changing to a ""work "" visa. To do that you would need a whole new skilled visa application.

 Haha we are hoping they will say that about us too!  
We've been in and out of Australia together about 6 times in the past year, so we are hoping that might help show we are genuine and they will give us a speedy grant!! Of course, it probably doesn't work like that, but we can hope.  
 
No updates from us still, only that we can't upload any documents to our online application at the moment, and we need to upload our NOIM!

			Yo! I'm still waiting too. I'm currently in the UK with my Aussie boyfriend. I submitted my application April 14th and was assigned a CO 6 weeks later. He starts his job in Melbourne Jan 19th; we're planning on flying before Christmas so hopefully my visa will be granted before then. Anyone know of any other UK applicants?

No updates from us still, only that we can't upload any documents to our online application at the moment, and we need to upload our NOIM! 
 
 
 
 Hope you get your upload situation sorted, and fingers super crossed now that they grant my VISA quickly because I've just found out that I have an unexpected bun in the oven. My muffin of doom is throwing a wrench in this whole thing if they don't grant by Jan-ish...

 Hey, emkas. The process was very simple. Do you have an Immi account? If you do, you can apply electronically (just select that VISA and start a new app) and answer several sets of questions (which if you've done a partner or PMV online app you'll be very familiar with). You'll be asked your reasoning for the extension (visiting family and travel, in my case) and the extension date. They grant 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month extensions, though I think the 12 moth requires special circumstances. I requested 6 months from my current 12 month ETA expiry date. Once you've finished answering everything, submit, pay the fee, and then you'll be taken to a document upload page to attach evidence. 
 
Now, they ask for several things like proof of finances, proof of travel, etc., but I'd only managed to attach my marriage certificate, passport photos, and color passport scan before it was granted. Depending on your sit, they may want more evidence, so don't go by mine. Since I already have a 309 application in, they have my finances, addresses, etc. and maybe that's why they OK-ed it with minimal attachments. 
 
At any rate, that's it. It's always scary to fill one of those out and hit submit, but it went through just fine. Let me know if you have any other questions.

			Please check below and make sure your info is correct (and complete as you want it to be - if I don't have an exact date you applied and you'd like to keep it that way for privacy reasons, that's absolutely fine!) 
 
Also, if you're on this list and you did NOT apply for a 300 (Prospective Marriage Visa) or a 309, let me know and I'll take you off the list.  
 
And if anyone would like to be added - just say so and tell me your CO's initials (if you know), your application date, whether you applied for a 309 or a 300, and whether you applied online or via paper. Thanks! 
 
Also, please note: the date format for this thread is the United States date format, so 4/9/2014, for example, is April 9, NOT September 4.

			The good things we can deduce from this list are that very few people are up to six months' wait (with the exception of cheesy.  ). So the ~5 month average PMV processing time from DC still *appears* to be mostly holding steady. Hopefully we'll start seeing some grants soon before these five monthers turn into six monthers! 
 
My guess is the slowing of the grants is due to people being on vacation and/or the Australian election and we might see some grants coming soon.  
 
What else can we deduce? Well, ML is one busy woman!   Haha.

 When is your planned wedding date? You can go to Australia on an ETA however if you get married before the PMV is granted I think you will have to convert your application to a spouse visa. That will probably complicate things further.

 Yes, exactly right. MrandMrs, if you marry before it's granted you'll have to convert your application to a spouse visa and they'll be looking for the evidence that visa requires (so more intense than the PMV). It can also delay things.

			I was going to say maybe we should start a new thread, but we have so many DC-specific threads on the forum now I think maybe adding them to this thread would just be better.   So yes - I'll start a 309 section on my first post in this thread. It's impossible to tell with some of the new Timelines what visa people applied for, though, so - anyone with a 309, let me know and I'll add you to the list!

			Nice update! It's nice to see who else is waiting for a 309.  
 
I sent an email 8 days ago through the enquiry form, and asked specific questions about them needing any additional documentation...just to see if my case officer would directly respond. Received the most general answer....pretty sad it takes eight days for such a simple response :/

That leaves me as the only person waiting on RM for a 300... I don't know whether to be scared or glad about that, lol.

 Not quite sure what response you were expecting to get in the literal minute between your first and fourth question! 
 
To answer them: 
 
a) yes, there is a user above who has posted a timeline. He applied so late in Dec it effectively counts as a Jan beginning. 
 
Maybe others will post. Be aware this forum is largely used by people getting info and applying for partner/work etc visas. Once they have gone through the whole process and are finally eligible for citizenship, most people don't use the forum. So there will be fewer responses to these kind of questions, compared to partner visas. 
 
b) the process is explained here:  Australian citizenship 
 
c) do you mean for the test? I don't know, though I'd be interested to know how Melbourne is currently going too. You're asking about Melbourne but your timeline has Sydney in it. Where did you apply?

 The DIBP eligibility calculator is not consistent with the online application in ImmiAccount. I found that if you wait a couple of days after your 'supposed' eligibility date, you can proceed with your citizenship application without 'error' popping up. If it still happens after 2 or 3 days, I'm afraid I can't help. Best of luck.

 Scanned supporting documents do  not  need to be certified when applying for citizenship  online . But remember, you must take all the  original  documents for the interview, when you sit for the test.

 From the border website: 
 
 The following requirements apply to the period of time you have held a permanent Australian visa. 
 
You need penal clearance certificates from overseas countries if: 
 
 - you lived or travelled overseas since the age of 18 years or over, and 
 - the total time spent overseas added up to 12 months or more, and 
 - the time spent in any one country was more than 90 days, or 
 - you are requested to do so by the department. 
 
Provide a penal clearance certificate from every country that you spent more than 90 days in. 
 
Not sure if you've been  PR  the whole 9 years but it's irrelevant anyway because total time overseas is under 12 months. Going off the info you provided, I would say no, you don't need a penal cert (unless they decide to ask you for one!). Only count time spent overseas as a  PR , and check if you've been to other countries too.

 Note that this is 90 days continuously - it is not written anywhere on the website or in any of the application process. 
 
I spent months getting penal clearances from countries where i had spent 90 days cumulatively but not consecutively only to be told at the interview - oh thanks for getting those but you didnt need them.

 Thats exactly what happened in my case too. I applied on Saturday, received acknowledgement on the same day as well but the bridging visa was granted on monday. They did not back date it so i was unlawful for a day(sunday). That one day has put me on hold for like 8 months now.  (

			Hi  
This is Behzad, my wife applied for prtner visa on 8th of March 2018 from Tehran office in Iran and her case is tranferred to Beirut office on 19th of June. On 10th of July, we received an email from Beirut office that our application is transferred abd we will be in touch within the processing time. However, the processing time has changed to 21 to 26 months alternatively. This really freaks us out, how come we can be apart feom each other for two years?  
Is it even possible?

			I was thinking of applying for tourist visa during this period, is it possible to apply for a tourist visa and wait for the decision on this partner visa? When the visa is granted she can easily be overseas, since the applicant should be out of australia for the grant of this visa.

			Hi abdoal, 
Good that you have heard something at least. I assume they started to process the applications as the pricessing time is decreased from 26 months to 13 months, which is a good news.

			Hi all, has anyone recieved a request for more information from Beirut office? 
 
I have received a request for more info with a lot of items on the check list, basically all of the required documents for the visa are there and they all say “if not already provided”. 
I’m really confused about what it is they actually want more info about. 
 
We have already uploaded all necessary documents and police checks and medical.

I have received a request for more info with a lot of items on the check list, basically all of the required documents for the visa are there and they all say if not already provided. 
Im really confused about what it is they actually want more info about. 
 
We have already uploaded all necessary documents and police checks and medical. 
 
 
 
 I received an email and my partner got a phone interview and still waiting.

Good that you have heard something at least. I assume they started to process the applications as the pricessing time is decreased from 26 months to 13 months, which is a good news. 
When did you apply? And which office tdis you apply through? When your application transferred to beirut office? And when your status is changed? Could you share those? 
 
 
 
 I applied in Aug-2018. They asked for PCC and evidence of communication while apart.

Hi Diplomat, 
 
what do you mean by ""paper application was invalid""? 
 
Do you mean they rejected the paper application due to the lack of your birth certificate? 
 
I have applied on 3rd May 2019, 2 days after your initial application by paper form and they accepted. There was a certified copy of my birth certificate though. 
 
 
Please clarify for us here . 
 
Thanks

We are all set then and on the same boat. Almost 2 months now and the wait is long. Lets see what happens. I am so happy for the guys who applied in December 2018 and feb 2019. And they already got the test appointment. Imagine  people I know waiting for 20 months now.

 Entered Australia 17/12/16 + 4 years = 17/12/2020 
 PR  on 28/8/18 + 1 year = 28/8/2019 
 
Latest date of the two = 17/12/2020 
That's the date you can apply for Citizenship, after 4 years residence in Australia.

 What location? 
 
The location of the applicant can make a massive difference. 
 
Especially so for the eventual ceremony.  Our area only does two per year.

That is why I am seeking clarification from Jayson. 
 
I thought Jayson wanted to write ""2019"".

			Hi everyone. 
Can i ask if anyone has applied for citizenship in 2017 and still waiting for test invitation. 
If any ,plz share your timeline cause im still waiting from October 2017 and havent received test invitation yet. 
Is there any place to complaint about that long process that ruins all your future plans ,especially when you see it is unfair at all between case and case . 
So disappointed of that process. 
Opinions appreciated . 
Thanks.

 This is a great result for you jaydenj, I wish you the best for your upcoming test in October. 
 
On the other hand, it does baffle me, and probably others who have had simple applications in the system since the first half of 2018. This has to be one of THE most inefficient departments in all of government, with no accountability to anyone.

 I am sure not how they work to be honest. I did include a lot of documents in my application. All the police checks. This includes AFP and overseas. I just didn't want to take a chance.  
 
Was able to bring my test date forward to 9th of July using the online system.  
 
I still don't know how long the approval takes after the test. I am not holding my breath but I have seen a few cases getting updated with approval the very next day or within a week.  
 
Regardless, it's a very tiring process but the one that we have no control over; Whatsoever.  
 
Pity we are treated as commodities while all we seek is better opportunities but that's how the world works.

			Hi all, 
 
I have applied on my partner's 485 visa as subsequent entrant from offshore through a lawyer on the 02/09/2016 and yet to receive an acknowledge letter. 
 
My application was decision ready (lawyer advised that medical will have to be done upon DIBP request) 
 
Please advise current processing time for 485 subsequent entrant visa. Her 485 will finish on 29th December, 2016 and we do not have much time. 
 
Thanks in advance.

Sorry, I missed your post.

Do you know if there is any way to track progress of the application?

			If a sc485 application is decision ready, then it can be granted as soon as it been allocated to a case officer. 
 
Currently around 40 days, for a subsequent entrant, to be allocated. 
 
Have one lodged on 23/08, granted this morning. 
 
No upfront clearances (medicals and character), will take a bit longer. 
 
The medicals can be done before allocation. 
 
If the time is a matter, then you may to get it done as soon as an acknowledgment letter is received. 
 
Do not know if there is a reason there, which prevents you in doing so.

			Hi, 
I applied for myself (not through any lawyers or agent) de facto 485 subsequent so the schedule is: 
7/8/16 - received 
11/8/16 - acknowledged 
14/9/16 - medicals, australian police check (I've actually done this beforehand but mine is standard disclosure while they need complete disclosure. So i applied and got it like 3 days, PC in Aus is very fast) and insurance. 
Provided everything on 21/9/2016 
Visa granted 23/9/2016, so after only 2 days after you respond. 
Hope it helps

 Can you please advise how you imported the application into your immi account. I have tried to import with my application ID and passport details, but it was showing ""This service is not available right now""

 I just use Immi account to check my application. Do not import any thing to it because my agent do it for me. Sorry,I also donnot know how.

 You have to wait at least 6 weeks to have decision from the Immi. Hope everything will be good for us

			Hi,  
 
My partner and I have applied for the 820 partner visa and his bridging visa will kick in in september.  
 
We just moved back to Australia and are both looking for work. It looks like he will find a job easily as he has sought after trade skills. I on the other hand am highly qualified but am struggling to find work most likely due to gaps in my resume from chasing each other back and fourth between countries!  
 
Question 1) If I was to apply for centrelink help while looking for work could this affect our application?  
 
We both have savings but the move and visa and everything while looking for work is whittling them away...  
 
Question 2) I am thinking of retraining (post grad studies) and as such could apply for some financial help from centrelink while studying. Would this affect our application?  
 
p.s apologies if there is a similar thread somewhere else. I couldn't find it!

 The sponsor getting a Centrelink benefit does not impact the partner visa application. 
 
There have been quite a few people, 100% on Centrelink benefit, who sponsor a partner. 
 
Some complain that their benefit reduces from single rate to couples rate, from the date of relationship start.  Immigration and Centrelink do operate closely. 
 
Notifying Centrelink of the relationship, and accepting the lower payment, can be used as proof of relationship for the visa.

			Yes, as the previous poster said, there's no issue with you being on Centrelink- just also keep in mind that you will have to declare the relationship to Centrelink, and if your partner earns over a certain amount, you won't be eligible for any type of government assistance during your studies.

			Hi everyone,  
 
I beginning my 309 application. I m at the part where to provide my Relationship Details. There are five sections of which I should be filling in. I realized it requires 2000 words for each part. May I ask if I need to get as close to 2000 words as possible or 500 words to explain myself is sufficient?  
 
Moreover, if we don’t have a joint account and joint ownership of any asset (an apartment, a car), will that be critical to my application?  
 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
